Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1–Dependent Neutrophil
Adhesion to Endothelial Cells Induces Caveolae-Mediated
Pulmonary Vascular Hyperpermeability
Guochang Hu, Stephen M. Vogel, David E. Schwartz, Asrar B. Malik, Richard D. Minshall
Abstract—We investigated the role of caveolae in the mechanism of increased pulmonary vascular permeability and edema
formation induced by the activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). We observed that the increase in lung
vascular permeability induced by the activation of PMNs required caveolin-1, the caveolae scaffold protein. The
permeability increase induced by PMN activation was blocked in caveolin-1 knockout mice and by suppressing
caveolin-1 expression in rats. The response was also dependent on Src phosphorylation of caveolin-1 known to activate
caveolae-mediated endocytosis in endothelial cells. To address the role of PMN interaction with endothelial cells, we
used an intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 blocking monoclonal antibody. Preventing the ICAM-1–mediated
PMN binding to endothelial cells abrogated Src phosphorylation of caveolin-1, as well as the increase in endothelial
permeability. Direct ICAM-1 activation by crosslinking recapitulated these responses, suggesting that ICAM-1 activates
caveolin-1 signaling responsible for caveolae-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability. Our results provide support for
the novel concept that a large component of pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability induced by activation of PMNs
adherent to the vessel wall is dependent on signaling via caveolin-1 and increased caveolae-mediated transcytosis. Thus,
it is important to consider the role of the transendothelial vesicular permeability pathway that contributes to edema
formation in developing therapeutic interventions against PMN-mediated inflammatory diseases such as acute
lung injury. (Circ Res. 2008;102:e120-e131.)
Key Words: caveolin-1  Src  endothelial permeability  albumin transport  lung edema
Increased lung vascular albumin permeability leads to theaccumulation of protein-rich interstitial and alveolar fluid,
the characteristic feature of acute lung injury.1,2 Activation of
pulmonary neutrophils (PMNs) sequestered in pulmonary
microvessels is an important factor in the pathogenesis of
increased lung vascular permeability and tissue injury.3–5
However, the mechanisms of increased vascular permeability
induced by PMNs are not completely understood. Studies
have shown that activation of PMNs results in the release of
mediators (eg, oxidants and proteases) that increase vascular
permeability by disrupting interendothelial junctions,1–9
which normally form a restrictive barrier excluding plasma
proteins of the size of albumin and greater.10,11 Other studies
in lungs of sepsis-induced ARDS patients showed extensive
fluid accumulation in interstitial and alveolar compartments,
but in most cases, a well-preserved microvascular endothelial
junctional barrier.12 An unexamined mechanism of endothe-
lial hyperpermeability is the possibility of increased transport
of albumin occurring via the transcytosis pathway involving
the trafficking of caveolae across the endothelial barrier.1 It is
possible that in absence of gross interendothelial junctional
alterations after PMN activation, increased caveolae-
mediated transport of albumin, and concentration of albumin
in the lung interstitium, provides the necessary transendothe-
lial pressure gradient to maintain a high net transcapillary
fluid filtration rate. Although studies have suggested that
transcytosis is a mechanism of transendothelial albumin
permeability,13–16 its pathophysiological significance in PMN
activation-mediated inflammatory disease has not been
examined.
The continuous microvascular endothelium, the type pres-
ent in lung microvessels,1 establishes a semipermeable barrier
dependent on the assembly of adherens and tight junctions
that anneal neighboring cells and restrict the passage of
plasma proteins.1,17 Albumin, the most abundant plasma
protein, traverses the endothelial barrier by a vesicular path-
way.10,11 Albumin concentration of the interstitium is the
primary determinant of interstitial oncotic pressure.1 We and
others have described a role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the
primary structural component of caveolae and a scaffolding
protein, in regulating endothelial transcytosis.10,14–16 Cav-1
controls the formation and release of caveolae from the

plasma membrane, which shuttle macromolecules across the
endothelial barrier.10,11,13–16 The uptake of albumin via endo-
cytosis and its transcytosis to tissue is the result of fission and
trafficking of caveolae.13–16 Studies in Cav-1–null mice (Cav-
1/) showed the absence of caveolae and defective transcel-
lular transport of albumin,18,19 which could be rescued by
expression of Cav-1.20 Although mechanisms of Cav-1–
regulated fission and trafficking of caveolae are still unclear,
phosphorylation of Cav-1 on tyrosine 14 by Src kinase is a
key “switch” initiating caveolar fission from the plasma
membrane.21–27
The role of Src activation on caveolae fission and traffick-
ing and endothelial albumin transcytosis following PMN
activation is not known. Activation of PMNs with the
complement peptide C5a induced Src kinase activation and
increased endothelial permeability.6 In addition, exposure of
endothelial cells to H2O2 (a PMN-derived oxidant) increased
Src activity in association with increased endothelial perme-
ability.28 Crosslinking of endothelial cell surface ICAM-1
increased Src kinase activity,29–32 raising the possibility that
PMN adhesion to endothelial cells via the CD18/ICAM-1
interaction engages the endothelial cell caveolar transport
machinery. Whereas previous studies indicate that activated
PMNs induce an increase in albumin permeability, the role of
caveolae in the mechanism of increased vascular albumin
permeability has not been addressed. Our results suggest that
endothelial albumin hyperpermeability induced by transcyto-
sis of albumin contributes significantly to the development of
pulmonary edema induced by the activation of PMNs. Thus,
strategies aimed at blocking vascular hyperpermeability via
transcytosis may prove to be useful in preventing pulmonary
edema seen in acute lung injury.
Materials and Methods
An expanded Materials and Methods section is available in the
online data supplement.
Materials
Adult Sprague–Dawley rats (250 to 300 g) were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass). Cav-1–null mice
and corresponding wild-type (WT) cohorts, in the black Swiss
genetic background, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, Me) and Taconic (Hudson, NY). All animal experi-
ments were performed after approval from the University of Illinois
Animal Care and Use Committee. Rat lung microvascular endothe-
lial cells (RLMVECs) were obtained from Vec Technologies (Rens-
selaer, NY). Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Mo).
Cell culture, uptake and transendothelial transport of 125I-albumin
tracer, fluorescent albumin uptake, transendothelial electric resis-
tance (TER), dominant negative (dn) Src construct transfections, and
Western blotting were performed as described.21,23,24,33,34
Isolation of Neutrophils
PMNs were isolated from rat or mouse whole blood using the
hetastarch exchange transfusion and sedimentation technique.35
Cav-1 Small Interfering RNA Transfection in
Endothelial Cell and Rat Lung
Small interfering (si)RNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased
from Dharmcon (Lafayette, Colo). The sequences of Cav-1 siRNA
and negative control duplex were 5-UCUGUGAUCCACUCU-
UUGAUU-3 and 5-UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC-3, respec-
tively. Preliminary experiments showed effective siRNA-mediated
knockdown of Cav-1 in RLMVEC by transfecting cells with 10
nmol/L siRNA at 50% to 70% confluence using the protocol
provided by the manufacturer. All experiments were performed 48
hours after transfection. In vivo cationic liposome–siRNA com-
plexes were made as described.36 The liposome–siRNA complex
was prepared by addition of 0.25 mg/kg siRNA into 500 L of
liposome suspensions. Successful transfection of Cav-1 siRNA was
confirmed by Cav-1 Western blotting of lung homogenates.
Lung Preparation
Methods of isolation and perfusion of lung preparations were
performed as described.37 Permeability-surface area (PS) product, an
index of vascular permeability to albumin, was measured as de-
scribed.38 The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(40 mg/kg IP). The lungs were perfused with Krebs solution at a
constant flow and venous pressure.
Statistic Analysis
Data were expressed as meansSEM. One-way ANOVA and the
Student–Newman–Keuls test were used to compare the different
groups; P0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Caveolae-Dependent Increase in Transendothelial
125I-Albumin Transport Following PMN Activation
Activation of PMNs with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-
alanine (fMLP) resulted in a 75% increase in transendothelial
transport of 125I-albumin (Figure 1A). Neither addition of
unstimulated PMNs nor fMLP alone altered 125I-albumin
permeability (Figure 1A). The increase in albumin permeabil-
ity was dependent on the number of PMNs added (Figure
1B). To address whether intact caveolae were required for
the response, endothelial caveolae were disrupted by pre-
treatment with cholesterol-binding agent methyl--cyc-
lodextrin.33,39 Cyclodextrin prevented the PMN activation-
dependent increase in 125I-albumin flux (Figure 1C). To
determine whether increased transendothelial albumin flux
was the result of opening of interendothelial junctions, we
measured changes in TER. Activation of PMNs with fMLP
did not alter TER (Figure 1D), whereas in a positive-control
experiment, TER decreased by 60% from baseline
(5.950.58   cm2) for up to 60 minutes on activation of
PMNs with the phorbol ester 4-phorbol myristate 13-acetate
(PMA), which is known to severely injure the endothelial
barrier (Figure 1D).
PMN Activation With fMLP Induces Albumin
Endocytosis in Endothelial Cells
We next addressed the possibility that PMN activation
stimulated caveolae-mediated endocytosis of albumin in en-
dothelial cells, the initial step in albumin transport via
transcytosis.1,13–16 As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, fMLP
activation of PMNs increased 125I-albumin endocytosis by
endothelial cells within minutes. The response was dependent
on the number of PMNs added to endothelial cell monolayers.
Neither PMNs nor fMLP alone affected the uptake of
125I-albumin (data not shown). The increase in albumin
endocytosis was abolished by pretreatment with cyclodextrin
(Figure 2C). Fluorescence quantified as pixel intensity per
cell using confocal microscopy showed that fMLP stimula-
tion of 106, 5106, or 10106 PMNs induced significant

increases in Alexa 488 albumin uptake (Figure 2D), parallel-
ing the responses observed with 125I-albumin tracer.
Cav-1 Is Required for PMN Activation–Induced
Endocytosis and Transendothelial Flux of Albumin
fMLP activation of PMNs increased the phosphorylation of
Cav-1 in endothelial cells (Figure 3A and Figure IA in the
online data supplement), whereas PMNs or fMLP alone had
no effect (data not shown). Endothelial cells transduced with
Cav-1 siRNA showed 90% decrease in caveoilin-1 protein
after 48 hours (Figure 3A and supplemental Figure IA). These
cells were used to address the role of Cav-1 in mediating
endothelial transcytosis. As shown in Figure 3B and 3C,
fMLP activation of PMNs increased 125I-albumin endocytosis
and flux 2-fold in endothelial cells transduced with scrambled
siRNA, whereas Cav-1 knockdown abolished this effect. To
address further the role of Cav-1 in the PMN activation–
induced increase in albumin permeability, we compared the
effects of activated PMNs on endothelial endocytosis and
transendothelial transport of 125I-albumin in WT and Y14F-
Cav-1 mutant (nonphosphorylatable Cav-1)– expressing
RLMVECs (Figure 3D and supplemental Figure IB).26 PMN
activation-induced increases in endocytosis and transcytosis
of 125I-albumin were abolished in Y14F-Cav-1 mutant–ex-
pressing cells (Figure 3E and 3F).
Requirement for Src Phosphorylation of Cav-1 in
Signaling Endocytosis and Transendothelial
Albumin Transport Induced by PMN Activation
fMLP activation of PMNs significantly increased Src activity
in endothelial cells and pretreatment with the Src inhibitor
PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4,d]
pyrimidine prevented this response (Figure 4A and supple-
mental Figure IC). Activation of increasing numbers of
PMNs with fMLP also increased Cav-1 phosphorylation
(Figure 4A and supplemental Figure IC), 125I-albumin endo-
cytosis (Figure 4B), and transendothelial 125I-albumin flux; in
all cases, these responses were inhibited by PP2. Neither

PMNs alone nor fMLP alone elicited these effects (data not
shown).
To address further the role of Src phosphorylation of Cav-1
in signaling endocytosis and transendothelial albumin trans-
port induced by PMN activation, we transfected endothelial
cells with the pFB retroviral vector encoding dn Src. Total
Src protein in dn-Src–transfected cells was significantly
greater than endogenous Src protein (Figure 4D and supple-
mental Figure ID); ie, the exogenously introduced dn-Src
kinase represented most of the total Src protein. dn-Src
expression blocked basal Cav-1 phosphorylation, indicating
that inhibiting the activity of endogenous Src kinase pre-
vented Cav-1 phosphorylation (Figure 4D and supplemental
Figure ID). Expression of dn-Src also prevented 125I-albumin
endocytosis (Figure 4E) and transendothelial 125I-albumin
flux stimulated by activated PMNs (Figure 4F).
PMN Activation With fMLP Increases Vascular
Albumin Permeability and Tissue Water Content

Administration of 2107 PMNs or 5107 PMNs followed by
1 mol/L fMLP increased 125I-albumin PS product by 74%
and 140%, respectively, whereas PMN (2107 or 5107
cells) or fMLP alone (1 mol/L) did not alter 125I-albumin PS
(Figure 5A). To address whether the caveolae-mediated
transcytosis pathway was involved, we pretreated lungs with
the cholesterol-binding agent filipin to ablate caveolae40
before injection of the 125I-albumin tracer. As shown in Figure
5B, filipin blocked the stimulatory effect of fMLP-activated
PMNs (2107 cells) on 125I-albumin PS product. However,
transport of 3H-mannitol, a low-molecular-weight (182-Da)
tracer that traverses the endothelial barrier via the paracellular
(junctional) pathway,33 was not affected by fMLP activation

of PMNs. Also, Src inhibitor PP2 prevented the increase in
125I-albumin PS product but did not alter the 3H-mannitol PS
product (Figure 5B).
Because measurement of 125I-albumin PS product pro-
vides an assessment of the transvascular flux of albumin,
we also addressed whether increase in PS value resulted in
alterations in the final wet-to-dry (W/D) lung weight ratio,
a measure of pulmonary edema formation (Figure 5C).
Activation of 2107 PMNs in lung microvessels with
fMLP (1 mol/L) did not alter W/D lung weight ratio
(Figure 5C) in the presence of 74% increase in 125I-albumin
PS product (Figure 5A), whereas activation of 5107
PMNs significantly increased lung W/D ratio (Figure 5C)
concomitant with a 140% increase in 125I-albumin PS
product (Figure 5A). Neither PMNs nor fMLP alone
affected 125I-albumin PS product or W/D ratio values.
Thus, 2107 PMNs resulted in an increase in 125I-albumin
PS product but without pulmonary edema formation,
whereas 5107 PMNs resulted in a 2-fold greater increase
in 125I-albumin PS product and edema formation.
We next assessed the effects of siRNA depletion of Cav-1
in rat lung microvessels on vascular permeability. As shown
in Figure 5D and supplemental Figure IIA, Cav-1 siRNA
significantly decreased total rat lung Cav-1 expression com-
pared to scrambled siRNA-treated lungs. In lungs treated with

well as PMN-stimulated, 125I-albumin PS relative to scram-

We also carried out studies in lungs from mice with

decrease in basal 125I-albumin PS, as evidenced by the role of
caveolae in transporting albumin across the endothelial bar-
rier. In contrast to WT, activation of PMNs did not result in
increased 125I-albumin PS in Cav-1/ mouse lungs.

blocked by anti–ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Fig-
ure 6B and supplemental Figure IIB). Compared with control
IgG group, treatment of endothelial cells with anti–ICAM-1
blocking mAb also prevented the increased endocytosis of
fluorescent-albumin and 125I-albumin tracer, as well as in-
creased transendothelial 125I-albumin flux (Figure 6C through
6E) induced by fMLP activation of PMNs. Neither anti–
ICAM-1 mAb nor control IgG alone affected ICAM-1 sur-
face distribution and endocytosis of fluorescent-albumin
(data not shown).
In the rat lung preparation, we observed that administration
of anti–ICAM-1 blocking mAb (1A29), but not the isotype-
matched control mAb, significantly reduced PMN activation-
dependent increase in pulmonary vascular 125I-albumin PS
product (Figure 6F). Using the ICAM-1 crosslinking method
in endothelial cells,29,41 we observed activation of Src and
Cav-1 phosphorylation (Figure 7A and supplemental Figure
IIC). Neither Src activation nor Cav-1 phosphorylation was
seen following treatment with anti–ICAM-1 mAb, control
mouse IgG plus antimouse IgG (Fab)2 (secondary Ab), or
secondary Ab IgG (Fab)2 alone (Figure 7A and supplemental
Figure IIC). Confocal imaging showed ICAM-1 clustering on
the endothelial cell surface and increased Alexa 488–albumin
endocytosis (Figure 7B). ICAM-1 crosslinking also increased
125I-albumin endocytosis in endothelial cells (Figure 7C) and
transendothelial albumin permeability (Figure 7D).
Discussion
The present study demonstrates a novel role of caveolae-
mediated transcytosis of albumin in microvascular endothe-
lial cells in the mechanism of PMN activation–induced
increase in lung vascular permeability. Our results show that
ICAM-1 signaling activated by the binding of PMNs to the
endothelial cell surface promotes Src phosphorylation of
Cav-1, a requirement for activation of the caveolar transport
machinery.21–27 The increase in albumin permeability by
means of caveolae was also shown to be an important
mechanism of pulmonary edema formation. These results
suggest that caveolae-mediated transport of albumin follow-
ing PMN activation is an important determinant of the
formation of pulmonary edema.
In our studies, we induced PMN adhesion to endothelial
cells and activated PMNs with fMLP, a secretagogue specific
to PMNs (versus endothelial cells).42 We observed that
activation of PMNs increased endothelial permeability to
albumin dependent on Src phosphorylation of Cav-1. This
finding is consistent with the evidence that Src signaling is
required for the engagement of the caveolae-mediated trans-
cytosis machinery.21–27 Because endocytosis is the required
initial step in transcytosis, we used several approaches to
address the effects of activation of PMNs on albumin endo-
cytosis. Using 125I-albumin and Alexa 488–albumin tracers,
we observed that PMN activation with fMLP induced albu-
min endocytosis. The cholesterol-depleting agent cyclodex-
trin or siRNA-induced depletion of Cav-1 prevented the
endocytosis of albumin, indicative of a caveolae-dependent
mechanism. Using a number of PMNs sufficient to activate
caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis in endothelial mono-
layers, we did not observe a decrease in TER, a measure of
loss of endothelial junctional integrity. Finally, data showed
the inability of fMLP-activated PMNs (at a PMN:endothelial
cell ratio of 10:1) to disrupt interendothelial junctions con-
sistent with previous findings,43 whereas PMN activation
with PMA, a potent PMN stimulating agent, resulted in
decreased TER, a characteristic of severe endothelial junc-
tional injury. Thus, activation of transcytosis under these
conditions was not directly coupled to a disruption of endo-
thelial junctional integrity.
The present studies were also carried out in rat and mouse
lungs to buttress the endothelial monolayer studies and to
address in vivo significance of PMN activation-induced
increase in albumin transcytosis in endothelial cells. These
results also showed that the PMN activation-induced increase
in lung vascular permeability was dependent on caveolae-
mediated transcytosis of albumin. Pulmonary edema devel-
oped only in isolated rat lungs in which 5107 PMNs were
added to the perfusate. Interestingly, a lower number of
PMNs (2107 PMNs) added to the perfusate and then
activated with fMLP increased albumin permeability but
produced no pulmonary edema, whereas a higher number of
PMNs (5107 cells) induced a greater increase in albumin
permeability, as well as pulmonary edema. These results in
lungs, which are consistent with the effects of addition of
different PMN numbers to endothelial monolayers, suggest
that PMNs activated with fMLP increase lung microvessel
permeability via a caveolae-mediated pathway in a PMN
number-dependent manner. The more severe edema observed
with the higher PMN number may be the result of a greater
increase in vascular permeability to albumin because of
increases in both junctional permeability and transcytosis.
Our finding of reduced basal pulmonary microvascular
albumin permeability in Cav-1/ mice is consistent with
other studies in these mice.18 Using siRNA to decrease Cav-1
expression in mouse lungs, we have shown an increase in the
number of open interendothelial junctions and reduction in
caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis.44 The present stud-
ies are different because we have defined for the first time the
important role for activation of caveolae-mediated transport
induced by activated PMNs in pulmonary edema formation.
Although a constitutive level of transcytosis via caveolae may
be important in maintaining tissue fluid balance,1,10,13 the
present studies reveal the potentially crucial pathogenic role
of caveolae trafficking in the mechanism of edema formation.
There are several pathways available for the transport of
plasma protein the size of albumin and greater across the
continuous endothelium: caveolae, clathrin-coated vesicles,
interendothelial junctions, and micropinocytosis involving
caveolin- and clathrin-independent mechanisms.1 Caveolae-
mediated transcytosis is thought to be the primary mechanism
of basal albumin permeability across continuous endothelial
cell barrier.1 Transcytosis was reduced by disruption of
caveolae and inhibition of Src-dependent Cav-1 phosphory-
lation.21–25 Our findings suggest that binding of activated
PMNs increases vascular permeability through the augmen-
tation of this mechanism. Thus, caveolae trafficking repre-
sents the primary albumin transport pathway under basal
conditions in continuous endothelial cells, and, as we have
shown, it also contributes to the mechanism of increased

albumin permeability after PMN activation. Caveolae are not
detectable in Cav-1–null mice.19,20 However, a few vesicles
of the same size or slightly greater than caveolae were
detected19,20 but whose molecular identity has not been
characterized. These structures were noted in the original
Cav-1 mouse knockout studies by Drab et al19 and Razani et
al20 but do not appear to compensate sufficiently for the loss
of caveolae.
Transcytosis of albumin in endothelial cells requires the
binding of albumin to the albumin binding protein gp60 on
the cell surface,23,33 interaction of gp60 with Cav-1,23 and Src
activation.22 We have shown that Src phosphorylates Cav-1,
gp60, and dynamin-2 to initiate caveolae fission from the
plasma membrane.21,22,24 In the present study, we showed that
PMN activation also induced Src phosphorylation of Cav-1,
whereas expression dn-Src prevented the phosphorylation,

and, importantly, it inhibited endocytosis and transcytosis of
albumin. Thus, Src phosphorylation of Cav-1 is a key
determinant of PMN activation-mediated increase in albumin
transcytosis in endothelial cells.
To address how Src kinase may be activated by PMNs, we
focused on the role of ICAM-1 localized on the endothelial
cell plasma membrane. Previous studies have shown that
ICAM-1 binding to CD18 on PMNs mediates “outside-in”
signaling that can activate Src.30 We observed here that
activation of PMNs with fMLP caused endothelial cell
surface clustering of ICAM-1 and that anti–ICAM-1 mAb
blocked Src activation and Cav-1 phosphorylation, consistent
with a role of ICAM-1–induced signaling. We also observed
that anti–ICAM-1 blocking mAb prevented the PMN
activation-induced increase in 125I-albumin endocytosis and
transcytosis in endothelial cells. To address whether ICAM-1
may be directly responsible for signaling, we crosslinked cell
surface ICAM-129,41 to induce clustering and observed acti-
vation of Src and Cav-1 phosphorylation. Moreover, ICAM-1
crosslinking increased albumin endocytosis and transendo-
thelial albumin permeability, thus mimicking the effects of
PMN activation of endothelial cells. Recent studies have
shown a role for engagement of ICAM-1 by leukocytes in
mediating Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of
VE-cadherin as a requirement for transendothelial migration
of PMNs.43 Thus, our results are consistent with the emerging
concept that ICAM-1 engagement transmits signals into
endothelial cells that promote PMN migration45 and, as
shown in the present study, the activation of caveolae-
mediated transcytosis of albumin contributing to pulmonary
edema formation.
In summary, fMLP activation of PMNs increased
caveolae-mediated transendothelial albumin permeability and
induced pulmonary edema formation in rats and mice. The
response was initiated by ICAM-1–dependent Src activation
and Src phosphorylation of Cav-1 following the binding of
PMN to endothelial cells, which resulted in caveolae-
mediated transcytosis of albumin. Therefore, pulmonary vas-
cular transcytosis of albumin is a potentially important
mechanism contributing to pulmonary edema formation and
needs to be considered as a crucial factor in the pathogenesis
of acute lung injury.

Supplemental Methods 
 
Endothelial cell culture 
 RLMVECs (Vec Technologies, Rensselaer, NY) were cultured in high glucose DMEM 
supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/ml of penicillin, and 50 µg/ml of streptomycin. RLMVECs 
stably expressing Y14F-caveolin-1 were generated as described1,2.  Endogenous caveolin-1 level 
was not altered in this cell line. We and others have shown that myc-taged wild-type caveolin-1 
maintains its ability to drive caveolae formation2,3.  Confluent RLMVEC monolayers were 
incubated 2 h in serum-free DMEM prior each experiment. 
Antibodies and fluorescent probes 
 The antibodies (Abs) and fluorescent probes used were obtained from the following sources. 
Caveolin-1 mAb and pY416-Src polyclonal Ab were from Transduction Laboratories and Cell 
Signaling, respectively; α-tubulin mAb was from Sigma; c-Src polyclonal Ab, ICAM-1 Ab and 
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology; DAPI, goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa 568, and Alexa 
488- or Alexa 594-conjugated albumin were from Molecular Probes.

Treatment with drugs or anti-ICAM-1 mAb   
Confluent RLMVEC monolayers were incubated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2.0 mM),4,5  PP2 
(15 µM),6 or ICAM-1 blocking mAb (2.0 μg/ml) in HBSS for 15 min at 37 °C.  Filipin dissolved 
with DMSO was added at a final concentration of 300 ng/ml to the perfusate 90 s before the 
infusion of 125I-albumin in rat lung preparations.7  For some experiments, isolated lungs were 
treated with PP2 (1 µg/kg) or 2 mg/kg of ICAM-1 blocking Ab (1A29) or normal mouse IgG 
(control for ICAM-1 Ab) for 20 min prior to administration of PMNs or combined with fMLP. 
Dominant negative Src construct infection  
Dominant negative (dn) Src (A430V) in pFB retroviral vector was a gift from Dr. S. Parsons, 
University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.  Supernatant from virus infected Phoenix packaging 
cells was collected for transfection of endothelial cells.8  RLMVECs grown to 50-60% 
confluence were transfected with either empty vector or pFB-dn Src and used 48 h after 
transfection.  This dn-Src contains a valine substitution for alanine at residue 430 (A430V), a 
residue that is highly conserved in protein kinases, exhibits < 10% of the activity of WT Src.9  
Transfection efficiency was >90%. 
Isolation and activation of neutrophils   
PMNs were isolated from rat or mouse whole blood using the hetastarch exchange transfusion 
and sedimentation technique as described.10 The purity of isolated PMNs was >98% and viability 
was greater than 95% as evaluated by trypan blue exclusion.11 PMNs were activated by 1 μM 
fMLP in all experiments except for the transendothelial electric resistance study in which PMA 
(1.0 nM) was used. 
ICAM-1 cross-linking method 
 by guest on February 21, 2013http://circres.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from 
3 
 
ICAM-1 was cross-linked as described previously.12,13  RLMVECs were incubated with 10 
μg/ml of anti-ICAM-1 Ab at 37 °C for 30 min, washed and incubated with 0.1 μg/ml of goat 
anti-mouse IgG F(ab’)2 at 37 °C for 5, 10 and 30 min.  As a control, RLMVECs were also 
incubated with ICAM-1 Ab alone, anti-mouse IgG F(ab’)2 alone, or control mouse IgG and anti-
mouse IgG F(ab’)2. 
Endocytosis of 125I-albumin tracer   
Endocytosis studies with 125I-albumin were made as described.5,14,15  Confluent RLMVEC 
monolayers were incubated with 125I-albumin in the presence of unlabeled albumin at a final 
concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml in the different wells containing HBSS.  Endocytosis 
was terminated by chilling on ice and washed with acid buffer (0.5 M NaCl and 0.2 M acetic 
acid, pH 2.5) and with cold HBSS to remove both 125I-albumin and PMNs attached to the cell 
surface.  Cells were finally lysed with Tris-HCl buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, 1%Triton X-100 and 
0.5% SDS, pH 7.4) and the lysate was used to measure endocytosis of 125I-albumin.  Specific 
uptake of 125I-albumin was determined by subtracting the non-specific cell-associated activity 
(determined in the presence of 100 mg/ml unlabeled albumin) from the total (determined in the 
presence of 0.1 mg/ml unlabeled albumin) and normalized to cell protein.  The data are 
expressed in units of cpm/mg cell protein. 
Fluorescent albumin uptake, ICAM-1 immunostaining, and confocal microscopy   
For determinations of fluorescent albumin uptake into RLMVECs, confluent RPMEC 
monolayers were grown on glass coverslips and incubated with Alexa 488-labeled albumin in 
HBSS.4,8,15  Unincorporated tracer was removed by rinsing with acid buffer and HBSS.  
Internalized fluorescent albumin (green) was viewed by confocal microscopy in optical sections 
midway through the cell (pinhole set to achieve 1 Airy unit).  Cell nuclei (blue) were labeled 
 by guest on February 21, 2013http://circres.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from

with DAPI.15  For some experiments, isolated rat PMNs and/or fMLP  were added to the cells 
along with fluorescent albumin.  ICAM-1 immunostaining (mAb 1A29 + anti-mouse IgG Alexa 
568) was analyzed by confocal microscopy. 
Transendothelial 125I-albumin transport  
RLMVECs were grown on clear microporous polyester Transwell membranes (Corning Costar).  
The membrane inserts (inner well) were filled with HBSS containing 125I-albumin in the 
presence of unlabeled albumin at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml in different 
wells.  Fluid levels and osmotic pressure in the "upper" and "lower" wells were equalized to 
minimize hydrostatic and osmotic effects.  Aliquots from the lower chamber were centrifuged for 
2 min at 13,000 x g and the gamma radioactivity was measured in the supernatant.  
Transendothelial 125I-albumin permeability was calculated as described.15-17 
Transendothelial electrical resistance   
Endothelial barrier function was assessed using an electric cell substrate impedance sensor to 
measure real-time changes in electrical resistance across endothelial monolayers as described.18  
RLMVECs were grown to confluence in wells containing a small gold electrode.  The small 
electrode and the larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier.  
The voltage between the small electrode and large electrode was monitored by a lock-in 
amplifier, stored, and processed by a personal computer.  The data are presented as change in 
resistive (in-phase) portion of the impedance normalized to its initial value at time zero. 
Western blot analysis   
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% 
sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 44 µg/ml PMSF, 
and protease inhibitor mixture).  Equal amounts of protein lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE 
 by guest on February 21, 2013http://circres.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from 
5 
 
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked, and then incubated with relevant Ab.  The 
protein bands were detected using the ECL reagent (Pierce). Relative intensity of different 
proteins was measured using Scion Image (NIH). 
Lung preparations   
The mice or rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg i.p.) were mechanically 
ventilated with room air.  After thoracotomy, the pulmonary artery and left atrium were 
cannulated and the aorta was ligated so that the venous effluent could be drained into a left atrial 
cannula.  The lungs were removed en bloc from the thoracic cavity and mounted on a perfusion 
apparatus.  The lungs were then immediately perfused with Krebs solution at 37°C via the 
pulmonary artery at a constant flow and venous pressure.  The composition of the solution (in 
mM) was as follows: 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES, 11 glucose, and 
0.025 EDTA (pH 7.35-7.45) supplemented with BSA (3 g/100 ml).  A continuous record of 
pulmonary arterial pressure and lung weight was obtained via an in-line pressure transducer and 
a counterweighted beam balance during experiments.19 
Permeability-surface area (PS) product measurement  
PS product was determined following 30 min of administration of PMNs and fMLP using the 
"single-sample" technique.  With this approach, the accumulation of 125I-albumin is taken as a 
unidirectional protein flux across the endothelial barrier into the interstitium.19  The lung was 
perfused with 125I-albumin or 3H-mannitol for 3 min followed by extensive rinsing to remove 
tracer from cell surface and circulation.  PS product (in ml/min/g dry lung) was calculated with 
the formula A/(Cp · t), where A and Cp are concentrations of tracer albumin in the tissue and in 
the perfusate, respectively, and t is the perfusion time of the tracer albumin.
