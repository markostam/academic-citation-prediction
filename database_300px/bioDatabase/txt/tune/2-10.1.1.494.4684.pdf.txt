[1] With twelve years of seismic data from TauTona Gold
Mine, South Africa, we show that mining-induced
earthquakes follow the Gutenberg-Richter relation with no
scale break down to the completeness level of the catalog, at
moment magnitude MW 1.3. Events recorded during
relatively quiet hours in 2006 indicate that catalog
detection limitations, not earthquake source physics,
controlled the previously reported minimum magnitude in
this mine. Within the Natural Earthquake Laboratory in
SouthAfricanMines (NELSAM) experiment’s dense seismic
array, earthquakes that exhibit shear failure at magnitudes as
small asMW3.9 are observed, but we find no evidence that
MW 3.9 represents the minimum magnitude. In contrast to
previous work, our results imply small nucleation zones and
that earthquake processes in the mine can readily be scaled
to those in either laboratory experiments or natural faults.

1. Introduction
[2] At small magnitudes, several studies [Aki, 1987; Iio,
1991; Richardson and Jordan, 2002] have claimed evidence
for a termination of the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) [Gutenberg
and Richter, 1944] frequency-magnitude distribution
(FMD), which can be expressed as log N(M) = a  b(M 
MC), where N(M) is the cumulative number of events with
magnitude greater than or equal to M, 10a is the number of
events above the catalog completenessMC, and the slope b is
typically near 1.0. Such studies address a long-standing
controversy concerning the extent to which laboratory mea-
surements can be applied to natural fault behavior. On the
one hand, numerous reports [e.g., Kanamori and Heaton,
2000] suggest that the physics of rupture for major earth-
quakes differs from laboratory stick-slip friction, whereas,
on the other hand, others [e.g., Rice and Cocco, 2007;
Scholz, 1968] suggest that perhaps laboratory experiments
can be directly applied to natural faults. An extension of the
GR distribution to laboratory-scale stick-slip events would
support the latter suggestion.
[3] A lower limit of FMDs also has implications for
understanding earthquake hazard, both in terms of deter-
mining the size of the smallest earthquake that can trigger
other earthquakes [e.g., Sornette and Werner, 2005] and the
size of the nucleation zone that may slip before an earth-
quake rupture becomes dynamic [e.g., Dieterich, 1992]. If
slip in the nucleation zone is large enough, then it may be
possible to detect it prior to an earthquake, at least in ideal
situations, such as in deep mines, where monitoring instru-
ments can be placed very close to earthquake sources. We
therefore assess here the evidence for a minimum magnitude
in TauTona Mine, South Africa, as proposed by Richardson
and Jordan [2002].
2. Mining-Induced Seismic Catalog
[4] We analyze 285,007 earthquakes that were recorded
between 1995 and 2006 in TauTona Mine. Integrated
Seismic Systems International (ISSI) maintains the seismic
network in the mine and manually processes the hundreds
of 2  MW  4 earthquakes recorded each day. At any
time, approximately 20 stations operate in the depth range
1.8 km to 3.6 km. The standard network seismometers are
geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency; however, a
variety of other sensors are occasionally used as well.
[5] Catalog data from a typical week are shown in
Figure 1a, where the effect of the mine’s daily blasting
schedule is apparent. Ore production blasting occurs be-
tween 18:00–19:00 each weekday and on every other
Saturday (F. Rheeder, personal communication, 2007),
including Oct. 7, 2006. Stress changes associated with ore
production enhance seismic activity during and directly
following the blasting. No seismicity peak is observed on
Sundays when the mine is closed. Figure 1a includes events
located within 200 meters of the Carbon Leader Reef
(CLR), which is an extensive, tabular, gold-bearing vein.
Hypocenters of events within this distance of the CLR are
mostly within the seismic network and therefore are the best
located (typically have location errors of less than 40 m) and
have the best-determined source parameters. In TauTona
Mine the CLR is less than 0.1 m thick and is mined between
2.5–3.6 km depth (Figure 1b).
[6] Seismic moments in our earthquake catalog have
been determined by ISSI using the spectral technique
described by Mendecki [1997], based on Aki and Richards
[1980]. Frequency spectra were calculated for all events
with at least four identified phase picks at a minimum of
four stations. The spectra were corrected for instrument
response and stacked. The average displacement spectrum
was corrected for attenuation and fit to Brune’s model,
W( f ) = W0/[1 + ( f/f0)
2] [Brune, 1970], where W0 is the
long period amplitude of the displacement spectrum and f0
is the corner frequency. Seismic moment was then calcu-
lated from W0 as M0 = 4prVc
3W0R/<, where r is the rock
density, Vc is a constant wave speed set individually for
each station, and < is a root-mean square radiation pattern

calculated individually for P, SH, and SV waves and then
combined to determine a single estimate for the earthquake

MW using Hanks and Kanamori’s [1979] relation, MW =
2/3(logM0  9.1).
[7] To verify the ISSI catalog M0 values, we calculated
moment tensors for 35 earthquakes using the technique of
McGarr [1992] and compared scalar seismic moments
determined from the deviatoric component of moment
tensor to the catalog M0 values. The deviatoric seismic
moments calculated in our moment tensor study [Boettcher
et al., 2008] range from 1.2  105 Nm to 4.7  1012 Nm.
Over all, there is reasonable agreement between results for
this small subgroup of events and those in the catalog. The
few differences that we have identified, and are currently
investigating, have no significant effect on the results
presented here.

indicates that several types of earthquakes occur in TauTona
Mine, consistent with observations from many previous
authors who have investigated mining-induced earthquakes
[Gibowicz and Kijko, 1994, and references therein; McGarr,
2005; Richardson and Jordan, 2002].
[9] With data from 1998 and 1999 in five South African
gold mines, including TauTona Mine, Richardson and
Jordan [2002] (hereinafter referred to as RJ) observed the
same FMD as shown in Figure 2a (red curve). They noted
the sharp inflection of the FMD at MW  0 and interpreted
this as the approximate division between two populations of
mining-induced seismicity, which they termed Type A and
Type B events. RJ found that Type A events generally
cluster in time (<30 s) and space (<100 m), have enriched
high frequency source spectra, occur within 100 m of active
mining, and have an upper magnitude cutoff at MTypeAmax  1.
RJ associated Type A events with blasting, excavation, and
stope closures. By contrast, Type B events were found to be
spatially and temporally distributed throughout the mine
and have FMDs that follow the GR distribution. RJ pro-
posed that Type B events entail slip on pre-existing faults or
fractures, perhaps analogous to tectonic earthquakes, but are
limited to M
TypeB
min  0, consistent with the inflection in the
FMD (Figure 2a). Because Type A events were recorded at
magnitudes lower than M
TypeB
min , RJ suggested that M
TypeB
min is
a physical magnitude cutoff due to the nucleation zone size.
Although we also find both Type A and Type B events in
the mines, our conclusions, based on a larger catalog, differ
from those of RJ in that we see no lower bound for Type B
events.
[10] In this study, we separate earthquakes according to
time of occurrence and distance from ore production, both of
which strongly influence the catalog completeness MC. Tem-
porally, we separate populations by time of day (Figure 1) and
year of occurrence (Figure 2). Careful scrutiny of Figure 1a
shows fewer small earthquakes are recorded for two hours
during and following production blasting. This deficiency of
small events results from raising the trigger levels, which is
done so that small events do not overwhelm the system during
the several hours when seismicity rates are the highest.
[11] To obtain populations of seismicity with relatively
uniform MC, we separate earthquakes into four temporal
groups based on the level of mining-related activity and
recording trigger thresholds (Figure 1c). From low to high
levels of activity, these groups include events recorded
(1) on Sundays, when the mines are closed; (2) on working
days during the low-activity hours, 00:00–10:59 and
20:00–23:59; (3) on working days during high-activity
hours prior to ore production blasting, 11:00–17:59; and
(4) during ore production and immediately following when
the trigger levels are raised, 18:00–19:59. While the rate of
MW > 0 changed significantly between different time-of-day
groups (Figure 1c), indicating that, on hourly time scales,
the seismicity rate is tied to the level of mining activity, the
rate of MW > 0 showed almost no change for a time-of-day
group over the 12 years (Figures 2b and 2c), suggesting that
the overall rate of mining remained steady from year to year.
[12] Spatially, MC increases quickly with distance from
the network stations. To minimize changes in MC, we limit
our investigation to the best-recorded seismicity located
within 200 m of the CLR (within the box in Figure 1b).
4. No Scale Break Above MW 1.3
[13] Our simple separation procedure allows us to extract
groups of mining-induced earthquakes that behave like
tectonic earthquakes in that they follow a GR (power-law)
distribution (Figure 2c) and consist primarily of Type B
events, as defined by RJ’s clustering criteria (further than
30 s and 100 m of another event). Because the parameters of
the GR relation are sensitive to small variation in MC, it is
important to carefully determine MC. To do so, we follow
the procedure of Wiemer and Wyss [2000]. We use a
maximum likelihood technique [Aki, 1965] to estimate the
best-fit a and b values as functions of minimum magnitude
Mi, for M  Mi and then compute a synthetic distribution
from the GR relation using the maximum likelihood values
of b, a, andMC =Mi. For each Mi we determine the absolute
difference R(a, b, Mi) between the cumulative number of
events in each magnitude bin in the observed Bi and
synthetic Si distributions [Wiemer and Wyss, 2000], R(a,
b, Mi) = 100  (100 (
PMmax
Mi
Bi  Sij j)/
P
i
Bi).MC is determined
to be at the point where the synthetic power law models
95% or more of the FMD (Figure 2d).
[14] The populations of earthquakes recorded within
200 m of the CLR during the lower-levels of mining activity
(00:00–10:59 & 20:00–23:59 Mon.–Fri., and on Sundays)
show GR distributions with b-values near 0.85 (Figures 1c
and 2c). We compute MC values for the curves in Figure 2c
and obtain values of 0.3, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.3 for 1995,
1998, 2005 and 2006 respectively (Figure 2d). Using the
maximum likelihood method for M  MC, we compute b-
values at the 95% confidence level: 0.85 ± 0.02, 0.76 ±
0.02, 0.90 ± 0.03, 0.84 ± 0.01 for 1995, 1998, 2005, and
2006. In each year, MC is lowest on Sundays and the quiet
times of the working days.MC =1.3 for both time periods in
2006 (Figure 1c). By separating events into groups according
to the level of activity occurring in the mine, we find thatMC
for the low-activity hours is significantly less thanM
TypeB
min = 0
[Richardson and Jordan, 2002].
[15] Using RJ’s clustering algorithm for separating Type
A and Type B events, we find that 95% of the events in the
low-activity hours can be classified as Type B events.
Removing the 5% of Type A events does not change MC
or b. Data from 2006, when the seismic network capabilities
and data storage capacity were best, show that the FMD of
Type B events extends with no scale break to MW 1.3,
such that M
TypeB
min = MC. Thus, our results indicate that the
minimum magnitude for type B earthquakes proposed by RJ
was due to detection limitations, not earthquake source
physics.
5. Observations From NELSAM
[16] The above catalog analysis leads us to the question
of whether or not MW 1.3 could be the minimum magni-
tude in TauTona Mine for earthquakes that resemble tec-
tonic earthquakes. To address this question we present
L10307 BOETTCHER ET AL.: GUTENBERG-RICHTER DISTRIBUTION TO MW 1.3 L10307
3 of 5
initial observations from the Natural Earthquake Laboratory
in South African Mines (NELSAM) project, which consists
of a seismic network that spans 310 m laterally and 60 m
vertically and is located near the deepest part of TauTona
Mine (yellow circle in Figure 1b). The NELSAM seismic
network includes five weak-motion, three-component accel-
erometers (±3g), three strong-motion, three-component
accelerometers (±10g), and three three-component geo-
phones. The NELSAM seismometers have been recording
intermittently and thus have not yielded a comprehensive
catalog. Nonetheless we have excellent examples of indi-
vidual events.
[17] Some of our best-recorded small events include two
foreshocks to a MW 2.7 ‘‘mainshock’’, which occurred
when the mine was closed for production on Saturday
September 1, 2007 (Figure 3). The three earthquakes
occurred within 50 milliseconds of each other and were
recorded on four NELSAM seismometers, located at three
sites at distances of 27 m, 70 m, and 169 m. We calculated
a seismic moment tensor for the mainshock following the
technique of McGarr [1992] and assuming a constant Q =
200. We determined a normal faulting mechanism with a
scalar seismic moment of 1.2  105 Nm. We used the ratio
of the waveform amplitudes to estimate the seismic
moments of the foreshocks, which we found to be 1.5 
103 Nm (MW 3.9) and 9.5  103 Nm (MW 3.4), for
foreshock 1 and foreshock 2 respectively.
[18] The foreshock waveforms closely match those of the
mainshock, as shown in Figure 3d, where the ground
displacement from foreshock 2 is amplified by a factor of
12.6 and shifted by 9.9 ms, indicating the three events had
almost the same focal mechanisms. The match between the

between (e) the mainshock and foreshock 1 and (f) the mainshock and foreshock 2. The black curves in Figures 3e and 3f

pulse widths of the two events in Figure 3d is due to the
effects of attenuation and thus does not reflect the true
pulse widths or corner frequencies of the earthquakes. To
obtain an estimate f0, we computed the acceleration spec-
tral ratios between the mainshock and each of the fore-
shocks (Figures 3e and 3f), from the transverse component
using the 0.0067 s following the S-wave onset (indicated
by the horizontal lines in Figures 3a–3d). The record
length was limited by the short time interval between
foreshock 2 and the mainshock. Figures 3e and 3f display
model curves (black lines) for the spectral ratios, which
were calculated assuming all three events could be fit with
Brune’s [1970] spectrum and a constant stress drop model,
i.e. M0 / f01/3. We investigated a range of possible f0 values
for the mainshock, including 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 kHz. The
model curves in Figures 3e and 3f suggest that the
mainshock corner frequency is between 2 and 5 kHz,
which is consistent with an extrapolation of Yamada et
al.’s [2007] results.
[19] To estimate earthquake source sizes, we use Brune’s
[1970] model, r = 2.34b/(2pf0). For the mainshock, we
determine 0.3  r  0.7 m and, for the foreshocks, it
appears that f0 > 3 kHz, which implies r < 0.5 m.
Furthermore, the nucleation zone size of these earthquakes
must be smaller than 	0.5 m, and therefore well below the
length scale proposed by RJ of 	20 m.
6. Conclusions
[20] If there is a lower limit to the Gutenberg-Richter
relation for earthquakes in South African gold mines, then
we have shown that it is demonstrably below the complete-
ness of the catalog at MW 1.3, with, as yet, no minimum
magnitude in sight. The scale of our observations overlaps
those of shear failure in acoustic emission laboratory experi-
ments, which range from relatively large events [e.g.,
Thompson et al., 2009] to those 	2.5 orders of magnitude
smaller, approaching the grain scale [e.g., Lei et al., 2000].
These observations imply that if there is a length-scale that
constrains the smallest shear failure in the mines, then it
must be small; less than the rupture length for the smallest
shear failure seismic event. As the near source NELSAM
seismic array continues to acquire data, we will hopefully be
able to extend the Gutenberg-Richter FMD to smaller
magnitudes. However, we suspect that even with our high
quality seismic array and very short hypocentral distances,
we will not find a true minimum magnitude, because such
an event is likely to be of the order of the grain size.
