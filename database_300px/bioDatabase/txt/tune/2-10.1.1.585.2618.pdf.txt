[1] This study quantifies Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)-
related hydrological variability in the upper troposphere/
lower stratosphere (UT/LS) using Aura Microwave Limb
Sounder (MLS) cloud ice water content (IWC) and water
vapor (H2O). In a composite of six boreal-winter MJO events,
the UT/LS IWC anomaly is strongly positively correlated
with the convection (TRMM rainfall) anomaly. IWC
anomalies range from ±2 mg/m3 at 215 hPa to ±0.08 mg/m3
at 100 hPa. The UT/LS H2O anomaly has an eastward-tilting
structure similar to the previous-documented temperature
structure, but the H2O maximum lags the temperature
maximum by about a week. The H2O anomaly is positively
correlated with the convection anomaly in the UT (261 hPa)
and LS (68 hPa) but negatively correlated with the convection
anomaly near the tropopause (100 hPa). This analysis
provides a multi-parameter construct useful in validating
and improving the parameterization of convection, clouds and
cloud microphysics in MJO modeling. Citation: Schwartz,

1. Introduction
[2] The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant
form of intraseasonal variability in the Tropics [Madden and
Julian, 1994] and it impacts a wide range of phenomena, such
asElNin˜o/LaNin˜a,Asian-Australianmonsoons,mid-latitude
weather, tropical cyclones, and atmospheric composition
[Tian et al., 2008, 2007;Waliser and Lau, 2005]. To date, the
large-scale MJO convection and circulation characteristics
have been relatively well documented and in some cases
understood [e.g.,Hendon and Salby, 1994]. For themost part,
these studies have focused on quantities such as upper and
lower level winds, outgoing longwave radiation and precipi-
tation, and surface heat budget processes. In recent years, a
number of studies have also documented aspects of theMJO’s
vertical structure [e.g., Myers and Waliser, 2003;
Sperber, 2003; Kiladis et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2005; Tian et
al., 2006;Wong andDessler, 2007]. For example, in the work
by Tian et al. [2006], Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)
[Susskind et al., 2006] temperature and water vapor profiles
were used to document the evolution of the moist thermo-
dynamic vertical structure of the MJO. A notable limitation
of this study as well as the other studies cited, with the
exception of Wong and Dessler [2007], is that the data
sources of water vapor information above 300 hPa exhibit
considerable uncertainty, lack sensitivity and/or are based
on model-derived information. In addition, still missing in
the characterization of the upper-tropospheric (UT) hydro-
logical cycle of the MJO is a quantification of other
hydrological properties (e.g., hydrometeor budgets, cloud
ice/water, transports, etc).
[3] In this study, we use the water vapor (H2O) and cloud
ice water content (IWC) products from the Microwave Limb
Sounder (MLS) [Waters et al., 2006] on the Aura satellite to
quantify the variation of upper-tropospheric/lower-
stratospheric (UT/LS) humidity and cloud ice associated
with the MJO. These products are now available for a more
than three year period, filling significant gaps in our mea-
surement capability and allowing a more complete charac-
terization of the atmospheric hydrological cycle associated
with the MJO. Quantitative profiling of these hydrological
parameters is particularly important, as global climate and
weather forecast models exhibit considerable shortcomings
in the representation of the MJO [Slingo et al., 1996; Sperber
et al., 2000; Waliser et al., 2003b; Lin et al., 2006; Zhang et
al., 2006]. Model deficiencies in regards to the MJO are
thought to arise from gaps in our understanding of, and
coupling between, cumulus convection, the planetary bound-
ary layer, cloud-radiation processes, and possibly even
microphysical processes and ocean surface temperature feed-
backs [Slingo et al., 2005]. Having a better characterization of
the hydrological cycle in the UTwill provide valuable model
constraints on parametrized processes such as the degree
of H2O supersaturation, auto-conversion rates of cloud to
rainfall, as well as the contributions to ‘‘cloudiness’’ from
cloud fraction, mass and particle size. In combination, these
factors can help determine and quantify potentially important
feedbacks to theMJO, including thecloud-longwavefeedback
[e.g., Lin and Mapes, 2004] and the surface shortwave-SST
feedback [e.g., Wang and Xie, 1998; Waliser et al., 1999].
Apart from the specific intention to examine the MJO, this
study may also contribute to the stratospheric hydration
problem, as the MJO modulates both convective injection of
moisture into the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and circula-
tion between low and mid-latitudes [Eguchi and Shiotani,
2004;Wong and Dessler, 2007].
2. Data and Methodology
[4] This study uses MLS v1.5 H2O and IWC [Livesey,
2005]. H2O [Read et al., 2007] is retrieved on 6-surfaces-
per-decade of pressure from 316–0.1 hPa, and its overall

accuracy is estimated to be about a factor of two. In the
tropics, it has vertical resolution of 2 km at 316 hPa,
degrading to 3 km at 100 hPa and 5 km at 46 hPa, and
horizontal resolution of 7 km and 200 km across and
along-track, respectively. IWC, screened as recommended
by Wu et al. [2008], is retrieved on 12 surfaces per decade
of pressure (1.3-km spacing) from 261–68 hPa, and
should be interpreted as an average over a volume centered
at the measurement point, with extent 3 km in vertical,
3 km across-track and 300 km along-track. V1.5
underestimates high IWC values (^50 mg/m3) at pressures
greater than 147 hPa by up to 50% compared to the
improved, v2.2 product, but the spatial and temporal
morphology of the two products is generally similar, and
consistent, in preliminary comparisons, with CloudSat [Wu
et al., 2008] (see also D. Waliser et al., Cloud ice: A climate
model challenge with signs and expectations of progress,
submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research, 2008). The
v1.5 IWC noise floor is at 5 mg/m2 at 261 hPa and
0.5 mg/m2 at 100 hPa. Temperatures used are from
the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation
System (GEOS-4) [Bloom et al., 2005]. The Tropical
Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) merged-infrared
3B42 precipitation product [Huffman et al., 2007] is used
to identify the magnitude and phase of MJO events.
[5] For the MJO analysis and composite procedure, we
use the approach described in our previous papers [e.g.,
Tian et al., 2006, 2007, 2008; Waliser et al., 2003a]. Briefly,
all the data are first binned into pentad values at a 8 long
and 4 lat grid and then intraseasonal anomalies of the
data are obtained by removing the annual and quasi-biennial
(26-month) cycle and filtering through a 30–90-day band
pass filter. To isolate the dominant structure of the MJO, an
extended empirical orthogonal function (EEOF) [Weare and
Nasstrom, 1982] is applied using time lags of ±5-pentads
(i.e. 11 pentads total) on boreal winter rainfall for the region
30S–30N and 32E–152W [see Figure 1 of Tian et al.
2006]. While temporal filtering is done over the entire MLS
data set, EEOF analysis and MJO events thereby identified
are restricted to boreal-winter (Nov–Apr), when the east-
ward propagating form of the MJO is typically most active
[e.g., Waliser, 2006]. MJO events are chosen based on the
amplitude time series of the first EEOF mode of the rainfall
anomaly. Supplementary material1 shows the 11 time-
lagged maps of this EEOF mode as well as the time-
series of its projection, with the six selected MJO events
indicated. A composite MJO cycle is obtained by averaging
the 11-pentad blocks of IWC and H2O anomalies that are
centered on the six selected events.
3. Results
[6] Figure 1 shows IWC and H2O MJO anomalies for a
limited set of MLS retrieval levels, for latitudes 30S–
30N, and longitudes 32E–162W. TRMM-rainfall anom-
aly contours (+1, +2 mm/day in white, 1, 2 mm/day in
black) are also shown. Maps have been horizontally
smoothed with nearest neighbors ([1

suppress fine-structure variability arising from the limited

contours: +1 and +2 mm/day in white and 1 and 2 mm/day in black. 5 of 11 pentads are shown, and maps are limited to
30S–30N, 32E–152W.

statistics of six events. No smoothing is done in the vertical
direction. Anomalies propagate eastward from the Indian
Ocean into the western Pacific at a rate of 40 of
equatorial longitude in 10 days, corresponding to the typical
MJO propagation speed (5 m/s).
[7] IWC anomalies at retrieval levels up to 100 hPa are
highly positively correlated with convection anomalies and,
therefore, with one another. 147 hPa IWC anomalies have
correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 with anomalies at all
other retrieval levels from 215 hPa to 100 hPa. The
correlation of IWC with TRMM rainfall is 0.5 at 261 hPa,
0.7 at 147 hPa and 0.6 at 100 hPa. The magnitudes of these
IWC anomalies drops by a factor of 50 from 261 hPa to
100 hPa, with peak anomalous values (given the applied
smoothing) of ±2 mg/m3 at 215 hPa, ±0.8 mg/m3 at
147 hPa and ±0.08 mg/m3 at 100 hPa.
[8] No phase lag between IWC and TRMM convection is
evident in Figure 1. Ice densities of cirrus outflow which
remains aloft after convective events are small compared to
those of convective cores and are generally below the
MLS sensitivity thresholds (1.2–1.8 mg/m3 at 215 hPa,
0.1–0.15 mg/m3 at 100 hPa). Also, MLS 240-GHz
radiances, on which v1.5 IWC is based, are relatively
insensitive to small cirrus ice particles [Wu and Jiang,
2004]. Furthermore, the 5-day resolution of pentad-
averaging may obscure small time lags. The study of low-
density and small-particle-size ice distributions associated
with MJO will benefit as multi-year datasets from new
instruments such as CALIPSO [Winker et al., 2004] and
CloudSat [Stephens et al., 2002] become available.
[9] The right four columns of Figure 1 show MJO
anomalies of MLS H2O. H2O is positively correlated with
TRMM rainfall at 316 hPa and 215 hPa and is negatively
correlated with TRMM rainfall at 100 hPa [Mote et al.,
2000; Tian et al., 2006; Wong and Dessler, 2007]. H2O at
68 hPa is again positively correlated with TRMM rainfall,
and this correlation persists when H2O is interpolated to
isentropic surfaces (not shown), an indication that this H2O
anomaly in the LS is not simply due isentropic movement of
water vapor relative to pressure surfaces.
[10] Off-equatorial H2O anomalies associated with the
MJO’s equatorial Rossby wave gyres [e.g., Hendon and
Salby, 1994; Tian et al., 2007] are evident, particularly at
215 hPa and 147 hPa. Low-pressure subtropical gyres east
of the enhanced equatorial convection are associated with
negative H2O anomalies while high-pressure subtropical
gyres west of the enhanced equatorial convection tend to
have positive H2O anomalies.
[11] Figure 2 shows equatorial (10N–10S average)
pressure-longitude plots of MJO anomalies in MLS IWC
and H2O and in GEOS-4 temperature, for all longitudes.
IWC anomalies propagate eastward from Africa into the

anomalies averaged from 10N to 10S. Solid black lines are TRMM rainfall anomalies, with axes limits at ±3 mm/day. The
color levels for both H2O and IWC are on logarithmic scales in magnitude. H2O has one color per decade of volume mixing
ratio, with magnitudes less than 0.001 ppm in white. IWC has 3 colors per decade of density, with magnitudes less than
0.046 in white. The horizontal axis of each strip is longitude, covering the entire equator.

Western Pacific, in phase with TRMM rainfall anomalies
(contour lines), with anomalies reaching ±1 mg/m3 up to
178 hPa in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. At
316 hPa, GEOS-4 temperature and MLS H2O are both
positively correlated with the convection anomaly in the
eastern hemisphere. The temperature anomaly between
178 hPa and 68 hPa has structure tilting eastward with
increasing height, a well-documented feature of the MJO
[e.g., Kiladis et al., 2005; Tian et al., 2006]. GEOS-4
temperature shows a sharpening of the tropopause above
the positive convection anomaly, cooling at 100 hPa
and warming at 68 hPa and in the lower troposphere. At
178–68 hPa, H2O also has an eastward tilting vertical
structure similar to that seen in temperature, but the H2O
anomaly lags the temperature anomaly by 8–10 days from
215–147 hPa and by 5–6 days at 121 hPa and 100 hPa.
MJO modulation of H2O at 215 hPa and deeper in the
troposphere is controlled by direct convective injection of
moist air, while at 100 hPa dry and cold anomalies above
enhanced convection are positively correlated, but causal
relationships are uncertain [e.g., Mote et al., 2000; Wong
and Dessler, 2007].
4. Conclusions
[12] The combination of the MLS IWC and H2O products
provide a previously-unavailable picture of UT/LS hydro-
logical processes associated with the MJO. Intraseasonal
(30–90 day) variability in MLS IWC and H2O and GEOS-4
temperature was composited over six boreal-winter MJO
events identified with a TRMM-rainfall-based index. A
schematic of the equatorial composite anomalous structure
of IWC, H2O, temperature and rainfall associated with the
MJO is summarized in Figure 3. IWC anomalies between
261 hPa and 100 hPa are spatially and temporally highly
positively correlated with convective anomalies, with mag-
nitudes ranging from ±2 mg/m3 at 215 hPa to ±0.08 mg/m3
at 100 hPa. The UT/LS H2O anomaly has an eastward-
tilting structure similar to the previous-documented
temperature structure but H2O lags temperature by 8–
10 days from 215–147 hPa and by 5–6 days at 121–
100 hPa. The H2O anomaly is positively correlated with
the convection anomaly in the UT (261hPa) and LS (68 hPa)
but negatively correlated with the convection anomaly near
the tropopause (100 hPa).
[13] Given the great difficulties that GCMs still have at
reproducing the MJO, both in weather forecast and climate
simulation contexts, it is imperative that additional obser-
vational constraints be developed and applied. Since it is
thought that correct parameterization of convection, and
possibly clouds and cloud microphysics, lie at the heart of
the MJO simulation problem, the multi-parameter view of
the hydrological cycle of the MJO that is coalesced into
Figure 3 can provide such a constraint. It includes key
features of the cloud-radiation-dynamical interactions that
are thought to be important to a realistic representation of
the MJO. Moreover, due to the widespread vertical mixing
associated with the disturbed phase of the MJO and the
associated influence on atmospheric composition [e.g.,
Wong and Dessler, 2007; Tian et al., 2007, 2008], it will
be important to continue to develop multi-parameter vali-
dation constructs. The A-train sensors [Stephens et al.,
2002] including MLS, CloudSat and CALIPSO provide a
suite of relevant, nearly-collocated measurements that will
be particularly valuable to this end.
