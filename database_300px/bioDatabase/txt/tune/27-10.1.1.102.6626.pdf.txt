ABSTRACT
RNA interference (RNAi) is an intracellular mechan-
ism for post-transcriptional gene silencing that is
frequently used to study gene function. RNAi is initi-
ated by short interfering RNA (siRNA) of 21 nt in
length, either generated from the double-stranded
RNA(dsRNA)byusing theenzymeDiceror introduced
experimentally. Following association with an RNAi
silencing complex, siRNA targets mRNA transcripts
that have sequence identity for destruction. A pheno-
type resulting from this knockdown of expression
may inform about the function of the targeted gene.
However, ‘off-target effects’ compromise the speci-
ficity of RNAi if sequence identity between siRNA
and random mRNA transcripts causes RNAi to
knockdown expression of non-targeted genes. The
complete off-target effects must be investigated sys-
tematically on each gene in a genome by adjusting a
group of parameters, which is too expensive to con-
duct experimentally and motivates a study in silico.
This computational study examined the potential for
off-target effects of RNAi, employing the genome
and transcriptome sequence data of Homo sapiens,
Caenorhabditis elegans and Schizosaccharomyces
pombe. The chance for RNAi off-target effects proved
considerable, ranging from 5 to 80% for each of the
organisms, when using as parameter the exact iden-
tity between any possible siRNA sequences (arbitr-
ary length ranging from 17 to 28 nt) derived from a
dsRNA (range 100–400 nt) representing the coding
sequences of target genes and all other siRNAs within
the genome. Remarkably, high-sequence specificity
and low probability for off-target reactivity were
optimally balanced for siRNA of 21 nt, the length
observed mostly in vivo. The chance for off-target
RNAi increased (although not always significantly)
with greater length of the initial dsRNA sequence,
inclusion into the analysis of available untranslated
region sequences and allowing for mismatches
between siRNA and target sequences. siRNA seq-
uences from within 100 nt of the 50 termini of coding
sequences had low chances for off-target reactivity.
This may be owing to coding constraints for sig-
nal peptide-encoding regions of genes relative to
regions that encode for mature proteins. Off-target
distribution varied along the chromosomes of
C.elegans, apparentlyowingto theuseofmore unique
sequences in gene-dense regions. Finally, biological
and thermodynamical descriptors of effective siRNA
reduced the number of potential siRNAs compared
with those identified by sequence identity alone,
but off-target RNAi remained likely, with an off-
target error rate of 10%. These results also suggest
a direction for future in vivo studies that could both
help in calibrating true off-target rates in living
organisms and also in contributing evidence toward
the debate of whether siRNA efficacy is correlated
with, or independent of, the target molecule. In sum-
mary, off-target effects present a real but not pro-
hibitive concern that should be considered for RNAi
experiments.
INTRODUCTION
RNA interference (RNAi) (1) is an intracellular mechanism
for post-transcriptional gene silencing that most probably
functions in the regulation of gene expression and defense
against transposable DNA elements and viruses. RNAi is trig-
gered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Dicer, an enzyme
with RNAse activity, cleaves dsRNA into fragments of 21 nt,
termed short interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA associates
with several proteins to form an RNAi silencing complex
(RISC). The sequence of the minus-strand of the siRNA then

targets mRNA molecules that have sequence identity
for cleavage by RISC. This sequence-directed removal of
particular mRNA transcript yields a knockdown of expression
of the affected gene. Extensive investigations are ongoing to
gain more detailed understanding of RNAi. RNAi has been
widely used as an experimental tool for the study of gene
function and can be applied for large-scale analyses (2–4).
RNAi has aroused a great deal of excitement in both thera-
peutic and genomic experimental communities because of
its potentials for the treatment of a wide spectrum of dis-
eases, such as HIV (5,6), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and
Huntington’s diseases (7), certain classes of cancers (8–10)
and hypercholesterolemia (11,12), as well as its demonstrated
use in functional genomic studies via controlled gene
knockdown (13–15).
Both dsRNA and siRNA have been used to knockdown the
expression of genes of interest. Resulting phenotypes are then
used to infer gene function. Unfortunately, RNAi is not with-
out some complications. Empirically, RNAi was shown to
function in many different organisms. However, some organ-
isms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Trypanosoma cruzei and
Leishmania major) are considered to be RNAi-negative,
based on the lack of experimental observations for specific
knockdown of targeted genes and on the absence of compon-
ents, such as Dicer and RISC, in the genes of these organisms
that are critical for effective RNAi (16,17). More importantly,
concern has arisen that the specificity of RNAi, targeted by the
sequence of siRNA, may not be perfect. Initially, RNAi was
regarded as a highly specific means of gene repression. Several
studies dealing with various model systems supported this idea
(13,18–20). However, still siRNA can direct RNAi to target
mRNA sequences that lack complete sequence identity (21).
Agrawal et al. (4) forwarded concerns over specificity of gene
repression in RNAi. Saxena et al. (22) have demonstrated
the effect of siRNA mismatches on target specificity in
mammalian tissue culture cells and reported ‘off-target’
gene knockdown. Sequence identity of as few as 11 contiguous
nucleotides to siRNA caused direct silencing of non-target
genes in experiments conducted on specificity of siRNA in
cultured human cells (23). Scacheri et al. (24) pointed out that
mismatches between siRNA and target sequences could have
caused off-target RNAi in mammalian cells but such effects
are difficult to detect. Combined, the above examinations of
RNAi off-target effects have yielded mixed results. Perhaps
as a consequence, RNAi studies do not explicitly control for
off-target effects on a routine basis.
Of course, a lack of specificity resulting in knockdown of
unknown or unintended genes has considerable negative
implications for functional genomics. Target specificity is
also of paramount importance when considering applications
of RNAi in therapeutics (3,4). For clarification of these
uncertainties regarding RNAi, the off-target effect should
be evaluated for each gene expressed by the organism
under study, by considering multiple possible factors affecting
off-target silencing. Such comprehensive studies are most
probably expensive and cumbersome to conduct experiment-
ally. A computational approach is less expensive to implement
and permits the extension of real parameters into wider ranges
for fully observing the trends and effects upon RNAi speci-
ficity. This work represents a systematic computational study
of RNAi-related off-target effects in several organisms.
Current guidelines for the design of siRNA and dsRNA for
RNAi experiments recommend BLAST similarity searches
(25) against sequence databases to identify potential off-
target genes to improve the likelihood that only the intended
single gene is targeted (26). However, the BLAST algorithm
was not specifically designed to assess RNAi off-target effects.
Therefore, dedicated computational methods were developed
for improved detection of sequence identity to accurately and
systematically evaluate RNAi off-target effects between
siRNA sequences and target genes on a transcriptome-wide
scale. In this computational study, three organisms, Schizo-
saccharomyces pombe (fission yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans
and Homo sapiens (human) were examined. The likelihood of
off-target effects for all known genes in each of these
organisms were evaluated, including factors that may impact
the target specificity and efficiency of RNAi. These factors
included the length of siRNA, the length of dsRNA, the length
of siRNA-target sequence mismatch, the position of mismatch
within the siRNA sequence, the position of dsRNA within its
target, coding sequences (CDSs) and untranslated regions
(UTRs) as targets for RNAi, the chromosomal location and
density of genes, and the effect of siRNA selection by rational
siRNA design (27). These analyses were aimed to gain insights
toward improving specificity of RNAi for functional genomics
and potential future therapeutic application by facilitating a
better understanding of off-target effects of RNAi. It would
also be desirable to include effects such as RNAi directed
against promoter regions, concentration dependences and
the non-linear silencing effects of siRNA pools. Unfortu-
nately, published empirical data on such effects are currently
sparse that we cannot construct a reasonable computational
model for them, hence these classes of interactions are omitted
from this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sequence data
The sequence data used in this study were collected from the
S.pombe, C.elegans and H.sapiens. RNAi has been observed in
each of these organisms and extensive sequence data, includ-
ing full genome sequences, were available for analysis. These
three organisms represent a wide phylogenetic range. We used
the cDNA sequences of 5401 genes of S.pombe available at the
Sanger Institute (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/yeast/pombe). The
cDNA sequences from 22 168 genes of C.elegans (release
WS110) were obtained from the Wormbase at Sanger Institute.
The collective sequence data considered to represent 30-UTR
sequences from C.elegans consisted of 1000 UTRs that were
present in the expressed sequence tag database combined with
sequences that resulted from the UTR prediction method of
Hajarnavis et al. (28). The dataset of human genes represent-
ing 27 852 mRNAs with 30-UTRs was taken from the RefSeq
database at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Modeling RNAi and off-target effects
Although computational methods exist to model aspects of
mechanisms that employ short RNA sequences to regulate
gene expression, such as microRNA (miRNA) genes
(29,30), miRNA targets (31,32) and siRNA efficacy (33–35),
none was available to study RNAi off-target effects. Thus,
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 6 1835
dedicated computational methods were developed for
improved detection of sequence identity to accurately and
systematically evaluate RNAi off-target effects based on
sequence identity between siRNA sequences and target
genes on a transcriptome-wide scale.
RNAi is guided by complete and near complete sequence
identity of siRNA and the target mRNA transcript (21–23).
siRNA sequences are generated by the activity of Dicer, an
enzyme that cleaves long dsRNA into fragments of 21 bp
(19). To model RNAi, we determined the incidence of
sequence identity (exact and allowing for some mismatch)
of each of all possible siRNA sequences (arbitrary length
range of 17–29 nt) derived from the length of dsRNA (100,
200, 300 and 400 nt starting at the first coding nucleotide, and
the sequence region from 100 to 200 nt) representing any of
the CDSs relative to all possible siRNA sequences predicted
from the CDSs of each of the organisms studied. Sequence
identity of the siRNA derived from a given gene by using
another gene was considered to signify a potential off-target
RNAi. To mimic RNAi that is directed through siRNA with
sequence identity to the UTRs of mRNA transcripts, both
upstream and downstream UTR sequences (if available)
were included for the analysis of off-target effects. With
these variables, the effect of length of both siRNA and initial
dsRNA upon the chance of off-target effects was investigated.
This was implemented as follows.
The similarity between two oligonucleotides is computed
with inner product in the feature space using the n-gram
feature map, as described previously (36). The use of an
inverted file and red black tree (RBT) for calculating the
inner products in the feature space achieved efficient compu-
tational performance.
Computational representation of siRNA-target binding
We describe each gene by its possible contiguous sub-
sequences of length n (typically 21, Table 1 and Figure 1
explain the parameters used in our computational model),
called n-grams or n-mers. We consider each gene to be a doc-
ument described by its coordinates that are indexed into the
n-mer space. More formally, each gene gx in the input space X ,
consisting of a sequence of characters drawn from the alphabet

Figure 1. Graphic depiction of variables tested computationally to investigate chance of off-target effect in each of the three organisms (H.sapiens, C.elegans and
S.pombe). (A) General considerations: a target sequence (representing one particular expressed mRNA) is used as the source of dsRNA of which a pool of all possible
siRNA is derived (mimicking the action of Dicer). Each sequence within the siRNA pool was compared for sequence identity (exact: m = 0; with mismatch: m > 0) to
all possible siRNA sequences in the transcriptome through the feature map F() to determine chance of off-target errors. The parameters tested are as follows: (B)
length of siRNA (n); (C) length of dsRNA (l ); (D) addition of available UTR data in the target sequences (u3 and u5); and (E) position of the dsRNA along the target
sequence (pos).

A = fa, c, g, tg, j A j ¼ 4, is mapped onto an n-gram feature
space, N4
n
, by the feature map of exact match
Fexn gxð Þ ¼ fa gxð Þ½ a2An ‚ 1
where fa gxð Þ is the number of times n-gram a occurs in gx.
Therefore, the image of a gene gx consists of its coordinates in
the feature space indexed by the number of occurrences of
each of its constituent n-mers. A gene gy is said to match gene
gx if the following condition is satisfied
Kðgx‚gyÞ ¼ hFexn gxð Þ‚Fexn ðgyÞi > T‚ 2
for a predefined threshold T. Then, the similarity measure
defined using the inner product in the feature space,
Kðgx‚gyÞ ¼ hFexn gxð Þ‚Fexn ðgyÞi in Equation 2, actually defines
a kernel function that can be used in a support vector machine
classifier (37). Here, we use the kernel to match two sequences
instead of classification. For modeling RNAi, we choose T = 1,
since any match between an siRNA and its target mRNA
will cause the target to be knocked down. There is evidence
that such similarity measures are appropriate models of
RNAi off-target effects (23). However, using the feature map
in Equation 1 with T = 1 establishes a lower bound on cross-
reactivity. When more complicated RNAi-binding functions,
such as mismatch, wobble and bulge, are modeled, different
feature maps could be used than in Equation 1. Changing the
value of T can make the similarity measure stronger or weaker.
A simple example helps to explain how Equation 2 works. To
compute the similarity measure on short sequences O1 = aacgac
and O2 = aacgtgg using 3mer (n = 3) exact match, they are
mapped onto the feature space as Fexn O1ð Þ ¼ faac‚acg‚
cga‚gacg andFexn O2ð Þ ¼ faac‚acg‚cgt‚gtg‚ tggg. Since 3mers
aac and acg occur in both of them, hFexn O1ð Þ‚Fexn O2ð Þi ¼
1 þ 1 ¼ 2. Therefore, these two sequences match each
other given the parameter and the criterion. For additional
details on the kernel function and the computation of the
similarity measure, we refer the interested reader to Ref. (38).
Computing the similarity of Equation 2 to find the off-target
error in the genome using vector space model directly requires
O(DF4n) time, where F (40 · 106 for C.elegans and 60 · 106
for human) is the number of n-grams in the genome that may
include UTR sequence and D (close to F) is the amount of
n-grams to be compared in the CDSs. For genome-wide scan-
ning, this computing time is prohibitive and can be improved
by using the sparsity of the feature vectors. We use an inverted
file where the n-grams serve as identifiers and their gene names
and positions within the genes serve as attributes (the positions
are used for mismatches later). If we ignore n-mers having
zero occurrence and allow for the duplication of n-mers, a gene
gx can be represented in the feature space compactly
Fexn gxð Þ ¼ f a1‚p1ð Þ‚ a2‚p2ð Þ‚ . . . ‚ akx ‚pkx
 g‚ 3
where aj, 1 < j < kx, is the j-th n-gram, pj is its position on gx
and kx is the number of n-mers in gene gx with UTRs being
optionally included. If the length of gx is Lx, then kx ¼ Lx
n þ 1. In the inverted file, the records for gene gx contains the
triples ha1‚gx‚p1i‚ha2‚gx‚p2i‚ha3‚gx‚p3i‚ . . . ‚hakx ‚gx‚pkxi.
The inverted file for the genome of an organism is the collec-
tion of the triples of its genes. To speed up computation, we
sort the inverted file on the n-mer fields using a RBT, which is
a balanced binary search tree and guarantees logarithmic
search performance.
K(gx, gy) in Equation 2 is computed by searching each n-mer
of gx for gy in the inverted file. K(gx, gy) is the number of
occurrence of gy among the matched genes. Each search in the
RBT takes O(log F) time, resulting in a time of O(kxlog F ) for
computing K(gx, gy).
Definition of off-target error rate
We define the off-target error using the exact match feature
map. However, it is the same for the mismatch feature map
defined later. To simulate Dicer’s cleavage of dsRNA into
siRNAs, we take an oligonucleotide, ox, as dsRNA from gene
gx and map it onto the feature space, expressed compactly as
Fexn oxð Þ ¼ f s1‚p1ð Þ‚ s2‚p2ð Þ‚ . . . ‚ slx ‚plx
 g‚ 4
where sj, 1 < j < lx, is the j-th n-mer in ox and lx is the
maximum number of n-grams in ox. To obtain the matched
genes based on Equation 2, we compute the inner product
hFexn oxð Þ‚Fexn ðgyÞi for each gene gy in the genome, 1 <
y < G, where G is the total number of genes in the genome.
To assess the off-target error rates, we employ measures
from information retrieval theory. Let Cx ¼ fgx1 ‚gx2 ‚ . . . g be
the set of genes matched by ox, not including gx itself. The
precision of a search is the proportion of correct documents to
the total number of documents returned by the search. Here,
only gx is correct and the total number of genes returned is
1 þ jCx j , where jCx j is the number of genes in Cx. There-
fore, the precision of ox, thus of gene gx, is Px ¼ 1=
1 þ jCx jð Þ. We define the off-target error as Ex ¼ 1Px,
so that
Ex ¼ jCx j
1 þ jCx j : 5
If Cx is empty, indicating that gene gx is similar only to itself,
then the precision is 100% and the off-target error is zero. The
more genes in the set Cx, the larger off-target error silencing
gene gx will have.
We take an oligonucleotide as dsRNA from each gene in the
genome and compute its off-target error and average the errors
for all genes to evaluate the effects of the parameters. Thus, we
define the average error rate for a given parameter set to be
E Qð Þ ¼ 1
G
XG
i¼1
Ei‚ 6
where Ei is the error for gene gi and Q is the set of parameters
Q ¼ hl‚pos‚n‚m‚mpos‚u3‚u5‚ri: 7
In the above expression, n is siRNA length in nucleotides
(nt). The length of siRNA produced by Dicer appears to vary
slightly across organisms (4), so we examine the effect of
siRNA length on off-target error rate. A computational
approach is also able to simulate siRNA lengths that do not
occur in vivo, allowing us to assess the tradeoffs between
siRNA lengths and off-target error rates. l is dsRNA length
(nt). As dsRNA can be synthesized and introduced through a
short hairpin experimentally as an alternative to using siRNA
directly, its length determines the number of possible siRNAs
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 6 1837
produced by Dicer. By varying l, we can investigate the
chances of off-target error using different dsRNA lengths.
pos denotes the position of a dsRNA on its target mRNA,
measured in nucleotides from the 50 end of the CDS. Different
segments of sequences on a target gene have varying silencing
efficacies and Dicer has been reported to preferentially cleave
siRNA on its target (26,39). To study whether dsRNA position
has an effect on its potential of off-targeting, we examine
dsRNAs out of different positions from their target gene.
m is the mismatch length in nucleotides. Experiments have
shown that RNAi works despite the existence of mismatches
between the siRNA and its target (22,23). To observe the effect
of mismatch on off-target error rate, we use a range of mis-
matches in our computational procedures. mpos is the position
of the mismatch within the siRNA. Differential silencing
efficiency among variable mismatch positions has been repor-
ted in biological experiments, demonstrating mismatches in
certain regions within the siRNA is critical for effective
knockdown (22). We examine the positional effect of mis-
match by changing mpos. In order to control the position of
the mismatch, we only consider contiguous mismatches. They
are also most frequently experimented. u3 and u5 indicate the
inclusion of the 30-UTR and 50-UTR, respectively. It is pos-
sible for an siRNA to bind their targets by matching to their
UTRs (4). We study the effect of UTR on the off-target error
by optionally including them. r indicates the application of
siRNA selection by rational design. siRNA selection using
rational design rules (27) can effectively increase silencing
efficacy and reduce the number of siRNAs used. We invest-
igate the effect of rational design on off-target by optionally
applying these rules. Figure 1 and Table 1 illustrate these
parameters. The average off-target error represents the chance
that siRNAs from a dsRNA of a gene will cross-hit some other
genes. When we know the average error E(Q) for a particular
combination of parameter Q, we can find Z(Q), the average
number of genes that will be targeted incorrectly by targeting
each gene
Z Qð Þ ¼ E Qð Þ
1E Qð Þ : 8
The parameters in Equation 7 are based on the RNAi experi-
ments but extended to include much wider ranges. This
extension will facilitate our quantitative study. The calcula-
tions of Equation 6 are conducted through searches in the
inverted file and can be performed in O(Dlog F) time.
An algorithm for detecting siRNA-target binding
allowing mismatches
Experiments have shown that RNAi works despite the exist-
ence of a number of mismatched nucleotides between the
siRNA and its target gene (22,23). However, the efficacy
changes with the length of the mismatch and the position of
the mismatch on the siRNA. Several algorithms have been
developed for string mismatching, a problem that relates to
siRNA-target similarity. Leslie et al. (36) used a trie to con-
struct a mismatch tree for computing their mismatch string
kernels applied in a support vector machine classifier to detect
protein families. Suffix trees were used as data structures to
predict putative RNAi (40). Amir et al. (41) have developed an
algorithm for single mismatch string searches (m = 1), which is
not enough for our study. BLAST (25) also allows for mis-
match by using substitutions based on alignment cost. How-
ever, the related mismatch algorithms are not particularly
developed for RNAi and cannot control the positions of the
mismatch as required in computational models for RNAi.
We define mismatch feature map as follows.
For an n-mer a from an alphabet A, define its mismatch
neighborhood Nmism‚ p að Þ as all n-mer g from A that differ from
a by at most m mismatches starting at position p in a and
ending at position p + m  1 in a and Fmism‚ p að Þ ¼ ½fg að Þg2An ,
where fg að Þ ¼ 1 if g 2 Nmism‚ p að Þ and fg að Þ ¼ 0, otherwise. The
feature map of a gene gx is defined as the sum of the feature
maps of its n-mers
Fmism‚ p gxð Þ ¼
X
a2gx
Fmism‚ p að Þ: 9
The mismatch kernel is computed by replacing the exact
feature map in Equation 2 by the above mismatch feature
map. To compute the average error in Equation 6 with a
mismatch of m nucleotides long, a straightforward search
would require 4m exact match searches, and takes a time of
Tsf ¼ O 4mDlog Fð Þ. If each exact match search needs 30 min,
then a 3-nt mismatch search would need 32 h. To improve
computational performance, we developed a novel flexible and
efficient algorithm for the mismatch searches in RNAi that
allows for arbitrary length of the mismatch and arbitrary
positions of the mismatch in the middle of an siRNA. Our
algorithm manipulates reverse sequences [as by Amir et al.
(41)] but uses different data structures and search strategies.
This algorithm is more computationally efficient than the
mismatch tree algorithm proposed by Leslie et al. (36) with
respect to time and space usage.
We first introduce some notations. Let S ¼ fs1‚s2‚ . . . ‚sNg
be a set of strings of length k from an alphabet A. Suppose
string si ¼ a1a2    ak, where aj 2 A, 1 < j < k, has reverse
string si ¼ akak1    a1. We next define mirrored tree and
leading range used in our algorithms.
DEFINITION. A mirrored tree of a binary search tree (BST)
populated with strings from S is the BST populated with
reverse strings s1, s2, . . . , sN. A u leading range of a string
s from S searched in a BST is the set of nodes returned by a
search that only matches the beginning u letters of s.
The mismatch kernel corresponding to Equation 9 can be
computed by the mirrored tree search (MTS) in Algorithm 1.
We omit its correctness proof owing to space limitation.

At Steps 5 and 6, the substring before the mismatch is exact-
matched in T1 and the leading range is stored in R1, the
substring after the mismatch is exact-matched in T2 and
the leading range is stored in R2. The genes corresponding
to the mismatch letters are sandwiched in C at Step 7 by the
intersection based on gene names and positions of the n-mers.
At Step 9, Ei is computed using the definition based on Ci.
Let the size of the inverted file be F and the total number
of n-grams from all the dsRNAs be D. MTS has a cost of
Tmt ¼ O D 2 log F þ Cð Þð Þ, where O 2 log Fð Þ is the search time
in the two RBTs and C is the cost of obtaining the leading
ranges and the intersection. Using proper join algorithms C
can be bounded by O jR1 j þ jR2 jð Þ (42). Empirically, C is
small and treated as a constant. The mismatch tree algorithm
(36) has a complexity of O DLnm4mð Þ, where L is the average
length of genes. Since usually F < 108 and log F < 30, MTS is
much faster. MTS’s speed-up over the straightforward method
is roughly Sp  O 4mð Þ. Empirical results demonstrated that
MTS achieved speed-ups of two-orders of magnitude on
average for the three organisms. However, it uses more
space because of the mirrored tree.
Simulating positional effect of mismatches
Experiments suggested that nucleotides in the region of 2–9 nt
at the 50 end of the guide strand are crucial for gene silencing
(22,43). It therefore seems that transcripts containing sequence
identity within this critical binding region would have a higher
probability of being targeted for silencing and that mismatches
within this region would have a more significant effect on
reducing off-target silencing. To see this positional effect of
mismatch, we use a weighted scheme where we assign lower
silencing efficiency scores if the mismatches are in the critical
binding region, and higher scores if the mismatches are outside
of the region. The silencing efficiency score for silencing a
gene is the sum of all the scores contributed by each siRNA.
A gene is considered silenced only when its total efficiency
score is above a threshold. We use contiguous mismatches to
control their positions.
Distribution of redundant siRNA sequences in the
transcriptome
A coincidental high frequency of particular 21mer target
sequences within a transcriptome would increase the probab-
ility for off-target effects of any given siRNA sequences. The
transcriptome of each organism tested was described as a
collection of all possible 21mer sequences contained within
and frequency of each sequence was determined. Web utilities
were made available so that the frequencies of siRNAs of a
particular sequence and genes targeted by the sequence can be
retrieved, for the benefit of siRNA design.
Effect of dsRNA position
Frequently, dsRNA (of various lengths) is used to affect RNAi
experimentally. Success was obtained with dsRNA sequences
from various locations within the full-length CDS of targeted
genes. The position of dsRNA along the target sequence was
investigated as a parameter for off-target effects. Beginning
with the first nucleotide of the coding region of a gene, the start
position of dsRNA was incremented 6 nt (two codons) until
position 600 (on average, the final dsRNA closely approached
the end of the CDS). The off-target error (based on exact
sequence identity) was determined for such dsRNA for all
CDSs in the transcriptome.
Off-target error distributions in chromosomes
The physical distribution of genes on chromosomes is not
uniform. Often more genes are located in the middle of a
chromosome than in the ends. The chance for off-target errors,
based on exact sequence identity, for each gene was plotted
against its coordinates on the genetic map of C.elegans. The
curves were smoothed by averaging the error of a gene with
that of its neighbors.
Implementation of rational siRNA design
Different siRNAs from the same target gene have highly
variable efficacy (27,43). Several biological and thermo-
dynamical properties have been identified to characterize
siRNA sequences that mediate especially efficient RNAi
knockdown (27,34,35,43,44). This has led to a set of rules
for ‘rational design’ to optimize siRNA development (27).
All possible siRNA sequences of each of the organisms stud-
ied were scored by the eight criteria of rational design. The
length of siRNA sequences analyzed ranged from 17 to 29 nt
(odd numbers only). The off-target error (based on exact
sequence identity only) was determined for the highest scoring
siRNAs from each gene (in pools of 5, 10 and 20 sequences) to
evaluate whether rational design may reduce off-target errors.
RESULTS
Off-target error based on siRNA sequence identity
versus the transcriptome
The comparison of siRNA sequences with an arbitrary range
of lengths (from 17 to 29 nt) derived from particular dsRNA
sequences against all possible targets on a genome-wide scale
disclosed that the length of siRNA sequences is an important
parameter for determining off-target effects as defined by
sequence identity with other than the intended target sequence
for all three organisms tested. Only CDSs were used as target
sequences. The chance for off-target errors decreased with
increasing lengths of siRNA. siRNA of 21 nt proved optimal,
the chance for off-target effects with this length was signific-
antly lower than for shorter siRNA sequences whereas it did
not differ significantly from that of longer siRNAs (Figure 2).
The off-target effects increased when longer dsRNA
sequences (from 100 up to 400 nt) were used to generate
the pool of siRNA. The sequence diversity inherent to
dsRNA increases with length, leading to a more diverse
pool of siRNA sequences. However, the optimal length for
siRNA remained at 21 nt. When siRNAs are short, longer
dsRNAs generate larger off-target errors. When siRNAs are
relatively long, longer dsRNAs cause slight increase in the
error. However, the effect of dsRNA length is more drastic in
larger genomes (such as H.sapiens, Figure 2A) than in smaller
genomes (as in S.pombe, Figure 2C). Overall, the larger gen-
omes had higher chances of off-target error involving other
genes than the small genomes (S.pombe), as compared in
Figure 2D. In the case of RNAi in H.sapiens, an off-target

Equation 8.

Effects of length and position of mismatches
Allowing sequence mismatch of up to nine contiguous
nucleotides between siRNA and its target sequences increased
the off-target error (Figure 3). As shown, off-target error
increased dramatically with longer mismatches.
Using the weighted scheme for simulating the positional
effect of mismatches, we found that off-target error rates
corresponding to mismatches within the critical binding
region (2–9 nt at the 50 end of the guide strand) were signific-
antly lower, whereas the error rates corresponding to mis-
matches outside this region were much higher, consistent
with the findings in the literature (22,23,43). Figure 4 shows
the positional effect of mismatches in C.elegans, S.pombe and
human genomes, for the cases of n = 21, l = 100, m = 3 and
mpos = 1–19. As shown in this figure, the off-target errors with
mismatches in the critical binding region are significantly
lower, with P-values close to zero for the three organisms.
In the case of C.elegans, for example, the average off-target
error with mismatches in the critical binding region was 10.2%,
whereas the average error with mismatches outside the region
was 15.8%, with a standard deviation of 0.41% and P-value0.
Effects of UTRs
Incorporation of available (not for S.pombe) UTR sequence
data considerably increased the size and diversity of the
target sequences for H.sapiens and C.elegans. The 30-UTR
sequences described for human transcripts when added to
the inverted file containing the CDSs, increased the RBT
by 58%, and the number of leave nodes grew from 41.4 million
to 65.5 million. The use of exact sequence identity as para-
meter while analyzing siRNA of various lengths, derived from
different lengths of dsRNA representing CDS target sequences
only, showed only non-significant increase in off-target errors
of RNAi in the case of H.sapiens and C.elegans (Figure 5). For
example in H.sapiens, the average error over siRNA length
from 17 to 28 is
P28
n¼17 E l ¼ 200‚u3 ¼ 0‚nð Þ=12 ¼ 0:340,
when l = 200 and 30-UTR sequences were not considered;
whereas inclusion of 30-UTR yielded an average error ofP28
n¼17 E l ¼ 200‚u3 ¼ 1‚nð Þ=12 ¼ 0:353. These average
errors are not significantly different (P-value = 0.81).

different from longer siRNAs. Increased length of dsRNA yielded more diverse pools of siRNA, resulting in increased chance for off-target errors.

Frequency of specific 21mer sequences in different
transcriptomes
The sequence data of the transcriptome of each of the three
organisms studied were computationally scanned for the
occurrence of all possible 21mer sequences representing
siRNA, derived from the same transcriptome. Particular
sequences were present at distinctly different frequencies
(Figure 6). This indicates that a direct sequence comparison
analysis of potential siRNA sequences versus the transcrip-
tome of specific organisms can identify siRNA designs with
reduced chance for off-target error owing to a low frequency of
potential off-target sequences in the transcriptome. Table 2
displays the proportion of unique siRNAs in the organisms. It
indicates that out of all possible siRNAs in human 83.1% are
unique, in C.elegans 86.6% are unique, and in S.pombe 99%
are unique.
To assist siRNA designers to evaluate off-target errors, we
have made available the frequency count of each siRNA in the
three genomes of H.sapiens, C.elegans and S.pombe on the
Web at http://rnai.cs.unm.edu/rnai/off-target/sirna_freq/. The

that serves as indicators for off-target chances. We also pro-
vide a web tool that searches for the genes targeted by a given
sequence allowing mismatches and different siRNA lengths
(http://rnai.cs.unm.edu/rnai/off-target/genes-targeted/).
Effect of dsRNA position along the target sequence
The incremental variation of the position of the dsRNA (that
served as source for the siRNA) along the target sequence
showed that off-target errors were significantly lower for the
beginning 100 nt positions than for those in the following
positions. Figure 7A shows this position effect for C.elegans
genome for the cases of l = 100, 200 and n = 22. The off-target
error in these two segments were significantly different, P-
value < 103. The same phenomenon is evident for H.sapiens
(Figure 7B) and S.pombe (Figure 7C). However, the differ-
ences are smaller and become insignificant for most of the
parameters for H.sapiens. The initial region of human-derived
CDSs associated with lower off-target error is decreased in
length when the length of the dsRNA was increased.
Off-target error distributions on physical maps of
chromosomes
The chance for off-target errors for each CDS in the transcrip-
tome was mapped onto the physical map of chromosomes
from C.elegans (Figure 8). The physical maps show that
genes are distributed in a rough bell shape around the density
center of each chromosome. The distribution of off-target
errors for RNAi differed considerably; the off-target errors
are low in the gene-dense centers of chromosomes I, II, III
and X. In all the chromosomes except for chromosome I, there

are two high-error regions in the low and high telomeric ends
of chromosomes apart from the centers. In chromosome IV,
the error is high in the density center region, but lower than the
two peaks off the center. In chromosome V, the high off-target
error rate in the central gene-dense region also exceeds the
error rate of two regions that are off the center. The genes in
the coding-dense region of a chromosome did not necessarily
have the highest off-target errors. These error distributions
suggest that genes in the high density regions may use
more unique sequences than in regions sparsely populated
by genes. In chromosomes II, IV and V, the peak off-target
errors were close to 0.5. Thus, based on Equation 8, targeting
each gene in these regions by RNAi is on average associated
with a potential off-target knockdown of one other gene. Thus,
RNAi experiments to knockdown genes in such regions may
consider more additional or even specific controls.

Effect of rational siRNA design
All possible siRNA sequences of various lengths from dsRNA
(l = 300) were selected using rational design parameters to
identify a subset of siRNA sequences that are more likely to
effectively guide RNAi. The off-target error for this subset of
sequences was determined for H.sapiens and C.elegans owing
to their high off-target error rates (Figure 9). This approach
reduced off-target errors substantially. The algorithms used in
this study were easily modified to incorporate the rational
design filter, including only high-scoring siRNAs (score = 6
out of 8) (27) for the off-target error analysis. The average
off-target error of all (non-rational design) siRNAs was
significantly larger (P-value = 0.001) than those of siRNA
sequences selected by rational design. The average off-
target error rates determined using rational design pool of
sizes of 5, 10 and 20 (representing siRNA sequences that
scored highest), and siRNAs selected as scoring 6 or higher
by the rational design filter were not significantly different,
P-value = 0.13. Thus, rational design reduced the off-target
error from 34 to 24% (n = 21, l = 300, H.sapiens, Figure 9A).
Significant reduction of off-target errors was also observed for
C.elegans (Figure 9B).
To understand the relationship of an siRNA’s frequency in
the genome and its efficacy represented by its score of rational
design, we computed the correlation coefficient between the
count and the rational score of each siRNA. These correlation
coefficients are very small, as shown in Table 2, indicating that
the frequency and the rational score are not correlated. This
independence between frequency of an siRNA and its rational
score suggests that the objectives of minimizing off-target
error rates of siRNAs and maximizing their efficacy can be
pursued independently in an siRNA design.
DISCUSSION
This computational study of mechanistic aspects of RNAi
against the background of extensive transcriptome and
genome information available in the nematode C.elegans,
H.sapiens (human) and (to a lesser extent) for S.pombe (fission
yeast), indicated a considerable likelihood that the specificity
of RNAi knockdown is compromised by off-target RNAi
effects. The similarity of observations from organisms of a
wide phylogenetic range (fungi to both protostome and
deuterostome animals) suggests that the conclusions from
our analyses may provide insights into general aspects of
RNAi. The results reported here were derived from computa-
tional approaches only; the feasibility of experimental valida-
tion is compromised by the large (genome-size) scale of the
sequence data considered in these analyses. However, the
parameters used for the computational analyses were applied
at a high stringency compared with the conditions that allow
RNAi in vivo. For instance, only sequence identity and min-
imal mismatch were considered to define siRNA specificity
for a target sequence, bulge or wobble phenomena that relax
sequence-specific target recognition by siRNA (22) were not
allowed for. In addition, with a computational approach it was
feasible to test parameters (such as lengths of dsRNA and
especially siRNA) beyond the naturally occurring ranges to
examine properties and trends of RNAi specificity. Our work
does, however, suggest an empirical investigation that would
be informative about both in vivo off-target rates and the
properties of the siRNA binding/knockdown process. In each
of the organisms studied here, we have identified a number of
siRNA that have the highest potential for off-target effects,
along with the predicted affected genes and predicted efficacy
according to the rational design rules (http://rnai.cs.unm.edu/
rnai/off-target /). An in vivo study of the knockdown produced
by some or all of these siRNAs with regard to the putative
affected genes and controlled by monitoring predicted non-
target genes (measured, e.g. by microarray analysis) could
reveal whether the predicted off-target effects do, in fact,
occur in living systems. The rates of off-target knockdown
would help to calibrate the predicted rates in this paper.
Furthermore, such an experiment would contribute evidence
toward the current debate of whether or not efficacy is purely
a function of the siRNA or is also dependent on the target
molecule (45–47).
The algorithm used to detect sequence similarity as para-
meter for off-target RNAi was designed specifically for use
with short (siRNA) sequences, while it also incorporated the

the center of an siRNA), pool size = 5, 10, 20 and rational filter is also con-
sidered. The selection of siRNA with properties that were empirically found to
be associated with highly functional siRNA sequences reduced off-target error
relative to that of non-filtered siRNA. Note that off-target error is never reduced
to zero.

use of dsRNA as a source for siRNA sequences. Thus, the
analyses are relevant for two ways to experimentally affect
RNAi, introduction of dsRNA and siRNA (18,26). The algo-
rithm is superior to the BLASTN algorithm (25), which is
usually recommended to evaluate potential off-target proper-
ties of siRNA and dsRNA designs toward other genes (26).
While BLAST search offers some protection against off-target
effects, and is certainly better than no control whatsoever, it is
not, by itself, sufficient for general use for at least two reasons.
First, the BLAST homology function was not particularly
developed to model the RNAi-binding process and does not
account for some of its known features. For example, mis-
matches and bulges are known to have differential effects on
efficacy, varying along the length of the siRNA (22,23).
Although BLAST allows for mismatch, insertion and deletion
based on alignment cost, it cannot control the positions of
these imperfect match patterns. Our algorithm is capable of
modeling these patterns by controlling the length and posi-
tions, allowing it to detect off-target effects that would be
missed by BLAST searches. Second, BLAST is suitable
only when the entire genome sequence is available—in the
absence of complete genome information, it is possible that
significant off-target interactions will be missed. Although we
can also only search complete genomes in the current work, we
have quantified expected off-target error rates in a number of
organisms, establishing a range of probable off-target rates. In
an otherwise unsequenced organism, these bounds can be used
to estimate the probability of off-target effects based on com-
parison of its genome size and evolutionary history. They can
also be used to ameliorate such effects through multiple trials
with varying siRNA selected from the target gene. Using off-
target framework built in this work, we are able to develop
quantitative models to predict off-target errors by incorporat-
ing a number of variables such as genome size and chromo-
somal location of a target gene in addition to the parameters we
used in Materials and Methods. These models will provide
reliable prediction of false positive error rates when an organ-
ism is partially sequenced.
We should note that our predictions neither include the
effects of siRNA concentration nor do they attempt to account
for the non-linear (synergistic or mutually interfering) inter-
actions of a pool of siRNA. It is clear that both these effects
are of critical practical consequence and that a computational
model supporting them is desirable. At the moment, however,
there is insufficient published data on the efficacies of pools to
be able to construct a high-confidence model of pool effects.
From some reports (15) it is clear that simplistic models, such
as linear combinations weighted by concentration, are inad-
equate. Thus, the results in this paper do not attempt to model
either concentration or non-linear siRNA pool effects. Our
results should, therefore, be interpreted as the chance that
any single siRNA arising from a chosen dsRNA has a chance
of off-target interaction within the genome. In practice, this
may be an overestimate of true off-target effects, but it does
still provide an indication of off-target genes that should be
monitored for potential off-target repercussions.
Remarkably, the examination of RNAi off-target error as a
function of siRNA length disclosed that siRNA sequences of
21 nt, the length most observed in vivo, optimally balanced
target specificity and low chance of off-target RNAi. siRNA
sequences of <21 nt had increased chance for off-target effects
whereas longer sequences did not gain adequate target speci-
ficity to significantly reduce off-target reactivity. This siRNA
length effect suggests that the chance for off-target RNAi
effects may increase with the use of artificial siRNA sequences
of <21 nt, such as 12–15 nt dsRNA fragments that result
from RNase III digestion of dsRNA (48). The protozoan para-
site Trypanosoma bruci employs comparatively long siRNA
(24–26 nt) to target RNAi (39), perhaps for the benefit of
gaining some critical specificity of RNAi. However, sufficient
sequence data are lacking at this time to validly investigate
the off-target dynamics for siRNA of various lengths in this
organism.
Despite inherent properties that combine optimally for spe-
cific sequence-based recognition, 21 nt siRNA still have a
considerable chance for off-target effects when considering
all coding domains within a transcriptome. Not surprisingly,
the incidence of off-target effects increased when sequence
mismatch of up to nine consecutive residues between the
siRNA and the potential targets was allowed for. Varying
the position of these mismatches within the siRNA sequence
changed the number of potential target sequences. Consistent
with experimental observations (22,23,43), we found that off-
target error rates corresponding to mismatches within the
region of 2–9 nt at the 50 end of the guide strand were signi-
ficantly lower.
The off-target effects also increased following inclusion of
upstream and downstream UTR sequences within the target
sequences, to reflect the in vivo reality that complete mRNA
transcripts (not just the protein-encoding sequences) can be
attacked by RNAi. Although this increase was not significant
(Figure 5), this result suggests that the nucleotide usage in
UTRs substantially differs from that in coding regions. Finally,
off-target errors increased when using longer versus shorter
lengths of dsRNA to generate the siRNA population.
Intriguingly, our methods showed that dsRNA representing
the region of the first 100 nt of the 50 terminus of CDSs yielded
the lowest chances for off-target effects. This particular region
may differ between genes for proteins that function intracel-
lular versus proteins that are released extracellularly. The 50
sequence of the latter category of genes encodes for signal
peptides or membrane anchors. The specific sequence con-
straints that ensure functionality of these domains (49), may
subdivide the transcriptome into smaller populations of target
sequences. Although the beginning of the CDS has lower off-
target error, this region is not recommended for dsRNA design
because it is rich in regulatory protein-binding sites (26).
There is also an empirical evidence that Dicer produces
more siRNA toward the 30 portion of the target gene
(39,50). In all, the reduction in off-target error was not signi-
ficantly different for dsRNA from the first 100 nt versus
dsRNA representing residues 100–200 nt of CDSs.
Combined, the above computational findings suggest an
extensive potential for off-target effect of RNAi experiments.
However, in practice, chances for off-target errors may be less
severe. RNAi targets mRNA for destruction and can only
knock down genes that are expressed when siRNA is present.
Potential off-target genes (that have adequate sequence iden-
tity to siRNA) will not be affected if they are not expressed
simultaneously with the intended target gene. Our analysis
showed that relatively few siRNA targets a sequence that is
repeated frequently throughout the transcriptome of each of
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 6 1845
the organisms tested. In fact, siRNA designs can be screened
for this property (http://rnai.cs.unm.edu/rnai/off-target/) to
avoid the use of siRNA with increased chance for off-target
errors. Moreover, we determined the chance for off-target
error for each gene within the transcriptome of C.elegans
relative to its position on the physical map of the genome
of this nematode. CDSs from chromosome regions that contain
more densely packed genes had a lower probability for off-
target RNAi, as observed in all chromosomes except chromo-
somes IV and V. This implied that densely packed genes
generally employ more unique sequences within the genome
of C.elegans. Regardless, once a physical map is available for
an organism, it may be possible to correlate the need to con-
sider RNAi off-target error for a particular gene with the
location of that gene within the genome. In addition, the results
of the combined analysis suggest a trend where the chance for
the off-target error is elevated for larger genomes. Of note,
C.elegans and H.sapiens have roughly the same proportions of
unique siRNAs (Table 2), but the off-target error rate in
H.sapiens was much higher (Figure 2D). Sequence compar-
ison showed that transposable elements may not be the source
of these frequent 21mers, and the true origin remained to be
determined.
Finally, several properties of siRNA sequences have been
found to be associated with a high efficacy to cause RNAi.
For instance, the relative thermodynamical stability of the
sequence termini may determine how a double-stranded siRNA
dissociates to correctly incorporate the negative RNA strand into
the RISC complex (43). Such properties have been combined
into rational design methods for improving the siRNA efficacy
(43). Implementation of rational design yielded a considerable
reduction in the number of functional siRNA sequences derived
from the transcriptomes of H.sapiens and C.elegans, thereby
reduced likelihood for off-target error. Statistical analysis
showed that minimizing off-target error and enhancing
siRNA efficacy can be performed independently.
In summary, experimental RNAi targeted by siRNA has a
certain degree of specificity. However, off-target effects yield-
ing unintentional knockdown of unrelated genes are probable.
The random occurrence of some level of sequence identity
(including imperfect match) between siRNA and multiple
targets in a transcriptome contributes to this undesired effect.
The computational methods applied here may underestimate
the off-target effects because of fairly stringent matching of
sequence identity. Further studies will consider more relaxed
rules for siRNA–target interaction such as bulge and wobble
effects that occur in vivo. Although off-target effects can be
reduced by minimizing sequence similarity with known tran-
scripts and by rational design, it is recommended to include
controls for specific targeting in RNAi experiments. Further
understanding of siRNA will lead to more precise targeting of
RNAi and reduce off-target effect to benefit the study of gene
function and other future applications of RNAi.
