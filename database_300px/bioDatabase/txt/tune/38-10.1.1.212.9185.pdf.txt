Abstract
Genome-wide copy number changes were analyzed in 70
primary human lung carcinoma specimens and 31 cell lines
derived from human lung carcinomas, with high-density
arrays representingf115,000 single nucleotide polymorphism
loci. In addition to previously characterized loci, two regions
of homozygous deletion were found, one near the PTPRD
locus on chromosome segment 9p23 in four samples repre-
senting both small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non–small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and the second on chromosome
segment 3q25 in one sample each of NSCLC and SCLC. High-
level amplifications were identified within chromosome
segment 8q12-13 in two SCLC specimens, 12p11 in two NSCLC
specimens and 22q11 in four NSCLC specimens. Systematic
copy number analysis of tyrosine kinase genes identified high-
level amplification of EGFR in three NSCLC specimens, FGFR1
in two specimens and ERBB2 and MET in one specimen each.
EGFR amplification was shown to be independent of kinase
domain mutational status. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(13): 5561-70)
Introduction
Mapping copy number alterations in the cancer genome has
contributed to the subsequent identification of tumor suppressor
genes and oncogenes. The delineation of cancer-specific homozy-
gous deletions enabled the discovery of several different tumor
suppressor genes, including RB1 (1), CDKN2A (2, 3), PTEN (4, 5),
and SMAD4/DPC4 (6). Similarly, genes that are targets for high-level
amplification in cancers are likewise often subject to oncogenic
mutations. Examples where identification of cancer-specific
amplifications preceded the identification of cancer somatic
mutations include PDGFRA (7, 8), EGFR (9–14), ERBB2 (15, 16),
and PIK3CA (17–19).
High-resolution genomic approaches now make it possible to
screen for chromosomal copy number alterations in a systematic
manner. Array comparative genomic hybridization can provide
high-resolution detection of copy number changes (20, 21). Single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays can measure cancer-specific
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with high accuracy in a genome-wide
fashion (22–26). Furthermore, SNP arrays that cover f10,000 SNP
loci can be used to detect DNA copy number changes at the
genome level, including high-level amplifications and homozygous
deletions (27, 28).
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world
and is estimated to result in f160,000 deaths annually in the
United States alone (29). Genomic studies have begun to impact
the diagnosis and treatment of human lung carcinoma. For
example, mutations in the EGFR kinase domain in non–small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) specimens were found to correlate with
patient responses to gefitinib and erlotinib (11–13).
To discover novel genomic changes in human lung carcinomas,
in the hopes of identifying additional pathways active in these
diseases, we have used SNP arrays covering f115,000 SNP loci to
investigate copy number changes in a panel of DNA from 77
NSCLC and 24 small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) lung cell lines and
primary tumors. Given the high resolution of the SNP arrays, we
have been able to identify several small homozygous deletions and
amplifications that have not been detected by previous methods.
Materials and Methods
Primary tumor and cell line specimens. We obtained the following
genomic DNA: lung adenocarcinoma (HOP-62, NCI-H23), large cell lung
carcinoma (LC; HOP-92), and squamous cell lung carcinoma (NCI-H266)
from the National Cancer Institute. We prepared genomic DNA from the
following cell lines: adenocarcinoma (H1437, H1819, H1993, H2009, H2087,
H2122, H2347, HCC193, HCC461, HCC515, HCC78, HCC827), adenosqu-
amous lung carcinoma (HCC366), LC (H2126, HCC1359, HCC1171),
unspecified NSCLC (H2882, H2887), squamous cell lung carcinoma (H157,
HCC15, HCC95), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC; H358), and SCLC
(H524, H526, H1184, H1607, H1963). The primary tumors were from
anonymous patients and were surgically dissected and frozen at 80jC
until use. All primary tumor specimens were examined histologically to
ensure at least 70% neoplastic tissue, except SCLC samples that were
considered to have high tumor contents. These tumors consisted of 19
SCLC and 51 NSCLC. These include SCLC (S0168T, S0169T, S0170T, S0171T,
S0172T, S0173T, S0177T, S0185T, S0187T, S0188T, S0189T, S0190T, S0191T,
S0192T, S0193T, S0194T, S0196T, S0198T, S0199T), lung adenocarcinoma

Single nucleotide polymorphism array. For each sample, SNPs were
genotyped with two different arrays, CentXba and CentHind, in parallel
(Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Array experiments were done according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. In brief, two aliquots of DNA
(250 ng each) were first digested with XbaI or HindIII restriction enzyme
(New England Biolabs, Boston, MA), respectively. The digested DNA was
ligated to an adaptor before subsequent PCR amplification using AmpliTaq
Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Four 100 AL PCR reactions were
then set up for each XbaI or HindIII adaptor-ligated DNA sample. The PCR
products from four reactions were pooled, concentrated, and fragmented
with DNase I to a size range of 250 to 2,000 bp. Fragmented PCR products
were then labeled, denatured, and hybridized to the array. After
hybridization, the arrays were washed on the Affymetrix fluidics stations,
stained, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000 and the genotyping
software, Affymetrix Genotyping Tools Version 2.0.
Data analysis. Data were normalized to a baseline array with median
signal intensity at the probe intensity level with the invariant set
normalization method described by Li and Wong (30). After normalization,
the signal values for each SNP in each array were obtained with a model-
based (PM/MM) method (31). Signal intensities at each probe locus were
compared with a set of normal reference samples representing 12
individuals. From raw signal data, the inferred copy numbers at each SNP
locus was estimated by applying the hidden Markov model (HMM; ref. 27).
We applied the HMM model based on the assumption of diploidy or
triploidy; thus, possible normalized copy numbers are (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .;
diploid) or (0, 0.67, 1.33, 2, 2.67, 3.33, 4, . . .; triploid), leading to the possible
copy number set (0, 0.67, 1, 1.33, 2, 2.67, 3, 3.33, 4, . . .). The analysis methods
described above are implemented in the dChip software Version 1.3, which
is freely available to academic users (http://biosun1.harvard.edu/~cli/
dchip2004.exe). Mapping information of SNP locations and cytogenetic
band are based on curation of Affymetrix and University of California Santa
Cruz hg 16 (http://genome.ucsc.edu).
We applied the circular binary segmentation algorithm (32) to our raw
log2 ratio data. This algorithm recursively splits chromosomes into
subsegments based on a maximum t statistic. The reference distribution
for this statistic, estimated by permutation, is used to decide whether or not
to split at each stage (see ref. 32 for details). We compared the (rounded)
mean raw estimated copy for each segment to our HMM results.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Relative gene copy numbers and gene
expression were determined by quantitative real-time PCR using a PRISM
7500 sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and a QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR kit and a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Inc.,
Valencia, CA). The standard curve method was used to calculate target gene
copy number in the tumor DNA sample normalized to a repetitive element
Line-1 and normal reference DNA. The comparative threshold cycle method
was used to calculate gene expression normalized to b-actin as a gene
reference and normal human lung RNA as an RNA reference. Primers
were designed using Primer 3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/
primer3_www.cgi) and synthesized by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Primer
sequences are available upon request.
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) probes were made from BAC clones RP11-805B16 and
RP11-153K21 (Children’s Hospital, Oakland Research Institute, Oakland,
CA), identified to overlap the ASPH locus. BAC DNA was purified and 100 ng
of each clone was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP using random primers.
The DNA was then purified with a MicroSpin S-200 HR column, ethanol
precipitated, and resuspended in 100 AL hybridization solution. The control
FISH probe, CEP 8 SpectrumOrange (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL), detects the
centromeric region of chromosome 8. H2171 cells were grown in culture
using standard methods and harvested by centrifugation after 3 days of
growth. Slides for FISH analysis were prepared according to the control
probe manufacturer’s directions (Vysis). Briefly, cell pellets were resus-
pended in a fixative, a 3:1 solution of methanol and acetic acid. The cell
suspension was dropped onto slides dipped in fixative and dried for 10
minutes over a 67jC water bath. The slides were pretreated with 2 SSC at
37jC for 1 hour, then digested for 5 minutes with a 1:25 solution of All III
and rinsed with PBS. They were then incubated for 1 minute in 10%
buffered formalin at room temperature, rinsed with PBS, dehydrated in an
ethanol series (70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%), and air dried. Ten microliters of
probe solution (6 AL hybridization buffer, 1 AL Cot-1 DNA, 1 AL centromere
control probe, and 1 AL each of RP11-805B16 and RP11-153K21 probes)
were incubated on the slide under a sealed coverslip for 3.5 minutes at 85jC
and then placed in a humidified chamber overnight at 37jC. The slides were
then washed in 0.5 SSC at 75jC for 5 minutes. The ASPH probes were
detected using a 1:500 dilution of FITC antidigoxigenin in 10% normal goat
serum, with 4V,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as a counterstain.
Results
Genome-wide analysis of lung cancer. One hundred one
human lung carcinoma DNA samples, including 51 NSCLC primary
tumor samples, 26 NSCLC cell line samples, 19 SCLC primary
tumor samples, and 5 SCLC cell line samples, were hybridized to
SNP arrays containing 115,593 mapped SNP loci. Two independent
algorithms, the HMM in dChipSNP (27) and binary segmentation
analysis (32), were used to infer copy number and thereby to
identify genomic amplifications and deletions.
The genomes of lung carcinomas are often complex with nume-
rous chromosomal alterations. For example, the lung adenocarci-
noma cell line H2122 shows homozygous deletions on chromosome
arms 2q, 8q, and 9p, and a significant amplification on chromosome
arm 8q (Fig. 1A). Analyses of all tumor samples, throughout the
genome, identifies recurrent regions of copy number gain and loss
in lung carcinomas (Fig. 1B and C ; Supplementary Fig. S1 shows
copy number estimates for each sample across the entire genome).
In both NSCLC and SCLC, the most frequent copy number gains
were found in chromosome arm 5p, with z3 copies found in 25%
and 43% of samples, respectively (Fig. 1B and C). However, the
region of 5p copy number gain is usually large, and we were not
able to identify any area of focal amplification from our data set.
Maximum degrees of copy number loss at a given locus, with an
inferred copy number <1.5 based on HMM analysis, were found
most often in chromosome arms 8p (33%) and 9p (26%) in NSCLC
(Fig. 1B) and in chromosome arms 3p (68%) and 4q (58%) in SCLC
(Fig. 1C). These findings are broadly similar to results reported by
CGH (33); however, overall, we are reporting a somewhat lower
frequency of these chromosome alterations. Possible reasons
include the following: (a) the presence of stromal admixture in
primary tumor samples; (b) copy number signal is attenuated
either at the level of primary hybridization intensity or due to the
application of the HMM; or (c) we are analyzing maximal regions of
loss rather than tallying the presence of loss at any site within a
whole chromosome arm. For example, the SCLC cell lines NCI-
H524 and NCI-H526 only show partial loss of chromosome 3p in
SNP array analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1); similar results are seen
for the same cell lines upon analysis with cDNA array CGH.15 The
large regions of modest copy gain and loss shown in Fig. 1B and C
do not determine the presence or absence of alterations in specific
genes within these regions.
Homozygous deletions and amplifications are of particular
interest because they may indicate tumor suppressor gene and
oncogene loci, respectively. Regions of homozygous deletion were

defined as segments of at least four SNP loci covering >5 kb with an
inferred copy number of 0 by HMM. Similarly, regions of high-level
amplification were defined as segments at least four SNP loci
covering >5 kb with an inferred copy number z7.
Copy number alterations that recurred in multiple samples were
verified by real-time PCR (Table 1). In general, copy number esti-
mation was consistent between the HMM and binary segmentation
approaches. Note that whereas quantitative real-time PCR results

have been highly reproducible between duplicate experiments, the
copy number increases detected by the arrays seem to saturate at a
much lower level. Thus, an inferred copy number of f7 may
correspond to a quantitative PCR copy number of as high as 175 or
as low as 9 (MYC amplification; Table 1).
On average, the number of annotated genes is greater for regions
of recurrent, high-level amplification (copy number z7) than for
recurrent homozygously deleted regions (14.6 versus 7.7 genes/Mb,
respectively). Given the parameters used in these experiments, the
HMM algorithm was able to identify several amplified regions that
were not found by binary segmentation but were verified by real-
time PCR analysis. (All homozygous deletions and high-level
amplifications identified in this study are shown in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, respectively).
The frequencies of high-level amplification (copy number z7)
and homozygous deletion (copy number = 0) across the genome in
NSCLC and SCLC are displayed in Fig. 1D . Note that gene names
shown are merely representative of the locus. They do not imply
that the indicated gene is the only or key target of chromosomal
alteration or that it is involved in cancer pathogenesis.
Six distinct recurrent homozygous deletions were identified
(Table 1; Fig. 1D , blue bars below the line). The most common
homozygously deleted locus (7 of 26 NSCLC lines) includes the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene, CDKN2A , on chromosome
9p21, well-known to be deleted in NSCLC. Other deletions
comprise the phosphatase and tensin homologue PTEN tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 10q23, in 1 of 5 SCLC lines and
2 of 19 primary tumors, and the FHIT gene on chromosome 3p,
also primarily in SCLC. A homozygous deletion of chromosome
2q22.1 was found in 4 of 26 NSCLC cell lines (Table 1). Each of
these four deletions fall within a single known gene, the low-
density lipoprotein-related protein 1B gene (LRP1B), but in no case
is the entire LRP1B gene deleted; it is unknown whether LRP1B or
some undescribed transcript is the target of these deletions.
Homozygous deletions in LRP1B have previously been identified in
f17% of NSCLC cell lines (34). Interestingly, every cell line with
interstitial LRP1B deletion also has undergone complete deletion
of CDKN2A (Table 1). Finally, we identified two recurrent
homozygous deletions on chromosome segments 3q25 and 9p23
(see below).
Genes within loci that most frequently undergo copy number
gain (copy number z4) include the Myc family members MYC,
MYCL1 , and MYCN (35–37); regions encompassing the EGFR (38),
FGFR1 , and CDK4 (39) kinase genes and the CCNE1 cyclin gene;
and the PIK3CA gene (18). All of these amplifications have been
previously reported in lung carcinoma except the loci containing
FGFR1 and CCNE1 , which have been reported in other tumor types
(40–44).
The 8q12-13 locus, where we recently identified amplification
(27), is amplified in a second SCLC sample in this study. We have
also identified two novel amplicons on chromosome 12p11 and
22q11.
Homozygous deletions within chromosome segments 3q25
and 9p23. There were two recurrent regions of homozygous
deletion within our data set that had not been previously reported,
on chromosome segments 3q25 and 9p23. Homozygous deletions
within 3q25 were found in two samples, the H2882 NSCLC cell line
and the S0177T primary SCLC tumor, by array analysis and
quantitative PCR (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2A). This 120 kb
region includes only two annotated genes, AADAC and SUCNR1 .
AADAC encodes arylacetamide deacetylase, which is predicted to
catalyze biotransformation pathways for arylamine and heterocy-
clic amine carcinogens. SUCNR1 is a G-protein–coupled receptor
for the citric acid cycle intermediate, succinate, and may be
involved in succinate-induced hypertension (45).
Chromosome 9p undergoes frequent LOH in lung and other
cancers, typically associated with homozygous deletion or other
inactivation of CDKN2A . Our data have identified an additional
region of homozygous deletion on chromosome 9p23-24.1,
telomeric to CDKN2A, which includes sequence upstream of and
in the 5V-most portion of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, recep-
tor type, D (PTPRD) gene (Fig. 2A and B ; Table 1). One SCLC
primary tumor, S0177T, and one NSCLC cell line, H358, contain
homozygous deletions confirmed by real-time PCR upstream of
PTPRD and in the 5V untranslated region, exon 1, and intron 1 of
this gene (Fig. 2C). Two additional cell lines, H2347 and HCC1171,
as well as H358, also contain homozygous deletions further
upstream of the PTPRD coding region and more centromeric on
chromosome 9 (Fig. 2C ; Table 1). Whereas not all of the deletions
remove exons of PTPRD , all of the homozygous deletions eliminate
exons from an uncharacterized spliced transcript whose sequence
and exonic structure are conserved between human and mouse
(BC028038; corresponds to the position f8.52 to 10.60 Mb on
human chromosome 9). This transcript contains a unique 5V end,
several central exons shared with PTPRD , and a unique 3V end. An
alignment of PTPRD , BC028038 , and the similar mouse transcript
is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. No role for PTPRD or the
BC028038 transcript has been described as yet in lung tumorigen-
esis; we seek to determine the frequency of alterations in these
genes in lung cancer by further SNP array analysis, by quantitative
PCR, and by sequencing.
8q amplification in small cell lung carcinoma. A high-level
amplicon of chromosome 8q12.1-q13.11, 1.7 to 2.6 Mb in size in the
SCLC cell line H2171, was identified in our previous study using
SNP arrays representing f10,000 SNP loci (27). Interphase FISH
analysis on the H2171 line confirmed the amplification of the
8q12-13 locus, with an estimated copy number of at least 12 to 20
(Fig. 3A). In this study, SNP array analysis of one SCLC primary
tumor sample, S0177T, revealed high-level amplification of the
8q12-13 region near the ASPH locus (Fig. 3B). Quantitative real-
time PCR revealed a copy number of 89.9, a 45-fold increase over
normal genomic DNA. SNP array analysis revealed lower level copy
number gains (z4) of the 8q12-13 region in additional SCLC
primary tumors, which were verified by quantitative real-time PCR
(Fig. 3C) and in 3 of 22 NSCLC cell lines (not shown).
Whereas we have identified other novel regions of chromosome
amplification at similar frequencies, this 8q12-13 region is of
interest because of the small number of genes involved. The
primary SCLC tumor sample, S0177T, contains an amplicon of 670
to 750 kb in size that does not contain the entire ASPH gene, but
does include its catalytic domain and one additional open reading
frame, MGC34646 , encoding a protein containing a Sec14p-like
lipid-binding domain (Fig. 3D). Real-time reverse transcription-
PCR (RT-PCR) analysis showed the relative expression of ASPH
was 12-fold higher in H2171 cell line than in normal lung.
Quantitative PCR analysis of MGC34646 expression revealed it to
be >100-fold higher in H2171 than in control SCLC cell lines that
do not have 8q12-13 amplification (not shown); MGC34646
expression was not detectable from normal lung tissue. These
data suggest but do not prove that MGC34646 may be a target of
chromosomal amplification resulting in significantly increased
gene expression.

Recurrent amplification on 12p11 and 22q11 in non–small
cell lung carcinoma. Amplification of 12p11 was found in two
NSCLC samples (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2B), with an
overlapping region from 32.7 to 33 Mb. The minimally amplified
region contains four genes, LOC283343 , a pseudogene similar to
argininosuccinate synthetase, and CGI-04 , a provisional protein
coding gene, as well as DNM1L and PKP2 . DNM1L encodes
dynamin like protein 1, which is a member of the dynamin family
of GTPases, involved in the fission of organelles, such as
mitochondria and peroxisomes (46, 47). PKP2 encodes plakaphilin
2, which may be involved in h-catenin signaling (48).
High-level amplification of chromosome segment 22q11 was
found in two adenocarcinoma cell lines, HCC515 and H1819, one
primary adenocarcinoma tumor, S0380T, and one large cell
carcinoma cell line, HCC1359, and confirmed by quantitative
PCR (Table 1), with a minimal region of overlap from 19.45 to 20.31
Mb (Supplementary Table S3). Examples from the HCC515 cell line
and S0380T primary tumor are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2C .
High-level amplification on 22q11 has not been previously
described in lung cancer. Although we have not yet identified the
target gene within the 22q11 amplicon, genes of interest that map
to this region include CRKL and PIK4CA . CRKL is a member of
the CRK adapter protein family, which include homologues of the
v-CRK oncogene (49). PIK4CA is the catalytic subunit of
phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase a, which is responsible for the
downstream production of certain cell signaling molecules. Real-
time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of cell line–derived mRNA
showed the relative expression of CRKL in cells with 22q11
amplification to be higher (5.32-fold in HCC515 and 3.75-fold in
HCC1359) than PIK4CA expression (2.61-fold in HCC515 and to be
0.4-fold higher in HCC1359), compared with both normal human
lung and lung cancer lines without 22q11 amplification. However,
a significant increase in CRKL protein expression was not found in
cell lines containing the amplicon (data not shown). Thus, the
target of the amplification remains unknown.
Copy number aberrations in the CDK4/CDK6 pathway in
non–small cell lung carcinoma. The RB/p16/CDK4/CDK6 path-
way is often disrupted in tumorigenesis. Copy number alterations
of CCND1, CDK4, CDK6, p16, RB1 , as well as CCNE1 , were present in
our data and were for the most part nonoverlapping, as expected
with genes in a pathway. However, clear target genes have yet to be
identified, as these regions with copy number alterations contain
several genes in addition to these candidate ones. The CDK2NA
locus on chromosome 9p21 is frequently subject to homozygous
deletion in NSCLC (50) as in many other cancers. Seven NSCLC cell
lines in this study were found to undergo loss of both copies of the
CDKN2A locus (Table 1), confirming frequent deletion of this
region; we suspect that there were also primary tumors with
homozygous deletion but cannot confirm this finding in the face of
stromal admixture.
Cyclin D1 (CCND1) amplification and overexpression has been
previously described in NSCLC (51). The region containing the
cyclin D1 gene CCND1 was amplified in five NSCLC cell lines
(Supplementary Table S3). High-level amplification (3- to 4-fold) of
the region surrounding the cyclin E (CCNE1) gene (19q12) was also
present in two primary tumor samples, one SCLC and one
adenocarcinoma (Table 1). High-level amplification on chromosome
12q13-12q14, encompassing the CDK4 locus, was found in two
samples (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2B, left ). High-level
amplification of this region has recently been reported in lung

cancer (39). The amplified region contains from 20 to 34 genes,
among which CDK4 is an intriguing candidate oncogene (Supple-
mentary Table S3). Two- to three-fold amplification of CDK6 was
also found in four adenocarcinoma samples (Supplementary
Table S3).
Tyrosine kinase copy number alterations. A survey of
tyrosine kinase gene copy number identified four receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes, FGFR1, ERBB2 (Her-2/neu), MET
(HGFR), and EGFR, as being highly amplified (copy number z8)
in at least one sample. These kinase genes were found in regions
containing several genes and, therefore, the targets of the
amplicons are still unknown. Whereas some of these amplifica-
tions are rare, we mention them because of the possibility of
targeted therapy directed against aberrantly expressed protein
tyrosine kinases.
A novel amplification of chromosome 8p11.2-p11.1 was identi-
fied, which includes the FGFR1 gene. High-level amplification (copy
number z8) was found in two NSCLC samples, S0449T and
MGH1622T (Fig. 4A) and was confirmed by real time PCR (Table 1);
lower level copy number gains (copy number z4) were found in
four additional NSCLC samples. Amplification of the FGFR1 locus
has been found in other tumor types, including breast and urinary
carcinoma (41, 42, 52). However, the role of FGFR1 in lung
tumorigenesis remains unknown and we have no evidence to
implicate FGFR1 as the target of this amplicon.
The identification of ERBB2 , an RTK shown to be overexpressed
in many human tumors, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, and
NSCLC (53), has led to the development of the targeted breast
cancer therapy, trastuzumab (Herceptin; ref. 54). Over 4-fold
amplification (copy number z8) of the region surrounding ERBB2
was found in one adenocarcinoma cell line, H1819 (Fig. 4B).
Additional primary tumors, including two adenocarcinoma sam-
ples and one SCLC sample, had moderate copy number gains (copy
number z4) of the ERBB2 locus. Overexpression and activating
mutations of another RTK, MET, have been found in a variety of
tumor types (53). A high-level amplification (copy number = 10) of
chromosome 7q31.2 resolved into three peaks in the H1993 sample.
One of these peaks was a 390 kb amplicon that included MET
(Fig. 4C); lower-level gain of this region was found in two addi-
tional NSCLC samples.
EGFR mutation compared with EGFR amplification. We
sought to analyze amplification of the EGFR region in an unbiased
fashion and to determine the degree or correlation between
amplification, mutation (12), and expression (55) of EGFR within
the same lung carcinoma samples. Our analysis revealed
amplification of the EGFR region on chromosome 7p11.2 to copy
number z8 in one primary squamous cell carcinoma (S0480T), one
adenocarcinoma cell line (HCC827; Fig. 4D), and one primary
adenocarcinoma (AD347T; Tables 1 and 2). Interestingly, HCC827
also contains an EGFR mutation (Table 2), whereas AD347T and
S0480T do not.
Comparisons of EGFR amplification, mutation, and expression
data indicate that high and moderate level amplifications are not
always associated with EGFR gene mutation (Table 2). In addition,
17 samples run on SNP arrays, with known EGFR mutation status,
also had expression information available (Table 2). Samples with
EGFR mutation and/or copy number gain (copy number z4) of the
EGFR gene were shown to have higher average EGFR expression
than samples with wild type, unamplified EGFR on average, as
measured by two probe sets on Affymetrix U95AV2 arrays [1537_at
(EGFR): P = 0.035; 37327_at (EGFR): P = 0.004]. Our study shows
that mutations in the EGFR gene are at least partially independent
of EGFR gene amplification and that EGFR expression and
amplification are correlated.

Discussion
The present study represents the first application of genome-
wide copy number analysis in lung cancer by SNP array. Our
group and others recently showed that this technology provided
us with a unique opportunity to assess DNA copy number
changes and LOH simultaneously throughout the entire genome
(27, 28). Our results illustrate the application of SNP arrays to the
analysis of chromosomal alterations across lung cancer genomes.
The ability to identify aberrations in the chromosomal structure
of cancer cells, and the genes affected by them, has been
improved through the present analysis with high resolution. The
power of SNP arrays to detect small homozygous deletions with
high reliability has been shown in this study with the
identification of the novel chromosome 9p23 deletion. As used
on unpaired samples in this study, SNP array analysis is
comparable with oligonucleotide array CGH, although the SNP
arrays also offer the ability to identify copy-neutral LOH when
coupled with paired normal samples.
Targeting therapies based on the identification of specific chro-
mosomal abnormalities in tumor cells have already offered great
potential; inhibitors to kinases, such as BCR/ABL, KIT, ERBB2 , and
EGFR , have proven to be valuable as cancer therapies. Thus,
kinases, such as CDK4, FGFR1 , and MET, identified in this study
may be future therapeutic targets in lung cancers upon further
validation.
However, it is important to note that the presence of DNA copy
number changes does not provide absolute proof of an involve-
ment of these genes within the regions. Therefore, a detailed
characterization should be done to elucidate the significance of the
regions we have detected in this study, many of which may contain
candidate tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Novel loci
including the recurrent deletion within chromosome segments
3q25 and 9p23 and amplifications within 8q12-13, 12p11, and 22q11
will be of particular interest.
