ABSTRACT
Several reports suggest that CmCWGG methylation
tends not to co-exist with mCG methylation in
human cells. We have asked whether or not methyla-
tion at CCWGG sites can influence CG methylation.
DNA from cells expressing an M.EcoRII–GFP fusion
was actively methylated at CCWGG sites. CG methy-
lation as measured by R.HpaII/R.MspI ratios was
unchanged in cells expressing the transgene.
Cloned representatives of CmCWGG methylated
DNA often contained, or were adjacent to an ALU
repeat, suggesting that M.EcoRII-GFP actively
methylated gene-rich R-band DNA. The transgenic
methyltransferase applied CmCWGG methylation to
a representative human promoter that was heavily
methylated at CG dinucleotides (the SERPINB5
promoter) and to a representative promoter that
was essentially unmethylated at CG dinucleotides
(the APC promoter). In each case, the CG methylation
pattern remained in its original state, unchanged by
the presence of neighboring CmCWGG sites. Q-PCR
measurements showed that RNA expression from
the APC gene was not significantly altered by the
presence of CmCWGG in its promoter. Kinetic studies
suggested that an adjacent CmCWGG methylation
site influences neither the maintenance nor the
de novo methylation activities of purified human
Dnmt1. We conclude that CmCWGG methylation
does not exert a significant effect on CG methylation
in human kidney cells.
INTRODUCTION
The signals that set up and maintain somatic methylation
patterns are poorly understood. Most of the observed phenom-
ena are consistent with the enzymology of the DNA methyl-
transferases. Somatic inheritance of CG methylation patterns
is consistent with the capacity of a hemimethylated CG dyad
to focus Dnmt1 on the unmethylated cytosine residue in the
dyad and to stimulate its activity (1,2). The spreading of CG
methylation in a region is consistent with the formation and
subsequent resolution of hairpin loops (3–6). Moreover, the
detection of long-lived hemimethylated sites in DNA (7–10) is
consistent with the formation of hairpin loops or recombina-
tion intermediates in DNA (2,3,11–13), as are the targeting of
Dnmt1 to chromatin during the G2 phase of the cell cycle (14)
and the observation of active DNA methylation in G2 (15).
Activation of de novo methyltransferases by residual CG
methylation provides a possible explanation for the return of
CG methylation patterns after the removal of DNA methyl-
transferase inhibitors, such as 5-azacytidine (16,17); however,
this possibility has not been supported by enzymological
evidence. Alternatively, unusual structure formation
(3,4,11,12) or methyltransferase targeting to transcription
state-specific chromatin proteins (14,18,19) offer possible
explanations for this return.
Each of the phenomena above is primarily concerned with
the nature of the methylation process at the CG dinucleotide.
However, a significant body of evidence suggests that non-
CG methylation (cytosine methylation outside the CG dinuc-
leotide pair) is also present in human cells (10,20). The role of
this possible epigenetic mark is currently unknown [for
reviews see Clark et al. (21) and Lorincz and Groudine (22)].
Although its origin is controversial, it is apparently applied by
hDnmt3a, hDnmt3b, hDnmt2 or by the non-specific action of

other human DNA methyltransferases (23–28). Methylation at
the CCWGG (where W is defined as A or T) sequence is easily
detected in certain genes in peripheral blood lymphocytes and
its level appears to stand in reciprocal relation to the CG
methylation level when neighboring sequences are examined
(29,30). Moreover, it is possible that epigenetic marks at
CCWGG sites might be functional as appears to be the case
in plants (31,32). Of particular interest are reports suggesting
that CCWGG methylation tends not to co-exist with CG
methylation in human cells in the same region of DNA
(29,30,33,34). In this report we have studied the possibility
that the presence of CCWGG methylation has a direct effect
on CG methylation. This was accomplished by introducing the
bacterial DNA (Cytosine-5) methyltransferase M.EcoRII into
the HK293 human kidney cell line, and determining CG
methylation state in promoter regions that are methylated at
CCWGG sites by the bacterial enzyme. Our findings in vivo
are consistent with direct analyses of the effects of CCWGG
methylation containing oligodeoxynucleotides on Dnmt1
methylation kinetics in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning and expression of the NLS–M.EcoRII–GFP
fusion
Plasmid constructs. The EcoRII methyltransferase gene was
originally obtained as a 1.8 kb BglII/BamHI insert in the
pRT103 vector with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S pro-
moter upstream of M.EcoRII to drive its expression in plants
(31). Synthetic double-strand DNA encoding a translational
start ATG and viral (SV40) nuclear localization signal (NLS)
was then ligated upstream of and in frame with M.EcoRII.
The properties of the expressed M.EcoRII were normal as
determined by the methods described previously (35).
For use in human cells, the following series of subclonings
were performed. The 35S promoter, M.EcoRII gene (with
50ATG and NLS), and downstream polyadenylation signal
were cut out of pRT103 as an 3 kb HindIII fragment and
inserted into the HindIII site of pEGFP-N3, a mammalian
expression vector with the CMV promoter 50 to the gene
encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). This construct was
designated p2. It left the plant viral 35S promoter between the
CMV promoter and M.EcoRII. An XhoI digest of p2 cut sites
immediately 50 and 30 to the 35S promoter, released it and
allowed religation of the vector to produce a CMV-driven
M.EcoRII gene. This construct was designated p3. It still
contained the M.EcoRII stop codon as well as a poly(A) signal
between M.EcoRII and GFP. A new HindIII site was created
by mutagenesis at the 30 end of M.EcoRII, just before the
stop codon. Digestion with R.HindIII removed the M.EcoRII
stop codon and poly(A) sequence, and religation of the vector
fused M.EcoRII in frame with GFP. This construct was
designated p4 or pEcoGFP.
Since HK293 cells are insensitive to selection by G418 and
p4 contained the neomycin resistance gene, one more step was
taken to link the GFP and M.EcoRII-GFP genes to puromycin
resistance. The GFP gene was removed from pGFP-N3
with R.EcoRI and R.NotI and M.EcoRII–GFP was similarly
cut out of p4 with R.NheI and R.NotI. These were inserted
into the same sites within the polylinker of pIRESpuro3
(BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). This is a CMV-driven bicis-
tronic vector containing an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
downstream of the polylinker, allowing co-transcription of
GFP or M.EcoRII–GFP together with the puromycin resist-
ance gene. The same immediate early CMV promoter used
in pEGFP-N3 drives expression of the GFP gene and
the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion in the pIRESpuro3 subclones.
This last pair of constructs was designated pI-GFP and
pI-EcoGFP, and used in the experiments described here.
DNA manipulation, gel analysis, cloning and sequencing
DNA isolation. DNA was isolated from HK293 cells
essentially as described in Sambrook et al. (36) (Chapter 6,
Protocol 6), except that an additional chloroform extraction
was carried out after the phenol chloroform extraction used
in that method. DNA isolated in this fashion was 12 kb in
molecular length as judged by gel electrophoresis.
Digestion with methylation-sensitive isoschizomers. One
microgram lots of DNA at 0.1 mg/ml final concentration
were digested to completion with either 1 U/ml R.EcoRII or
1 U/ml R.BstNI. The R.EcoRII digestion was carried out in 1·
SuRE/Cut Buffer H (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany) at 37C for 2 h. The R.BstNI digestion was carried
out in 1· NEB buffer #2 containing 0.1 mg/ml NEB BSA
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 65C for 2 h. For
R.HpaII and R.MspI, digestion completeness was judged by
co-digestion of ØX174RFI DNA (37). For R.EcoRII
and R.BstNI, digestion completeness was assessed by
co-digestion of pBR322 DNA isolated from an Escherichia
coli dcm host. R.EcoRII was inactivated by heating at 65C
for 20 min.
Gel electrophoresis, analysis, cloning and sequencing
Before gel analysis, DNA digests were phenol extracted and
ethanol precipitated using the method described in Sambrook
et al. (36) (Appendix A8.9–A8.15) in order to remove enzymes
and BSA present during digestion. DNA was separated by
agarose gel electrophoresis using the methods described
previously (38).
Number average molecular weights (Mn) were estimated
from scans of ethidium bromide stained gels (Figure 1).
Using the weight fraction distribution developed in (39) it
can be shown that the number average molecular weight occurs
at the point in the weight distribution corresponding to 26% of
the total area of the scan of the lane measured from the bottom of
the gel. The relationship used was obtained as follows:
f N Lð Þ ¼ f 1fð ÞLf ‚
where L is the fragment length in bp and f is the cleavage
frequency in bp1.
Note that

Lf 2ef L dL:
FW Lð Þ ¼ 1 1 þ f Lð Þef L:
Thus, FW(L) is the weight fraction <L. If we set L ¼ LN
(the number average molecular weight of the digest) and
note LN ¼ 1/f, then the area from L ¼ 0 to L ¼ LN:
FW LNð Þ ¼ 1 1 þ f LNð Þef LN
FW LNð Þ ¼ 0:26:
Thus, an ethidum bromide stained gel can be photographed
and scanned, with an appropriate marker set in an adjacent
lane. The molecular weight of the DNA at the point dividing
the scan into 0.26 and 0.74 fractions is the number average
molecular weight of the digest. A total of six gels were obtained.
Scans were collected in duplicate using ImageQuant image
analysis software (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ),
and the point in the scan at which 26% of the area occurs
was mapped to a molecular weight based on its position in
a standard curve relating the position of standards of known
molecular length to distance traveled in the gel.
Molecular cloning. For the cloning of M.EcoRII protected
DNA, the region of gel containing the high-molecular weight
DNA spared by R.EcoRII was excised. The agarose-embedded
DNA was then digested with 10 U R.BstNI in NEB Buffer 2 and
BSA for 4 h at 60C. Then, 4 U of Klenow fragment was added
for2hat25Ctoblunt theDNA.DNAwasextracted fromthegel
using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eluted DNA
was ligated into pBluescript linearized by R.EcoRV digestion
and phosphatase treated. Clones containing an insert were
sequenced on an ABI sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA).
CG methylation status in CCWGG methylated
promoters by MS-PCR
We used the method of Futscher et al. (40) to assess
the methylation status of CG sites adjacent to CCWGG
methylated sites in two representative promoter sequences.
Genomic DNA from HK293 cells expressing M.EcoRII–
GFP or HK293 cells expressing GFP alone was isolated
using Qiagen’s QIAamp DNA Blood Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Ten micrograms of the
M.EcoRII–GFP DNA was digested with 100 U of R.EcoRII
in SuRE/Cut Buffer H (Roche GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
for 2 h at 37C. The digest was then phenol extracted, ethanol
precipitated and resuspended in 10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA,
pH 7.5. The final concentration was determined by spectro-
photometry. Five micrograms of uncut GFP and 5 mg of cut
EcoRII–GFP 293 genomic DNA was then bisulfite treated
using the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Chemicon Inter-
national, Temecula, CA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. An aliquot of 0.5 mg of this bisulfite treated
DNA was then amplified as described previously (40) except
that for GFP expressors the primer containing an R.EcoRII site
matched the unmethylated sequence while that for the
M.EcoRII–GFP expressors matched the methylated sequence.
The same strategy was used in amplifying and cloning
sequences from the promoter of the APC gene, except that
the following primers were used: APC EcoRII forward 50-
CAACAAACCTGACCATAATAAC-30, APC GFP forward
50-CAACAAACCTAACCATAATAAC-30, APC reverse 50-
TTAGGGTTAGGTAGGTTGTG-30. PCR for APC used a sin-
gle round of amplification utilizing a touchdown procedure of
95C for 30 s/all cycles, 55C for 30 s/5 cycles; 53C for 30 s/5
cycles; 51C for 30 s/20 cycles, 72C for 30 s/all cycles. Two
microliters of each PCR was used for cloning with a TOPO TA
Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing of 10 clones for each PCR
was carried out using an ABI automated sequencer.
RNA expression from a CCWGG methylated promoter
by Q-PCR
RNA expression from the APC gene was determined by use of
Quantitative RT–PCR (41). RNA was isolated from 10 week
HK293 cells from cells expressing GFP and M.EcoRII–GFP,
by use of an RNAqueous Kit, (Ambion, Austin, TX). Then

1 ml of isolated RNA was measured using the ND-1000
Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Ambion), and cross-checked
by using RNA microfluidics chips and the 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Q-PCR results were
generated using the iScript one-step RT–PCR kit with SYBR
green (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A 50 ng to 3.125 ng five-point
dilution curve was generated using a total of 19 ml of RNA
added to 2.5 ml of 10 mM each FWD and REV primers, 25 ml
iScript master mix and 1 ml iScript enzyme. hTERT expression
was used as a control, since promoter methylation at CG sites
is not obligatorily associated with gene silencing at this locus
(42,43). The following primers were used: APC FWD primer:
50-TTTGTCTTGGCGAGCAGA-30; the APC REV Primer:
50-CAAGCTGGACACATTCCG-30; the hTERT FWD
primer: 50-AGAGTGTCTGGAGCAAGTTGC-30; and the
hTERT REV primer: 50-CGTAGTCCATGTTCACAATCG-30.
The reaction was then performed in the Rotor-gene 3000
(Corbett Robotics, San Francisco, CA) with the following
protocol: 50C for 10 min, 95C for 5 min, then 40 cycles
of 95C for 15 s, 58C for 30 s, 72C for 60 s, 78C for 15 s,
85C for 15 s, and then one hold at 72C for 1 min, followed
by a default melt curve from 72C to 95C. All PCR products
were verified as the correct size by use of a 2% agarose gel and
appropriate DNA molecular weight markers. The slopes
of five independent Quantitative RT–PCR runs were used
for APC and hTERT RNA expression. The cut point on the
fluorescence axis at which the plot of cycle number versus log
(fluorescence) achieves the best linear fit of the data (Figure 7)
was determined by using the Corbett Research analysis
software: Rotor-gene 6 (Corbett Robotics). Analysis of N0
values [i.e. initial target RNA concentration determined
directly from the log-linear region of each amplification
curve using the software and the method described previously
(44) cross-checked using the second derivative method (45)]
gave similar results. Five sets of dilutions ranging from 50 ng
to 3.125 ng input total RNA were measured, yielding a total of
25 data points for each cell line.
Cell culture
Human kidney 293 cells were grown at 37C with humidity
and 5% CO2, in DMEM (Mediatech, Herdon VA) containing
10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and standard antibiotics (25 U/ml
penicillin and 25 mg/ml streptomycin) (Invitrogen) in addition
to 25 mg/ml erythromycin (Sigma, St Louis, MO). For normal
maintenance, cells were passaged once per week at fairly low
density (1:10–1:20) and re-fed every 2–3 days. In passaging,
cells were trypsinized with 1/2· trypsin in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)—i.e. a 1:1 mixture of standard trypsin/EDTA
(500 U/ml trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA) and 1· PBS. To min-
imize typical HK293 cell clumping, 1–2 ml trypsinized and
triturated cells were added to 5 ml of fresh medium and spun
at 1000 g for 5 min, whereupon the cell pellet was well resus-
pended in 0.5 ml of 1/2· trypsin for 40–50 s. An aliquot of 1.5
ml of medium was mixed with this and 1/10 to 1/20 of the
volume was added to a new plate with fresh medium. To
expand cell numbers, cells were passaged at 1:1–1:3.
Transfections
For transfections, 1 · 106 cells/10 cm dish were plated in
7.5 ml medium. After 20–24 h the cells were re-fed with
5 ml medium, and were transfected 1.5–2.5 h after that. Trans-
fection was by standard CaPO4 method with chloroquine, as
described in (36), except for the following: 50 mg plasmid
DNA was mixed with 0.5 ml each 2· CaCl2 and 2·
HEPES-buffered saline per plate, and transfections were
allowed to go overnight (16–20 h). The day transfection
began was called ‘day 1’ of an experiment. Plates were washed
once the next day with warm 1· PBS, re-fed with 6 ml
medium, and maintained as above until the time of harvesting
and analysis. Transfection efficiencies were typically 60%.
For stable transfections, puromycin (Sigma) was added at
0.5 mg/ml to the medium of the cells on days 3–5, depending
on the day of cell sorting, and surviving cells were grown as
a pool.
Cell sorting
For cell sorting, cells were processed as above (passaging),
with the cell pellets resuspended at 5–10 · 106/ml in DMEM
with 20% FCS and placed on ice. A high speed MoFlo MLS
sorter by Dako Cytomation (Fort Collins, CO) was used to
sterilely sort for GFP positive cells in the City of Hope Flow
Cytometry core facility. Positive cells, fluorescent at 508 nm
above background using 488 nm excitation, were sorted into
DMEM and 20% FCS, after which they were spun down as
above and either re-plated or frozen for future DNA extraction.
Plating efficiency and survival of sorted cells was much better
on poly-L-lysine treated plates. For this, poly-L-lysine hydro-
bromide (Sigma) was resuspended in water to 20 mg/ml,
filter sterilized, and added to plates at 3 ml/10 cm, and
these were incubated at room temperature while gently rock-
ing for 15–20 min. Plates were then washed three times with
5 ml sterile water and kept wrapped until use.
End counting with the cytosine extension assay
The protocol used was a modification of the method published
by Pogribny et al. (46,47). Genomic DNA (0.75 mg) was
digested for 2 h with a 10-fold excess of methylation-
sensitive R.HpaII (New England Biolabs) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. A second DNA aliquot (0.75 mg)
was digested simultaneously with methylation-insensitive iso-
schizomer R.MspI (New England Biolabs). A third DNA ali-
quot (0.75 mg) was incubated without restriction enzyme and
served as a background control. After incubation, the samples
were placed on ice for a minimum of 5 min to stop the reaction.
The single nucleotide extension reaction was performed in
40 ml of a mixture containing 0.75 mg genomic DNA,
1· NEB Buffer 2 (New England Biolabs), 10 U of Klenow
fragment/exo (New England Biolabs) and 4 mM [3H]dCTP
(Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). After incubating at 15C for 1 h,
the mixture was placed on ice for a minimum of 5 min to stop
the reaction. Thirty-five microliters of sample was then applied
to DE-81 ion-exchange filter paper (Whatman, Middlesex,
UK) and washed three times with sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0) at room temperature. The filters were air dried and
processed for scintillation counting. Four replicates were gen-
erated per sample. The [3H]dCTP incorporation into DNA was
expressed as mean disintegrations per minute (d.p.m.) per 0.75
mg of DNA. The absolute percent of double-stranded
unmethylated CCGG sites was calculated as follows:
(R.HpaII induced d.p.m/R.MspI induced d.p.m) (100%).
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 19 6127
In addition to running the undigested control, we included an
aliquot of lambda DNA as a positive control suitable for high
levels of [3H]dCTP incorporation, and an aliquot of lambda
DNA that had been methylated in vitro with M.SssI (New
England Biolabs) as a negative control suitable for low levels
of [3H]dCTP incorporation.
Dnmt1 purification and kinetics
Methods of purification and kinetic analysis for human
DNMT1 were those described in Clark et al. (48).
RESULTS
Construction of expression vectors
Two constructs have been used. One construct (pI-GFP)
carries the GFP gene alone. The other (pI-EcoGFP) carries
a bacterial methyltransferase–GFP fusion with a viral (SV40)
NLS. In both constructs, expression is driven by a cyto-
megalovirus (CMV) promoter and selection for expression
in human cells is based on the expression of a polycistronic
message carrying a 30 puromycin resistance coding sequence.
Expression of M.EcoRII
Each of the two constructs was transfected into HK293
followed by long-term growth under puromycin selection.
GFP fluorescence was easily detected with fluorescence
microscopy when either construct was used. A representative
light microscope image is shown in Figure 2A and the
corresponding fluorescence microscopy image is shown in
Figure 2B. Cell sorting data for the GFP expression construct
are shown in Figure 3A, and that for the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion
is shown in Figure 3B. Cells exhibiting GFP fluorescence after
transfection with vectors carrying GFP alone were consistently
observed to be present in significantly larger numbers than
those exhibiting fluorescence after transfection with the
M.EcoRII–GFP fusion (Figure 3). This was true for cells
expressing the two constructs for a short time with or without
puromycin selection, or for a longer period under puromycin
selection.
The cells used in this study were selected as follows:
separate lots of cells were transfected with equal amounts
of the two vectors and allowed to recover for 3–5 days in
non-selective medium. They were then selected for GFP fluor-
escence by cell sorting. When sorted fluorescent cells were
re-plated in equal numbers and subjected to a round of selec-
tion by passage in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml puromycin
for 16 days, the percentage of fluorescent cells expressing GFP
alone was again greater than the percentage of fluorescent cells
expressing the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion. Equal numbers of these
puromycin-resistant, fluorescent cells were again plated in
medium containing 0.5 mg/ml puromycin and passaged in
this medium for 21 days. After this final 21-day selection,
puromycin-resistant cells expressing fluorescence made up
more than 80% of the population from the M.EcoRII–GFP
fusion culture, while puromycin-resistant cells expressing
fluorescence made up 100% of the GFP culture (Figure 4).

De novo methylation of CCWGG sites
In general, the observation of fluorescence from a C-terminal
GFP fusion protein indicates that the N-terminal region con-
taining the protein of interest has folded properly because
protein folding is initiated at the N-terminus. Thus, we
expected that M.EcoRII–GFP fusion would be capable of
methylating DNA at CCWGG sites because fluorescence
was observed in the nucleus. To determine whether or not
CCWGG sites were methylated in transfected cells, high-
molecular weight chromosomal DNA was isolated from
transfectants expressing the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion or GFP
alone. This DNA was then digested with the isoschizomers
R.EcoRII and R.BstNI. These enzymes both recognize the
CCWGG site, but R.EcoRII cleavage is blocked by CmCWGG
methylation (C5-methylation at the internal cytosine) while
R.BstNI cleavage is not. As shown in Figure 5, R.EcoRII
cleavage is blocked only in cells expressing the M.EcoRII–
GFP fusion, indicating that significant methylation at
CCWGG sites in human chromosomal DNA had occurred
only in those cells expressing the fusion.
The non-digested Eco-GFP DNA (Figure 5) had a number
average molecular weight of 2.8 ± 0.1 kb. The R.BstNI diges-
ted Eco-GFP DNA had a number average molecular weight of
0.85 ± 0.01 kb and that of the GFP DNA was 0.79 ± 0.01 kb
the R.EcoRII digest of the GFP DNA had a number average
molecular weight of 1.3 ± 0.1 kb and that of the R.EcoRII
digested Eco-GFP DNA was 2.8 ± 0.1 kb. For a genome of
3.0 · 109 bp this implies that about 1.53 · 106/2.51 ·
106 ¼ 60% of the genomic CCWGG sites were methylated
in HK293 cells expressing GFP, and 2.48 · 106/2.44 · 106 or
100% of the genomic CCWGG sites were methyated in the
HK293 cells expressing the transgenic methyltransferase.
Representative sequences from the CCWGG
methylated DNA
In order to study the protected DNA further, the band of
genomic DNA remaining after treatment of Eco-GFP DNA
with R.EcoRII was cut from agarose gels, purified and
digested with R.BstNI. As a control, the same region of agar-
ose gel from the GFP DNA treated with R.EcoRII, was treated
in the same way although no band was visible. The R.BstNI-
cleaved DNA was cloned as described in Materials and
Methods, and multiple transformants were analyzed by
sequencing. Characteristics of representative sequences cloned
from the R.EcoRII protected DNA area are depicted in Table 1.
Only two clones were obtained from the unprotected DNA
from the GFP expressors, in agreement with the low level of
R.EcoRII protected DNA shown in Figure 5. However, numer-
ous clones were obtained from the R.EcoRII protected DNA
obtained from the cells expressing the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion.
Of the 32 clones sequenced 16 contained an ALU sequence
or were adjacent to an ALU sequence. Of the total number of
bases cloned and sequenced (3900 bp) 31% (1200 bp)
were from the various ALU families.
Global CG methylation levels GFP and
M.EcoRII–GFP fusion expressors
We wished to determine if ectopic expression of the non-CG
methyltransferase could affect the global level of CG methyla-
tion. To test this we determined the ratio of cleavage at the
CCGG tetranucleotide using end-counting for R.HpaII and
R.MspI digests of DNA from the transfectants expressing
the M.EcoRII-GFP fusion or GFP alone. The mean dpm values
are given in Table 2. The R.HpaII/R.MspI ratios were essen-
tially identical, indicating that no significant change in CG
methylation at the CCGG tetranucleotide had occurred in the
transfectants expressing the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion.
CG methylation status in CCWGG
methylated promoters
Since general levels of CG methylation measured with the
end-counting method above do not necessarily reflect the
level of CG methylation at promoter sequences, we inspected
the CG methylation levels at two representative promoters.

transfected cells (M.EcoRII–GFP fusion expressors) is given in grey. After each round of sorting, equal numbers of GFP positive cells were re-plated for

One of them, SERPINB5, is methylated at CG sites while the
other, the APC promoter, is unmethylated at CG sites in
HK293 cells expressing GFP alone. The methylation status
of CG sites adjacent to CCWGG methylated sites in the SER-
PINB5 and APC promoters are shown in Figures 6 and
7, respectively. In each case, the methylation state of CG
sequences seen in the cell line expressing GFP alone was
not altered by adjacent CmCWGG methylation applied to
the promoters by the M.EcoRII–GFP expressors.
RNA expression from a CCWGG methylated promoter
Since CmCWGG has been suggested to be a negative regulator
of gene expression in human cells (29,30), it was important to
determine whether or not the expression of the APC gene was
downregulated by CmCWGG methylation in its promoter
sequence. The relative abundance of the APC target sequence
RNA in total RNA was determined using Q-PCR as described
in Materials and Methods. The data are shown in Figure 8.
The expression level was not altered significantly in cells
expressing M.EcoRII–GFP compared with cells expressing
GFP. Expression from the hTERT gene was also unaltered
by the presence of the active CCWGG methyltransferase.
Thus, CmCWGG methylation does not appear to be a negative
regulator of these genes in HK293 cells.
Kinetic analysis of the effect of CmCWGG
methylation of Dnmt1
Using an oligodeoxynucleotide sequence from the region of
the SERPINB5 promoter, spanning the EcoRII site [labeled:
Internal EcoRII, in Figure 6B], we compared the saturation
curves for the sequences containing no methylated sites,
a single CmCWGG site, a single mCG site and both a single
CmCWGG site, and a single mCG. As can be seen from the data
in Figure 9 human Dnmt1 methylated asymmetrically methy-
lated DNA most rapidly. Moreover, the rate of methylation
induced by the presence of the asymmetrically methylated
CG site was not significantly affected by the presence of
the adjacent asymmetrically methylated CCWGG.
DISCUSSION
Beginning with reports on non-CG methylation in plants, there
is now a significant body of evidence suggesting that non-CG
methylation is present in most eukaryotes and thus may play a
biological role in eukaryotes. For example, methylation levels
in Dictyostelium (49) can be no more than 0.2% of cytosine,
although CG deficiency in this A+T-rich genome suggests that
some methylation is present (50). Adult Drosophila have no
CG methylation (51); however, there are data supporting the
presence of non-CG methylation in this organism (52–55).
In human cells non-CG methylation may be the predominant
form of methylation (20). The existence of an active alternat-
ive methyltransferase with non-CG specificity can be inferred
from reports showing that the majority of 5mC in humans is
on repeated sequences at non-CG sites (10,20), coupled with
in vitro evidence suggesting that hDnmt1 is not capable of
Figure 5. Detection of M.EcoRII activity from the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion
expression vector. After 21 days of selection with 0.5 mM puromycin, fluor-
escent cells were harvested and genomic DNA was prepared. The DNA was
digested with the isoschizomers R.EcoRII and R.BstNI. In this pair,
R.EcoRII is unable to cleave the CmCWGG site when the internal cytosine
is methylated. While R.BstNI is unaffected by cytosine-5 methylation at
this site.

mediating the somatic inheritance of CWG methylation
patterns (2). The specificity of target recognition of methyl-
transferases is generally preserved in the fusion proteins that
have been studied (56–58); thus, it does not seem unreasonable
to attempt to study sequence recognition in cloned mammalian
methyltransferase fusion proteins of different types. The best
evidence using these fusions suggests that CCWGG methyla-
tion observed in mammalian cells may be generated by the
action of hDnmt3a, hDnmt3b, hDnmt2 or by the non-specific
action of other human DNA methyltransferases (23–28).
Adenine-N6 methylation does not occur in higher euka-
ryotes. Gingeras and co-workers (59) have shown that the
expression of an adenine-N6 methyltransferase in mammalian
cells does not appear to alter the phenotype of mammalian
cells. However, Baylin and co-workers (60) found that
expressing the bacterial cytosine-5 methyltransferase M.HhaI
in mouse 3T3 cells results in the introduction of CG methyla-
tion at the GCGC tetramer and the selection of significant
phenotypic alterations.
Our experiments did not identify phenotypic changes asso-
ciated with M.EcoRII expression in human embryonic kidney
cells. Since the cells were sorted based on the level of fluor-
escence detected from GFP or from the M.EcoRII–GFP
fusion, the difference we observe in the number of fluorescent
cells could result from either a difference in transcription or
translation efficiency that decreases the level of expression
of the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion protein relative to the level of
expression of GFP alone, or from some form of toxicity caused
by the expression of M.EcoRII–GFP. We favor the possibility
that translation from a subset of the M.EcoRII–GFP integrants
is diminished (possibly by alterations near the two ATG’s near
its translation start site). This would explain the requirement
for extensive cell sorting to homogenize the population for
high levels of M.EcoRII–GFP expression.
Even so, the initial drop in the number of GFP positive cells
expressing the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion can also be explained if
expression levels are high in all integrants and cell sorting is
required in order to select for cells that can tolerate the expres-
sion of the fusion. The apparent toxic effects of the expres-
sion might result from the capacity of the M.EcoRII–GFP
fusion protein to methylate DNA at CCWGG sites. Alternat-
ively, these effects might result from the capacity of the

M.EcoRII–GFP fusion protein to bind DNA and thereby inter-
fere with normal replication and transcription functions in
human cells. We initially sought to distinguish between
these two forms of toxicity by constructing a catalytically
inactive form of the enzyme for transformation under the
conditions used here. However, we have noted (J. Clark,
E. Singer, and S. S. Smith, unpublished data) that catalytically
inactive DNA methyltransferases bind tightly to DNA in vitro
based on gel retardation experiments. Thus such an experiment
would be inconclusive.
Although we cannot determine the mechanism from the data
at hand, it is clear that cell cultures in which a high percentage
of cells express both the N-acetyl-transferase protein from the
puromycin resistance gene and M.EcoRII–GFP fusion protein
from the methyltransferase gene are more difficult to select
than cell cultures expressing both the puromycin resistance
enzyme and the GFP protein alone.
As expected, only the cell line expressing the M.EcoRII–
GFP fusion protein acquired methylation at CCWGG sites.
Methylation at this site was shown to span relatively large
regions of DNA (Figure 5) where CCWGG methylated seg-
ments as large as 10 and 12 kb could be detected. Although the
sample of 32 clones is small, a significant over-representation
of ALU sequences is present in the R.EcoRII-protected DNA.
Since ALU sequences are preferentially found in the R-band,
gene-rich fractions of the genome, it would appear that the
M.EcoRII–GFP fusion gains access to the gene-rich fractions
of the HK293 genome.
In spite of the significant level of CmCWGG methylation
generated by the expression of the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion, it
had no detectable effect on global methylation at CG sites as
measured by end-counting with the cytosine extension assay
(Table 2). A similar lack of effect on bulk methylation was
observed in a previous study when the CG methyltransferase
M.HhaI was expressed in mouse cells (60). In that case it was
suggested that the absolute level of CG methylation was main-
tained constant whereas the patterning of CG methylation was
shifted. Given reports suggesting that CCWGG methylation
is not found adjacent to CG methylation in human
cells (29,30,33,34), it was possible that the pattern of CG

methylation was shifted in the cells we used. However, this is
consistent neither with the enzymological evidence for Dnmt1
(Figure 9) nor with the data on the individual promoters we
investigated (Figures 6 and 7).
Since the patterning of CG methylation appears to be care-
fully controlled at promoter sequences, it was of interest to
determine whether or not CmCWGG methylation applied by
the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion altered CG methylation patterning

at representative promoters. Although the ALU cloning evid-
ence suggested that the transgenically expressed enzyme
gained access to gene-rich sequences, it was not clear that
it would be able to methylate a heavily CG methylated pro-
moter that presumably resides in condensed chromatin. In fact
studies with yeast expressing transgenic M.BspRI (61), the
E.coli Dam methyltransferase (62) and M.SssI (63) suggested
that condensed chromatin sites might not be accessible to
prokaryotic methyltransferases. Thus, we inspected the
SERPINB5 promoter region in HK293 cells expressing the
M.EcoRII–GFP fusion because it is known to be heavily
methylated at CG sites in this cell line (40). Consistent
with the enzymological evidence (Figure 9), no difference
in patterning was observed for CG sites in this promoter
when CmCWGG was introduced (Figure 6), nor was the bac-
terial enzyme activity in the M.EcoRII–GFP fusion excluded
from the promoter sequence. In addition, no difference in
methylation patterning at CG sites was observed (Figure 7)
when CmCWGG was introduced at the APC promoter (a pro-
moter that is not methylated at CG sites in this cell line). Both
findings are consistent with the enzymology of wild-type
Dnmt1 isolated from human placenta as reported previously
(1,48,64–66). This makes it unlikely that the selection process
we used has selected for an altered form of Dnmt1.
Thus, strong conclusions can be made that are independent
of the nature of the cells that result from selecting for the
expression of M.EcoRII–GFP. First, we conclude that the
transgenically expressed M.EcoRII–GFP fusion can methylate
gene-rich genomic DNA sequences in both condensed and
more open chromatin conformations in viable human cells.
Second, we conclude that neither the transient presence of
M.EcoRII–GFP nor the CmCWGG that it applies have a direct
effect on either bulk levels of CG methylation or the patterning
on CG methylation at CG sites in HK293 cells.
The data on RNA expression from the APC gene are also
consistent with this conclusion. Continued expression from the
CmCWGG methylated promoter suggests that methylation at
CCWGG sites may not be tightly coupled to gene expression.
However, if we assume that non-CG methylation does not
naturally occur at this promoter, then the lack of response
might be expected. Further, Malone et al. (30) have suggested
that the effects of CCWGG methylation may be mediated by
the CCWGG binding proteins they observe in lymophoma
cells. Thus, the lack of effect we observe could also indicate
that these proteins are absent in HK293 cells.
Finally, it is important to point out that the Q-PCR showing
no significant change in expression from APC is supported
by the bisulfite sequencing data on APC. This is because the
promoter region inspected has been studied by many groups
interested in the expression of the APC tumor-suppressor gene
(67). The results of those studies show that this region is
methylated at CG sites in tumor cells that do not express
the gene. Thus, CG methylation in this region, although it
may or may not play an active role in downregulating the

SERPINB5 oligodeoxynucleotide substrates with varying states of methylation at CCWGG and adjacent CG site are depicted. Duplex 1: saturation curve for the
unmethylated duplex. Duplex 2: saturation curve for the duplex carrying a hemimethylated CCWGG site. Duplex 3: saturation curve for the duplex carrying a
hemimethylated CG site. Duplex 4: saturation curve for the duplex with both the CCWGG and the CG sites in the hemimethylated state.

gene, is clearly a marker of the downregulated state. For this
reason, continued expression of RNA from the APC gene
provides an independent confirmation of the lack of influence
of CCWGG methylation on CG methylation in the APC pro-
moter. Based on the prepondeance of evidence in the field, it is
reasonable to expect that if the CCWGG methylation had
downregulated APC expression, CG methylation would
now be expected to mark the downregulated state. APC modu-
lation of the hDnmt1 promoter is also consistent with this
result, since downregulation of APC would be expected to
enhance CG methylation levels through an elevation of
hDnmt1 expression as reported in (68).
In summary then, all of the data presented are consistent
with the conclusion that CCWGG methylation does not
directly force changes in CG methylation.
