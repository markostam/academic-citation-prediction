ABSTRACT
We have investigated how a benzo[a]pyrene-derived
N2-dG adduct, 10S(+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG
([BP]G), is processed in a well-characterized Pol I
family model replicative DNA polymerase, Bacillus
fragment (BF). Experimental results are presented
that reveal relatively facile nucleotide incorporation
opposite the lesion, but very inefficient further
extension. Computational studies follow the possi-
ble bypass of [BP]G through the pre-insertion,
insertion and post-insertion sites as BF alternates
between open and closed conformations. With dG
in the normal B-DNA anti conformation, BP ser-
iously disturbs the polymerase structure, position-
ing itself either deeply in the pre-insertion site or on
the crowded evolving minor groove side of the
modified template, consistent with a polymerase-
blocking conformation. With dG in the less pre-
valent syn conformation, BP causes less distortion:
it is either out of the pre-insertion site or in the major
groove open pocket of the polymerase. Thus, the
syn conformation can account for the observed
relatively easy incorporation of nucleotides, with
mutagenic purines favored, opposite the [BP]G
adduct. However, with the lesion in the BF post-
insertion site, more serious distortions caused by
the adduct even in the syn conformation explain the
very inefficient extension observed experimentally.
In vivo, a switch to a potentially error-prone bypass
polymerase likely dominates translesion bypass.
INTRODUCTION
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environ-
mental pro-carcinogens that are produced during combus-
tion of organic materials (1). Benzo[a]pyrene (BP), one of
the most extensively studied PAHs, is found in a wide
range of substances ingested or inhaled by humans, such
as automobile exhaust, tobacco smoke and food (1–3).
Several BP metabolic activation pathways have been
delineated (4–6). The predominant diol epoxide pathway
yields, among others, the major reactive (+)-anti-
benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) (6). The (+)-anti-
BPDE enantiomer is highly mutagenic and tumorigenic in
mammals (7). This metabolite can react chemically with
DNA, forming several bulky BP-base adducts, among
which the 10S(+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG ([BP]G) adduct
(Figure 1) is dominant and is the focus of this study
(8–11). This adduct can lead to mutations when replicated
in vivo and in vitro (12–24). Although such bulky adducts
mainly block replicative DNA polymerases, error-prone
bypass can occur in vivo if the blocked replicative
polymerase is replaced by one or more bypass polymerases
(25–31). Nevertheless, replicative polymerases are also
able to bypass such adducts, though rarely, with
potentially mutagenic consequences (32,33).
Bacillus fragment (BF) is a Pol I family replicative DNA
polymerase large fragment from a thermophilic strain of
Bacillus stearothermophilus (34). Our focus on this
particular replicative polymerase is motivated by the
availability of high-resolution BF crystal structures of a
binary complex (PDB ID: 1L3S) with enzyme and primer/
template DNA, and a ternary complex (PDB ID: 1LV5)
which contains, in addition, an incoming Watson-Crick
paired 20-deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) (35). BF
adopts an open conformation in the binary complex.
Placement of the correct dNTP partner opposite the
template base causes the ﬁngers domain to close tightly
around the active site via an induced-ﬁt mechanism
(36–39) to form a reaction-ready ternary complex (35,
40–43). Three important sites have been delineated at and
near the active site of BF, namely the pre-insertion,
insertion and post-insertion sites. The pre-insertion site, in
the ﬁngers domain, is composed of two helices, O and O1,
and the loop connecting them. In the open BF, the pre-
insertion site is occupied by the base next-to-be replicated,
while the insertion site is blocked by a critical polymerase

amino acid residue, Tyr-714. When the polymerase closes,
the base which was previously in the pre-insertion site
moves to the insertion site, where it pairs with the incoming
dNTP and the insertion site is no longer blocked by Tyr-
714. The pre-insertion site is blocked by the loop
connecting the O and O1 helices. After the incoming
dNTP is incorporated into the 30-end of the primer, the
polymerase opens again, the DNA translocates, and
the new base pair moves to the post-insertion site. The
insertion site is now again blocked by Tyr-714, the pre-
insertion site is occupied by the next-to-be-replicated
template base and the replication cycle continues (35).
Thus, the pre-insertion, insertion and post-insertion sites
are vital to the functioning of this type of polymerase.
An incompletely resolved open BF crystal structure
with the [BP]G adduct as the base next-to-be-replicated
and a well-resolved open BF crystal structure with
[BP]G at the post-insertion site paired with cytosine
(PDB ID: 1XC9) (44) provide partial insights into the
inhibition of a replicative polymerase by a bulky adduct.
These two structures represent the stages before and
after nucleotide insertion opposite the adduct, respec-
tively. In the incompletely resolved structure, the
adducted guanine, which would occupy the pre-insertion
site if not modiﬁed by the BP moiety, is disordered, is
not located in the pre-insertion site, and is not poised
for the next step of nucleotide incorporation. In the
well-resolved structure, the modiﬁed dG adopts a
normal anti conformation with the BP rings on the
DNA minor groove side. Normally on this side there are
extensive interactions between DNA and the BF
polymerase, constituting a scanning track that is most
important in ensuring polymerase ﬁdelity and processiv-
ity (45–49). Placement of the BP in this position disrupts
the track. In addition, the presence of the adduct
distorts the primer end so that the 30-OH is no longer in
an appropriate position for attacking the a-phosphate of
the incoming dNTP during nucleotide incorporation.
The position of the BP is such that it would interfere
with dNTP binding and polymerase closing.
In the present work we investigated, using molecular
modeling and dynamics simulations, how the representa-
tive replicative polymerase, BF, treats the [BP]G adduct
through an entire replication cycle. The availability of the
series of crystal structures with well-characterized sites
employed in the replicative cycle presents an excellent
opportunity to elucidate molecular details of lesion
processing in this model system. We investigated the
eﬀect of the [BP]G adduct on the crystallographically
well-determined BF structures, considering for the ﬁrst

well as the pre-insertion, insertion and post-insertion sites.
This work builds on earlier studies involving the [BP]G
adduct in closed ternary complexes of the Pol I family
DNA polymerase from phage T7 (50–52). Our primer
extension and single dNTP insertion studies provide the
experimental foundation for the modeling studies. The
experimental data clearly show predominant polymerase
blockage with a small amount of lesion bypass and
preferential insertion of purines opposite the adduct. Our
modeling studies provide molecular views of the various
intermediates in the multi-step process of replication past
the bulky [BP]G adduct, enabling us to gain a better
understanding of the structural properties leading to
predominant polymerase blockage and to rationalize the
rare mutagenic lesion bypass. Blockage is engendered by
substantial distortions of the active site in the anti
glycosidic bond conformation of the dG, while some
bypass appears feasible when this bond is in the less
distorting syn conformation; the syn conformation also
supports the preferential misincorporation of purines
opposite the lesion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals, enzymes and oligonucleotides
[g-32P] ATP (3000 ci/mmol) was purchased from Perkin-
Elmer Life Sciences, Inc. (Boston, MA). The dNTPs,
dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP were purchased from
New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). BF was
prepared as described previously (34). The 11-mer
oligonucleotides with a central triple base motif
CACACGGACAC were synthesized by standard phos-
phoramidite methods on a Biosearch Cyclone auto-
mated DNA synthesizer (Milligen-Biosearch Corp., San
Rafael, CA) and were puriﬁed and desalted by standard
HPLC protocols. The site-speciﬁcally modiﬁed oligo-
deoxynucleotides were ligated to a 13-mer and a 19-mer
to form 43-mer template oligonucleotide strands, 50-
GAC TAC GTA CTG TCA CAC GGA CAC GCT
ATC TGG CCA GAT CCG C-30. The ligated
oligonucleotides were further puriﬁed and desalted by
three successive ethanol precipitations. The quality of
the samples was veriﬁed by gel electrophoresis; ﬂuores-
cence and UV absorption spectroscopy were employed
to further verify that the BP residue was intact.
Running-start primer extension
The 43-mer templates were annealed with a 50-end
32P-labeled 22-mer primer. The BP modiﬁed guanine
residue was positioned at template position 25 counted
from the 30 end of the template strand (Figure 2a). The
time course of primer extension assays of the adducted
templates were carried out at 378C. The standard 30 ml
reactions contained 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5mM
MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 50 mg/ml BSA, 4% glycerol, 4.5 nM
primer:template (1:1.5 ratio) complexes, 200 mM dNTPs
and 20 nM of BF. The experiments were stopped after
pre-selected time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 30min) by
the addition of a 5 ml stop solution (20mM EDTA in
95% formamide, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and 0.05%
xylene cyanol) to the reaction mixture. The samples
were then heated at 908C for 5min, chilled on ice and
then applied to a 15–20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel
containing 7M urea. The replication products were
visualized by autoradiography and quantitatively ana-
lyzed by a Storm 840 phosphorimager and the Storm
ImageQuant software (Amersham).
Single dNTP insertion opposite the template lesion site
The 43-mer templates were annealed with a 50-end
32P-labeled 24-mer primer. The one-step insertion assays
of each dNTP (2mM) opposite the modiﬁed guanine were
performed utilizing 15 nM primer/template complexes and
2 nM BF concentrations at 378C for 30min. The products
were visualized and analyzed in the same manner as the
running-start primer extension assays.
Molecular modeling
The crystal structures of the open binary complex (PDB
ID: 1L3S) and the closed ternary complex (PDB ID:
1LV5) of BF (35) were used as the starting structures
for molecular modeling with coordinates obtained from
the Protein Data Bank (53). All molecular modeling was
carried out using Insight 2000.1 (Accelrys, Inc., a
subsidiary of Pharmacopeia, Inc.). The original crystal
structures of the ternary and binary complexes were
remodeled (full details provided in Supplementary
Data). The remodeled complexes were then used to
build the initial models for the molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. The [BP]G was modeled into (i) the
pre-insertion site of open BF; (ii) the insertion site of
closed BF; (iii) the post-insertion site of open BF; and
(iv) the post-insertion site of closed BF, representing
four important steps as the adduct threads through the
polymerase (Figure 3a). The DNA sequences were
remodeled to match that used experimentally.
According to the diﬀerent positions of [BP]G in BF
at the four steps, four corresponding structures were
built (Figure 3b). We then made a grid search, at 58
intervals in combination of , a0, and b0, for structures
with minimal close contacts, within the ranges:
(anti)=230 508, (syn)=40 408, a0=0–3608, and
b0=270 608 [near the low energy domain of b0, which
governs the orientation of this stereoisomer (54)]. Thus
we investigated both anti and syn conformations of the
glycosidic torsion angle  (Figure 1) of the BP modiﬁed
dG at each of the four steps. Starting from Step 2, we
placed the normal partner C opposite the anti-[BP]G
and all four partners opposite the syn-[BP]G. For the
anti case, one [BP]G conformation with fewest colli-
sions was found for each of Steps 1, 2 and 4; two
conformations were found for Step 3, one similar to the
available crystal structure and the other diﬀerent from
it. We also simulated the available crystal structure.
Therefore, three initial models were investigated for the
anti-[BP]G at Step 3. For the syn case, one [BP]G
conformation was found for each of the four steps. The
torsion angles in the initial models for all four steps are
given in Table S1. For each step, an unmodiﬁed control,

containing normal partner C, where appropriate, was
also constructed for comparison. All initial models are
shown in Figure S2.
Force field parameterization
Full details are given in Supplementary Data.
MD simulation protocol
MD simulations were carried out using the SANDER
module of AMBER 7.0 (55) with the Cornell et al. force
ﬁeld (56) and the parm99.dat parameter set (57).
Following equilibration, 2 ns of production MD were
carried out. Full details are given in Supplementary Data.
Trajectory analysis
Trajectories were collected for each modiﬁed system and
its corresponding unmodiﬁed control, and were analyzed
using the PTRAJ and CARNAL modules of the AMBER
package (55) to obtain ensemble average values for
properties of interest.
Stability of theMD simulations
The RMSDs (root-mean-square deviations) of the whole
structure of each system, calculated relative to the ﬁrst
production frame, are shown in Figure S3. The RMSDs
of the active site, composed of all the residues within 5 A˚
of the nascent base pair relative to the ﬁrst frame, are
also provided (Figure S3). We found that all systems are
stable after 800 ps. The following analyses are based on
this range. All structural ﬁgures were prepared using
PyMOL (58).
RESULTS
BF is mainly blocked by [BP]G but allows some bypass
Running-start primer-extension experiments were carried
out with the primer terminus several nucleotides away
from the lesion site (Figure 2a). The 22-mer primer strand
is quickly extended by two nucleotides up to the
nucleotide opposite the template base ﬂanking the
adduct [BP]G on the 30 side. Insertion of the nucleotide
opposite [BP]G is slowed but is almost complete (90%)
after a 30min reaction time (Figure 2b). In contrast,
further extension of the primer strand beyond the [BP]G
adduct on the template strand is signiﬁcantly inhibited.
Nevertheless, a small amount of full extension (1%) to a
43-mer is also observed after an incubation time of 30min.
It is evident from Figure 2b that the incorporation of a
dNTP opposite the lesion is signiﬁcantly more eﬀective
than primer extension beyond the lesion site.
In order to determine which 20-deoxyribonucleotides are
incorporated opposite [BP]G in the current sequence
context, standing-start single nucleotide insertion assays
were carried out using a 24-mer primer strand with its
30-terminal base paired with the template base ﬂanking
[BP]G on the 30-side. The experimental conditions were
adjusted in order to limit the incorporation of nucleotides
to510%. At a [DNA]/[Enzyme] ratio of 7.5 employed in
these experiments, it is evident that purines rather than
pyrimidines are preferentially inserted opposite [BP]G
(Figure 2c, and Supplementary Data). The steady-state
kcat and Km Michaelis-Menten parameters, determined for
dATP and dGTP insertion opposite [BP]G (Figure S4),
are summarized in Table S3. The values of the insertion
eﬃciencies fins= kcat/Km are 7000 and 20 000 times
smaller, respectively, than the value of insertion of the
normal dCTP opposite an unmodiﬁed G template base in
the same sequence context (Table S3).
In order to investigate the structural basis of these
observations, especially the relatively facile insertion of
dNTP opposite the lesion, and the strong inhibition of
primer extension beyond the lesion, we constructed initial
models with anti- and syn-[BP]G at (i) the pre-insertion
site of open BF; (ii) the insertion site of closed BF; (iii) the
post-insertion site of open BF; and (iv) the post-insertion
site of closed BF. These are four consecutive steps as
[BP]G advances through the active site of BF (Figure 3a).
For studies of mismatched dNTP insertion, we considered
only the syn-[BP]G case, based on our modeling results
that anti-[BP]G would be totally blocking irrespective
of the incoming dNTP. The models were subjected to 2 ns
of MD following equilibration, and achieved stability
after 800 ps (Figure S3). The structures, after MD,
are shown in Figures 4, S5 and S6, and analyses of the
trajectory ensembles are provided in Tables S4–S11 and
Figures S7–S11.

Structural analyses
The structural properties relevant to polymerase function
were analyzed in each case in the presence of the [BP]G
lesion and compared to the corresponding unmodiﬁed
control. We chose structural and geometric features of the
active site region of the binary polymerase-DNA and
ternary polymerase-DNA-dNTP complexes deemed
important for faithful and eﬃcient catalysis (35,59,60).
Our hypothesis is that distortions to the correct alignment,
as observed with unmodiﬁed templates, impede or slow
polymerase activity. The structural characteristics of the
active site we examined are: (i) the width of the pre-
insertion site (Figure S7 and Table S4) at Steps 1 and 3
(the open binary complex): the pre-insertion site is open
and occupied by the next-to-be-replicated base in the
binary complex, but is blocked by a polypeptide
loop in the closed ternary complex (35); (ii) the number
and occupancies of the hydrogen bonds in the
[BP]G-containing base pair (Figure S8) and its
neighboring base pairs; hydrogen bond occupancies are
the percent of time during the stable region of the MD
trajectory (0.8–2.0 ns) that the hydrogen bond is
present according to the following criteria: 3.3 A˚ between
heavy atoms (donor and acceptor) and a hydrogen
bonding donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle of 1358; speciﬁ-
cally, we monitored the hydrogen bonds at the +1 base
pair at Step 1; 0 and +1 base pairs at Step 2; +1 and +2
base pairs at Step 3; and 0, +1 and +2 base pairs at Step
4 (Figure 3b and Table S5); (iii) the stacking interaction
between Tyr-714 and the templating base at the post-
insertion site (Figure 4) at Steps 1 and 3 (the binary
complex): Tyr-714 blocks the insertion site and stacks with
the template base at the post-insertion site in the binary
complex, but this stacking interaction is not present in the
ternary complex (35); (iv) base stacking interactions in the
nascent base pair and the DNA duplex region around
the [BP]G (Figure 4); (v) minor groove interactions at the

Step 1. [BP]G at the pre-insertion site of open BF: anti-
[BP]G seriously disturbs the pre-insertion site, while syn-
[BP]G does not. When the BP modiﬁed dG adopts the
normal anti conformation as in the unmodiﬁed control,
the BP moiety is deeply imbedded in the pre-insertion site
(Figure 4b), signiﬁcantly enlarging its width (43 A˚) as
compared to the unmodiﬁed control (Table S4). However,
when the adducted dG adopts the less common syn
conformation, the BP is out of the pre-insertion site and
the base remains accommodated there (Figure 4c); thus
the pre-insertion site width is unaﬀected (Table S4). The
adduct at the pre-insertion site, whether anti or syn, does
not aﬀect Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding of the +1G:C
pair (Figure 3b and Table S5). In addition, the following
structural features are also not aﬀected signiﬁcantly:
stacking between Tyr-714 and the base at the post-
insertion site (Figure 4b and c), base stacking in the DNA
duplex region (Figure 4b and c), minor groove contacts at
the post-insertion site (Figure 3b and Table S6), the
nucleotide binding pocket and the width of the post-
insertion site (Table S7).

anti-[BP]G:dCTP minor groove. The presence of BP on
the minor groove side disrupts the important minor
groove interaction on the template side (hydrogen bond
occupancy of only 1%) (Figure 3b and Table S6). The BP
also signiﬁcantly enlarges the height of the active site on
the template side (Table S9) and pushes the template to
the side part of the active site wall (Tyr-714 and Gly-715)
away from close contact with the modiﬁed guanine
(Figure 5c). While the anti modiﬁed dG forms three
hydrogen bonds with its partner, dCTP (Figure S8b), one
hydrogen bond has reduced occupancy by 30% as
compared to the control (Table S5).
However, other active site features are near normal as
compared to the unmodiﬁed control: stacking of the
modiﬁed guanine with its neighbor (Figure 4e), hydrogen
bonding in the +1G:C pair (Table S5), the post-insertion
site width (Table S7), protein-dNTP interactions
(Table S8), the Pa-O30 distance and in-line attack angle
(Figure S9 and Table S10), and the distance between the
two Mg2+ ions and their octahedral coordination
(Table S11). These well-preserved properties are necessary
but not suﬃcient for eﬃcient chemical catalysis, and
disturbance to the minor groove contacts and active site
pocket suggests impeded enzymatic activity.

syn-[BP]G:dA/C/G/TTP major groove. The two impor-
tant hydrogen bonds between the +1 base pair and Arg-
615 and Gln-797 on the minor groove side (Figure 3b) are
maintained for the four diﬀerent dNTPs (Table S6). The
hydrogen bonds between protein residues and the dNTP
have similar occupancies in the unmodiﬁed control, except
for the hydrogen bond between Lys-706 and O1g of dNTP
in the syn-[BP]G:dGTP case (occupancy 60% lower than
unmodiﬁed) (Table S8). The four amino acids comprising
the active site wall are tightly wrapped around the nascent
base pair, as in the unmodiﬁed control. The width and
height of the active site are nearly normal (increased by
less than 1 A˚) (Table S9). The Pa-O30 distance, in-line
attack angle, distance between the two Mg2+ ions and
their coordination are normal in all systems (Figure S9,
Tables S10 and S11).
The syn-[BP]G adduct has one hydrogen bond with
dATP (occupancy 73%), one hydrogen bond with dCTP
(occupancy 96%), and two hydrogen bonds with dGTP
(occupancies 99% and 73%, respectively), all formed
during MD equilibration. The syn-[BP]G:dTTP initial
model contains no hydrogen bond between the adducted
dG and dTTP and none is formed during MD
(Figure S8c–f and Table S5). The three hydrogen bonds
in the +1G:C Watson-Crick pair are maintained in all
systems except in the case of syn-[BP]G:dCTP. In this
case, the occupancy of the hydrogen bond between the
amino group of G and O2 of C is decreased by 30% as
compared to the unmodiﬁed control (Table S5), because
the C plane in dCTP is almost perpendicular to that of this
primer terminal C (Figure 4g). The single hydrogen bond
between syn-[BP]G and dCTP is directly opposite the
glycosidic bond axis and the active site holds the base pair
loosely, allowing relatively free rotation of the C about the
 torsion angle. The syn adducted dG stacks poorly with
its neighboring base on the 30 side in the four major groove
adduct systems (Figure 4f–i).

anti-[BP]G:dC minor groove. We simulated three
minor groove adduct models at this step, two
computer-generated models (anti-1-[BP]G:dC and anti-
2-[BP]G:dC), and one crystal structure (PDB ID:
1XC9) (44) (anti-3-[BP]G:dC) (see MATERIALS AND
METHODS). The BP orientation in the anti-1-[BP]G:dC
initial model is similar to that in the crystal structure (the
anti-3-[BP]G:dC initial model); the BP in both structures
overlaps with the nucleotide binding pocket. However, in
the anti-2-[BP]G:dC initial model, the BP is oriented
diﬀerently, pointing toward the single stranded region of
the template and away from the nucleotide binding pocket
(Figure 6a). Following MD, the BP orientation in the anti-
1-[BP]G:dC and anti-3-[BP]G:dC systems remains essen-
tially unchanged, with the nucleotide binding pocket still
blocked by the BP. In the anti-2-[BP]G:dC system, the BP
reorients so that it is closer to the position in the anti-1-
[BP]G:dC and anti-3-[BP]G:dC systems, where it would
collide with the incoming dNTP if BF were to close
(Figure 6b). However, the amino acid residues, Ile-657,
Glu-658 and Val-713 constitute a barrier preventing
convergence of the BP orientation in this anti-2-
[BP]G:dC system with the other two systems
(Figure 6c). The RMSDs of the active site regions in the
three systems, compared to the crystal structure, are 2.9 A˚,
2.5 A˚ and 1.5 A˚, respectively. Minor groove contacts at the
post-insertion site are blocked in all three systems with the
BP on the minor groove side (Table S6). However, the BP
does not aﬀect the width of the pre-insertion and post-
insertion sites (Tables S4 and S7), or the hydrogen bonds
in the +1 and +2 base pairs (Figure S8h-j and Table S5).
The base stacking interactions in the DNA duplex are
preserved due to the anti conformation of the modiﬁed
dG (Figure 4k–m). The stacking interaction between the
Tyr-714 and the modiﬁed guanine in the post-insertion
site, absent in the original crystal structure (44), remains
absent in the anti-3-[BP]G:dC system, based on the
crystal (Figure 4m); it is lost in the anti-1-[BP]G:dC
system (Figure 4k) following dynamics, but remains
present in the anti-2-[BP]G:dC system (Figure 4l).
Overall, the three simulated models generally reproduce
structural properties in the crystal, but with anti-2-
[BP]G:dC displaying a shifted minor groove BP
orientation.
syn-[BP]G:dA/C/G/T major groove. The BP on the
major groove side is too far from the nucleotide binding
pocket to block it. However, the syn modiﬁed dG stacks
poorly with the Tyr-714 and the base on the 30-side
(Figure 4n–q); also, it cannot hydrogen bond with the
Gln-797 (Table S6), since N3 of the guanine is now on the
major groove side. The syn-[BP]G forms one hydrogen
bond with dA (occupancy 71%), one hydrogen bond with
dC (occupancy 24%) and two hydrogen bonds with dG
(occupancies 32% and 77%, respectively) during MD
equilibration, but there is no hydrogen bond between syn-
[BP]G and dT (Figure S8k–n and Table S5). The BP does
not alter the minor groove contact between the primer
terminal base and the Arg-615 (Table S6), the hydrogen
bonds in the +2G:C pair (Table S5), or the pre- and post-
insertion site widths (Tables S4 and S7) in the four
systems.

anti-[BP]G:dC minor groove. To avoid steric clashes
between the benzylic ring of the BP and the Watson-
Crick edge of the modiﬁed guanine, this edge was 50-tilted
by the ring. Also, the Watson-Crick edge of the partner C
was 30-tilted via a hydrogen bond between O2 of the C and
O8 of the BP benzylic ring (Figure 4s). Consequently,
Watson-Crick pairing between the bases is impaired, with
two hydrogen bonds essentially broken and the third
signiﬁcantly weakened (Figure S8p and Table S5). In
addition, the stacking interactions between the modiﬁed
guanine and its neighboring bases as well as those between
the partner C and its neighboring bases are diminished,
and the post-insertion site width is signiﬁcantly enlarged
(by41 A˚) (Table S7). The BP blocks the minor groove

contacts not only between the modiﬁed dG and Gln-797,
but also between the partner C of [BP]G and Arg-615
(Table S6). The hydrogen bonds stabilizing the dNTP
binding have similar occupancies in the modiﬁed system as
in the unmodiﬁed case, except for the bond between Glu-
658 and O30 of dNTP, which is lost (Table S8). The anti-
[BP]G in the post-insertion site does not aﬀect the active
site width and height (Table S9), the positioning of the
active site wall, or the hydrogen bonds in the neighboring
0 and +2 base pairs (Table S5). The Pa-O3’ distance,
in-line attack angle, distance between the two Mg2+ ions
and their coordination are normal in this system

syn-[BP]G:dA/C/G/T major groove. The syn-[BP]G
forms, during MD equilibration, one hydrogen bond
with dA (occupancy 88%), one hydrogen bond with dC
(occupancy 74%), two hydrogen bonds with dG (occu-
pancies 84% and 100%, respectively) and one hydrogen
bond with dT (occupancy 88%) (Figure S8q–t and
Table S5). In the syn-[BP]G:dA/dC/dT systems, the
base of the modiﬁed dG is tilted to avoid steric clashes
between its own phosphate group and the benzylic ring of
the BP moiety (Figure 4t, u and w). As a result, the
adducted guanine stacks poorly with both its 50- and
30- neighboring bases, and the height of the active site on
the template side is signiﬁcantly increased (Figure 5d and
Table S9). However, the two hydrogen bonds between
[BP]G and dG hold the bases co-planar in the
syn-[BP]G:dG system, so that the modiﬁed guanine is
not tilted. The phosphate of the modiﬁed dG is slightly
pushed away from the primer strand to make room for the
[BP]G adduct (Figure 4v). As a result, the adducted
guanine partially stacks with its neighbors on both 50- and
30-sides, although less than in the anti dG unmodiﬁed
control, and the active site height on the template side is
normal (Table S9).
The active site height on the primer side is normal in
the syn-[BP]G:dA/dG/dT systems. However, it is signiﬁ-
cantly increased in the syn-[BP]G:dC system (Table S9),
because of an unstable orientation of the plane of the
C opposite [BP]G throughout the MD simulation
(Figure S10). At times, the C rotates around the glycosidic
bond by4 308 so that the C6-containing major groove-
side edge rolls toward the 50-end of the primer (Figure 5d).
Thus, the height on the primer side, namely the distance
between C6 of dC and Ca of Lys-706, is signiﬁcantly
increased.
The N3 of the syn modiﬁed dG, on the major groove
side, cannot hydrogen bond with Gln-797 regardless of the
partner base (Table S6). The width of the post-insertion
site in the syn-[BP]G:dA and syn-[BP]G:dC systems is
similar to that in the control, but is signiﬁcantly increased
in the syn-[BP]G:dG systems and decreased in the syn-
[BP]G:dT system (Table S7). The BP residue does not
aﬀect the hydrogen bonds in the 0 and +2 base pairs
(Table S5), the active site width (Table S9) or the
interactions between amino acids and dNTP (Table S8)
in the four systems. The Pa-O30 distance, in-line attack
angle, distance between the two Mg2+ ions and their
coordination, are normal in all systems (Figure S9,
Tables S10 and S11).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have carried out a computational
study, based on key experimental observations, to
investigate how the bulky [BP]G adduct is processed
during DNA replication by the polymerase BF. Primer
extension and single nucleotide insertion assays reveal that
the [BP]G lesion allows slow incorporation of purine
dNTPs when these are paired with the modiﬁed guanine
on the template strand, but that further extension is
strongly inhibited. To account for these observations, we
have constructed two sets of initial models with
BP-modiﬁed dG in the normal anti and the less prevalent
syn conformations. The syn conformation has
been observed experimentally by solution NMR methods
in the case of an unpaired guanine residue of the
(+)-trans-[BP]G adduct positioned at a template-primer
junction (10,64), revealing that the syn conformation is
feasible in such structures. We have investigated four
consecutive steps in DNA replication as [BP]G transits
through the BF active site region, with polymerase open
and closed, in binary and ternary complexes (Figure 3a).
MD simulations were carried out and important
structural properties were analyzed in detail and com-
pared to the unmodiﬁed control. The MD results
structurally interpret our experimental data and are
consistent with the available crystal structure (44). We
hypothesize that increased distortions at the polymerase
active site are a hallmark of reduced polymerase ﬁdelity
and eﬃciency. The distortions for each property were
scored, and a composite score was derived for each system
(Table 1). A numerically more negative score indicates a
more distorted structure. The properties evaluated and the
scoring criteria employed were selected based on our
current best understanding of proper active site geometry.
A recent crystal structure reveals a well-organized active
site (59), whose features closely resemble those in our
unmodiﬁed models, suggesting that our criteria for
evaluating distortions are reasonable. However, the
scoring function is an evolving one which is being
improved as our knowledge base advances. At this stage,
the composite scores reﬂect the degrees of distortion, but
the relationship between the scores and the biological
outcome is very likely non-linear.
The anti-[BP]G adduct structures are consistent with total
blockage while the syn-[BP]G adducts should allow some
bypass
The anti-[BP]G adduct causes severe distortions to the
BF-DNA complex structures at any of the four steps
investigated. At Step 1 (Figure 3a), anti-[BP]G cannot be
accommodated in the pre-insertion site without signiﬁ-
cantly enlarging this site. This is consistent with the
partially resolved crystal structure with the BP-modiﬁed
guanine as the base next to be replicated: the adduct itself
is disordered and not positioned in the pre-insertion site
(44); the BP modiﬁed dG adduct most likely adopts the

preferred anti conformation, and therefore cannot ﬁt into
the normal-sized pre-insertion site. At Step 2, the adduct is
situated on the minor groove side of the nascent base pair.
It disturbs the minor groove scanning track and the active
site pocket. The three simulations with anti-[BP]G at
Step 3 reveal structures that have impaired minor groove
contacts and impeded nucleotide binding characteristics,
quite like the published crystal structure (44) (which
provided one of the three initial models). At Step 4, the BP
blocks the minor groove interactions and disrupts the
primer terminal base pair. These distortions suggest that
the anti-[BP]dG should be totally blocking at any of the
four steps.
The syn-[BP]G disturbs the BF-DNA structure less
severely than the anti adduct. At Step 1, the syn-[BP]G
appears to have negligible eﬀect on the BF-DNA
structure; the modiﬁed dG residue can be accommodated
in the pre-insertion site whose shape is preserved. Starting
from Step 2, the BP ring system is positioned on the open
major groove side of the DNA duplex where it does not
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the minor groove contacts
between the DNA and the polymerase. Nor does the
[BP]G adduct in the syn conformation impair the active
site pocket at Step 2. Therefore, the syn conformation
should allow some bypass. However, the syn adduct
distorts other structural properties such as the hydrogen
bonding geometry of the [BP]G-containing base pair and
the base stacking interactions, suggesting that polymerase
stalling would be prevalent at Steps 2, 3 and 4 (Figure 3a).
In a cellular environment, the polymerase would probably
stall for a suﬃciently long time to allow dissociation.
Therefore, a switch to one or more bypass polymerases
would likely occur, allowing for possibly error-prone
translesion bypass (25–31). The major groove/syn orienta-
tion of the [BP]G adduct for bypass in the Pol I family
may be a general theme for this replicative polymerase
family; the large open pocket can readily house the bulky
adduct in both T7 (50–52) and BF.
The experimental running-start primer extension results
(Figure 2a and b) reveal that BF catalyzes the reaction in a
quick and eﬃcient manner up to the position right before
the lesion site, but further dNTP incorporation is
signiﬁcantly slowed. This is consistent with our modeling
studies which suggest that the syn conformation allows
for some translesion bypass. Although the syn-[BP]G
adduct at the pre-insertion site (Step 1) does not seem
to aﬀect polymerase structure (Table 1), a slowing of
the reaction kinetics may be due to the less prevalent
occurrence of the [BP]G in the syn conformation.
We note that a conformational rearrangement between
syn and anti might take place within the enzyme during
a given replication cycle, as observed in BF with
another carcinogen-guanine adduct. In a crystal of
N-(20-deoxyguanosin-8yl)-aminoﬂuorene ([AF]G) in BF,
the aminoﬂuorene (AF)-modiﬁed dG was syn at the pre-
insertion site of open BF; after one round of replication
within the crystal, the modiﬁed dG moved to the post-
insertion site of open BF where it was anti (65). In general,
the opportunity for a syn-anti or some other rearrange-
ment within the polymerase can explain the possibility for
slow bypass past a particularly situated lesion, even in the
face of signiﬁcant distortion. In the case of mismatch
structures in BF, a templating base which failed to be
housed in the pre-insertion site could still be slowly
extended (66), indicating a necessary rearrangement to
permit further nucleotide incorporation.
Purine over pyrimidine insertion is favored opposite the lesion
Our MD results show that the purine partners causes less
distortion opposite the syn-[BP]G than pyrimidines
(Table 1). The purines are more comfortably situated
opposite the syn modiﬁed guanine, whose shape in the
active site is pyrimidine-like (Figure 7). The pseudo
pyrimidine–pyrimidine pair ﬁts poorly in the active site,
with the greatest disturbances involving hydrogen bond-
ing/stacking interactions (Table 1). This is consistent with
the experimentally observed favored insertion of purines
opposite the [BP]G adduct in the present study
(Figure 2c). In contrast to our ﬁndings that purines are
preferentially inserted opposite G in the CGG sequence
context, Hsu et al. (44) reported that dCTP is preferen-
tially inserted opposite G in a CGC sequence context. In
general, we ﬁnd that base sequence eﬀects can have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on dNTP insertion selectivities,
eﬃciencies and translesion bypass. The DNA sequences
used in our work and that of Hsu et al. are diﬀerent, which
can account for the diﬀerent insertion selectivities. These
are issues that are at the forefront of our interests and are
presently under investigation in our laboratories.
Extension beyond the [BP]G is more impeded than insertion
opposite this adduct
Because of diﬀering structural properties, diﬀerent scoring
criteria had to be employed for the ternary and binary
complexes. Hence, comparison can only be made between
Steps 1 and 3 (binary complexes), and between Steps 2 and
4 (ternary complexes). Table 1 shows the distortion scores.
A comparison between Step 1 (pre-insertion step) and
Step 3 (pre-extension step) (Figure 3a) indicates that the
structure is less perturbed at the pre-insertion step than

at the pre-extension step, suggesting that it would be easier
to proceed to the insertion than the extension step. In
addition, a comparison of Step 2 (insertion step) and Step
4 (extension step) (Figure 3a) shows that the structures are
more distorted during extension than during insertion for
all partners opposite the adduct. The syn-[BP]G generally
interferes with stacking interactions and minor groove
contacts more severely at the pre-extension/extension step
than at the pre-insertion/insertion step. These conclusions
are consistent with the experimental results since nucleo-
tide incorporation opposite [BP]G is indeed more
probable than extension beyond this adduct. This has
been generally found to be the case for the [BP]G adduct
in Pol I type polymerases (14,67–69).
Most of the intermediates investigated by modeling
have not been characterized experimentally with the
[BP]G adduct; hence modeling provides the only
approach to gaining structure-function understanding of
the experimental results. An added advantage of the MD
is the dynamic ensemble of structures provided, which
cannot be realized experimentally. We note the on-going
frontier problems in MD simulations, which are limited by
the problem of sampling suﬃciency, together with issues
relating to force ﬁeld quality (70–72). It is encouraging
that our simulations involving a structure already
characterized crystallographically essentially converged
with the crystal structure, from a modeled initial position
obtained by the same criteria as were the unknown
structures.
CONCLUSIONS
Our experimental data show that BF is primarily blocked
by the [BP]G adduct, although a low extent of lesion
bypass with full primer extension is also detected;
however, nucleotide incorporation opposite [BP]G is
observed with signiﬁcantly greater eﬃciency, with purines
favored over pyrimidines. Further extension beyond the
lesion site is more strongly inhibited than insertion. The
results of our structural modeling studies elucidate
structural bases for these experimental observations. Our
MD simulations show that when BP modiﬁed dG adopts
the normal anti conformation at any of the four steps of
primer extension investigated, the adduct causes severe
distortion to the polymerase structure and thus should
totally block nucleotide incorporation/extension. On the
other hand, the less prevalent syn conformation of the
adducted dG produces a less distorted polymerase
structure, thus explaining how some translesion bypass
might occur; however, certain structural disturbances
nevertheless suggest that the polymerase would be
impeded. When the adducted dG is in the insertion site
of the closed BF and adopts the syn conformation, the
purine partners are better accommodated opposite the
adduct than pyrimidines, accounting for the preferential
insertion of purines; the resulting G:A and G:G mis-
matches cause G!T and G!C transversion mutations.
Furthermore, our MD results show that the adduct
disturbs the correct alignment of the active site region
more severely at the extension/pre-extension step than at
the insertion/pre-insertion step, explaining why extension
is more diﬃcult than the successful incorporation of a
dNTP opposite the lesion.
