ABSTRACT
The synthesis of the triphosphates of 40-thiouridine
and 40-thiocytidine, 40-thioUTP (7; thioUTP) and
40-thioCTP (8; thioCTP), and their utility for SELEX
(systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment) is described. The new nucleoside tri-
phosphate (NTP) analogs 7 and 8 were prepared from
appropriately protected 40-thiouridine and -cytidine
derivatives using the one-pot method reported by
J. Ludwig and F. Eckstein [(1989) J. Org. Chem., 54,
631–635]. Because SELEX requires both in vitro tran-
scription and reverse transcription, we examined the
ability of 7 and 8 for SELEX by focusing on the two
steps. Incorporation of 7 and 8 by T7 RNA polymerase
to give 40-thioRNA (thioRNA) proceeded well and was
superior to those of the two sets of frequently used
modified NTP analogs for SELEX (20-NH2dUTP and 20-
NH2dCTP;2
0-FdUTP and 20-FdCTP), when an adequate
leader sequence of DNA template was selected. We
revealed that a leader sequence of about +15 of DNA
template is important for the effective incorporation of
modified NTP analogs by T7 RNA polymerase. In addi-
tion, reverse transcription of the resulting thioRNA
into the complementary DNA in the presence of 20-
deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) also pro-
ceeded smoothly and precisely. The stability of the
thioRNA toward RNase A was 50 times greater than
that of the corresponding natural RNA. With these
successful results inhand,weattemptedtheselection
of thioRNA aptamers to human a-thrombin using
thioUTP and thioCTP, and found a thioRNA aptamer
with high binding affinity (Kd = 4.7 nM).
INTRODUCTION
SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment) is a biotechnological method used for isolating
functional RNA molecules, such as ribozymes and aptamers
from a random pool of RNA combinatorial libraries (1–3).
This innovative technology has already been successfully
employed to isolate a number of ribozymes and aptamers.
Ribozymes, RNA molecules that catalyze not only biological
processes, such as RNA cleavage and ligation but also organic
reactions, including the Diels–Alder reaction and hydrolysis of
esters, were isolated (4–6). Aptamers have also been obtained
for a variety of target molecules, e.g. nucleotides, amino acids
and proteins using SELEX (7–9). Since the resulting aptamers,
such as antibodies, show a potent and selective binding affinity
for the target molecule, they are expected to become not only
useful biological tools, but also diagnostic and therapeutic
agents (10,11). In addition, given the ease of chemical modi-
fication of aptamers consisting of nucleic acids rather than
proteins, it is not surprising that applications such as bio-
sensors and ligands in affinity probe capillary electrophoresis
have also been reported (12,13). For these reasons, isolation of
functional RNA molecules using SELEX has gained increas-
ing attention. However, because it is generally acknowledged
that RNA is a transient molecule in biological fluids, stabil-
ization of functional RNA molecules toward nuclease diges-
tion would be required for their versatile use and application.
Until now, three methods have been devised to improve the
stability of RNA molecules obtained using SELEX. Nolte et al.
(14) have reported a mirror-design RNA aptamer, which con-
sists of selecting an RNA aptamer against the enantiomer of
the target molecule, the mirror image of the target, by using
standard SELEX. When the resulting RNA aptamer (D-RNA)
was converted to L-RNA with the same sequence context, the
L-RNA exhibited high binding affinity to the target molecule
and high stability against nuclease digestion. Although this

concept would appear to be an intriguing idea, the preparation
of the phosphoramidite units of L-nucleosides is required.
Furthermore, this strategy is limited to cases where an enan-
tiomer of the target molecule is available. The second method
for the stabilization of functional RNA molecules is a post-
modification, which consists of a chemical modification of the
RNA molecules by phosphoramidite units, such as 20-O-
methyl derivatives. However, this strategy causes structural
changes of the RNA molecules and often results in loss of
ribozyme and RNA aptamer activity (15). The third method
uses SELEX to isolate the stable RNA molecules by employ-
ing modified nucleoside triphosphates, which arguably is a
more reliable strategy. However, recognition of the nucleoside
triphosphates by the T7 RNA polymerase is quite restrictive,
and few of the modified triphosphates are considered good
candidates for SELEX. Thus far, 20-modified-20-deoxynuc-
leoside 50-triphosphates (16), nucleoside 50-(a-P-borano)tri-
phosphates (17) and nucleoside 50-(a-thio)triphosphates
(18) are used as modified triphosphates for SELEX. Among
them, 20-amino- and 20-fluoro-20-deoxypyrimidine nucleoside
triphosphates (20-NH2dUTP and 20-NH2dCTP; 20-FdUTP and
20-FdCTP) are frequently used compounds, and a number of
nuclease-resistant RNAs, especially RNA aptamers, were isol-
ated by SELEX using these two sets of 50-triphosphates.
On the other hand, 40-thioribonucleoside is a nucleoside
analog possessing a sulfur atom instead of the furanose
ring oxygen. We have already reported an effective and
stereoselective synthesis of 40-thioribonucleosides (19–21).
Furthermore, it was revealed that RNAs consisting of 40-
thioribonucleosides exhibit an enhancement of thermal stabil-
ity and nuclease resistance (22,23). Because the RNAs con-
sisting of 40-thioribonucleosides possess 20-OH groups, a
distinctive characteristic of RNA, which would contribute to
the catalytic activity and diversity of the tertiary structure and
of the interaction with the target molecules, we were prompted
to prepare 40-thioribonucleoside 50-triphosphates and investig-
ate whether the 50-triphosphates are applicable to the SELEX
process. Although the synthesis of 5-ethyl-20-deoxy-40-thiour-
idine 50-triphosphate and its substrate properties for DNA syn-
thesizing enzymes, such as DNA polymerase a and reverse
transcriptases, have been reported previously (24), there is no
literature precedent for a series of 40-thioribonucleosides. Here,
we describe the synthesis of the new nucleoside triphosphates,
40-thioUTP (7; thioUTP) and 40-thioCTP (8; thioCTP) and their
utility for SELEX. The 50-triphosphates obtained were effect-
ively incorporated into RNA by T7 RNA polymerase to give
40-thioRNA (thioRNA; in this paper, thioRNA indicates an
RNA molecule containing 40-thiouridine and 40-thiocytidine
units. Similarly, aminoRNA and fluoroRNA indicate RNA
molecules containing 20-amino- and 20-fluoro-20-deoxypyrimi-
dine nucleoside units.). The resulting thioRNA was then con-
verted into complementary DNA without misincorporation by
reverse transcriptase in the presence of dNTPs. Selection of
thioRNA aptamers to human a-thrombin is also described.

1-[5-O-(4-Methoxytrityl)-2,3-di-O-acetyl-4-thio-b-D-
ribofuranosyl]uracil (3)
To a solution of 1 (131 mg, 0.5 mmol) in pyridine (4 ml)
was added 4-methoxytrityl chloride (232 mg, 0.75 mmol),
and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature.
After 14 h, acetic anhydride (188 ml, 2.0 mmol) and 4-
(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) (5 mg, 0.05 mmol) was
added to the reaction mixture and being stirred for additional
2 h at the same temperature. The reaction was quenched by the
addition of methanol, and the solvent was removed in vacuo.
The residue was dissolved in AcOEt, and the organic solution
was washed with H2O, saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine.
The separated organic layer was dried (Na2SO4) and concen-
trated in vacuo. The residue was purified by a silica gel col-
umn, eluted with hexane/AcOEt (2:1–1:1) to give 3 (214 mg,
70%), as a colorless glass.
1-(2,3-Di-O-acetyl-4-thio-b-D-ribofuranosyl)uracil (5)
A solution of 3 (199 mg, 0.32 mmol) in 80% aqueous acetic
acid (3 ml) was stirred for 11 h at room temperature. The
reaction mixture was partitioned between CHCl3 and saturated
aqueous NaHCO3. The organic layer was washed with satur-
ated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine. The separated organic layer
was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue
was purified by a silica gel column, eluted with hexane/AcOEt
(2:1–0:1) to give 5 (93 mg, 84%), as a white foam.
40-Thiouridine 50-triphosphate (7)
To a solution of 5 (89 mg, 0.26 mmol) in pyridine–DMF
(260–780 ml) was added a freshly prepared 1 M solution of
2-chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one in dioxane
(290 ml, 0.29 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room

temperature. After 10 min, a 0.5 M solution of bis(tri-n-butyl-
ammonium)pyrophosphate in DMF (780 ml, 0.39 mmol) and
tri-n-butylamine (278 ml, 1.17 mmol) was quickly added. The
reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 10 min, and a
solution of 1% iodine in pyridine/H2O (98/2, v/v) (5 ml) was
added. After 30 min, the excess iodine was destroyed by add-
ing a few drops of a 5% aqueous NaHSO3 followed by ammo-
nium hydroxide (28%, 8 ml). After 3.5 h, the solvent was
removed in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in H2O
(300 ml). The solution was applied to a DEAE Sephadex
column, which was eluted with a linear gradient of 1 liter
each of H2O and 1 M TEAB buffer. The fractions containing
the desired triphosphate were collected, concentrated and
coevaporated with H2O. The residue was dissolved in H2O
(5 ml), and the solution was passed through ion-exchange
resins DIAION PK212 (H+ form) and DIAION WK
20 (Na+ form) to give 7 as a trisodium salt (80 mg, 55%).
N4-Benzoyl-1-[5-O-(4-methoxytrityl)-2,3-di-O-acetyl-4-
thio-b-D-ribofuranosyl]cytosine (4)
In a similar manner as described for 3, 2 (25) (302 mg,
0.83 mmol) was treated with 4-methoxytrityl chloride, fol-
lowed by acetic anhydride to give 4 (579 mg, 97%), as a
white foam.
N4-Benzoyl-1-(2,3-di-O-acetyl-4-thio-b-D-
ribofuranosyl)cytosine (6)
In a similar manner as described for 5, 4 (420 mg, 0.58 mmol)
was treated with 80% aqueous acetic acid to give 6 (239 mg,
92%), as a white foam.
40-Thiocytidine 50-triphosphate (8)
In a similar manner as described for 7, 6 (71 mg, 0.16 mmol)
was successively treated with 2-chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxa-
phosphorin-4-one, bis(tri-n-butylammonium)pyrophosphate,
tri-n-butylamine, and then with ammonium hydroxide to
give 8 as a trisodium salt (68 mg, 75%).
General procedure for in vitro transcription by
T7 RNA polymerase
The in vitro transcription was performed with 40 pmol of
template DNA in 20 ml of transcription buffer. The mixture
contained either 0.4 mM of natural NTP(s) and/or modified
NTP(s), 100 U of T7 RNA polymerase in a 40 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 8.0) containing 8 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM sper-
midine, and 5 mM DTT. Reaction mixtures were incubated
at 37C. At appropriate time points, 2 ml aliquots of the reac-
tion mixture were added to 4 ml of loading buffer (50 mM
EDTA, 10 M urea, 0.1% bromophenol blue and 0.1% xylene
cyanol). The mixtures were then analyzed by electrophoresis
on 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The pre-
cursor [g-32P]GTP (10 mCi) was used when labeled transcripts
were needed.
Reverse transcription by SuperscriptTM II reverse
transcriptase
Reverse transcription was carried out using RNA59 or
thioRNA59 as templates. A 16mer of oligodeoxynucleotide
labeled with 32P at the 50 end (50-pCTGGTACCGTCACCTC-
30) was used as a primer. Reverse transcription was performed
with 20 pmol each of the template RNA and the primer
containing 2 pmol of the labeled substrate in 20 ml of tran-
scription buffer. The mixture contained 0.5 mM of four
dNTPs, 200 U of Superscript II (RNase H) in a 50 mM
Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 75 mM KCl and 3 mM
MgCl2, 40 U of RNaseOUT and 10 mM DTT. Reaction
mixtures were incubated at 42C. After 50 min, 2 ml aliquots
of the reaction mixture were added to 4 ml of the loading buffer
(50 mM EDTA, 10 M urea, 0.1% bromophenol blue and 0.1%
xylene cyanol). The mixtures were then analyzed by electro-
phoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea.
Sequencing
The complementary DNA was amplified with PCR using
primers (50-CTGGTACCGTCACCTC-30 and 50-GGGAGAA-
GGGTATCCGGA-30) and TaKaRa Ex Taq. The PCR prod-
uct was cloned using a pGEM-T Easy Vector System. The
resulting plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline-lysis
method and sequenced.
Stability toward RNase A
To test for RNase A resistance, a mixture of 5 pmol of RNA59
(or thioRNA59 and aminoRNA59) labeled with 32P at the
50 end and the corresponding unlabeled RNA (400 pmol) was
used. The RNA sample was incubated with RNase A (2 ng) in
a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3 M NaCl and
5 mM EDTA (total 40 ml) at 37C. At appropriate time points,
2 ml aliquots of the reaction mixture were added to 4 ml of
loading buffer (50 mM EDTA, 10 M urea, 0.1% bromophenol
blue and 0.1% xylene cyanol). The mixtures were then ana-
lyzed by electrophoresis on 16% polyacrylamide gel contain-
ing 7 M urea.
SELEX protocols
SELEX was carried out essentially according to reported
methods (26). Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates with
a 30 nt variable region (50-GGGAGAAGGGAAGTAACAGG-
N30-GTGAGAAGAGGTGACGGTACCAG-30; 73mer), a
forward primer (50-GCTCTAGATAATACGACTCACTAT-
AGGGAGAAGGGAAGTAACAGG-30; 45mer) and a reverse
primer (50-CTGGTACCGTCACCTCTTCTCAC-30; 23mer)
were prepared. The ssDNA templates were converted to
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by PCR with the forward
and reverse primers. The resulting DNA templates were tran-
scribed using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of thioUTP
and thioCTP, together with unmodified ATP and GTP. The
transcribed thioRNA library was purified on 12% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel. The resulting thioRNA library was dena-
tured in annealing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM
NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2) at 90
C for 3 min and allowed to cool
at 23C for 10 min before each round of selection. In addition,
the thioRNA library was counterselected by passing through a
nitrocellulose filter to remove filter-binding species. For the
first round of selection, human a-thrombin was mixed with an
equimolar amount of the thioRNA library (1000 nM:1000 nM)
in the selection buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM
NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT). After incubation at 25
C
for 10 min, the mixture was separated by filtration through
a nitrocellulose filter to collect human a-thrombin with the
thioRNAs and washed with 1 ml of the selection buffer. The
2944 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 9
thioRNAs were eluted from the filter by phenol (400 ml) and
freshly prepared 7 M urea (200 ml). Ethanol precipitation with
20 mg of glycogen was carried out and the thioRNAs recovered
were annealed to reverse primer, and reverse transcribed by
Superscript II (RNase H) at 42C for 50 min to give the
cDNAs. Following PCR amplification, the resulting dsDNA
templates were transcribed in vitro to give the thioRNA library
for the next round of selection. The concentration of the thi-
oRNA library was fixed to 1000 nM in each selection, while
that of human a-thrombin in the selection buffer was
decreased gradually in successive rounds from 1000 to 10
nM. The selection process was carried out at 25C for rounds
1–7 and at 37C for rounds 8–10 to progressively increase the
selective pressure. After 10 rounds of selection, the selected
RNA pool was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified. The
resulting DNAs were cloned and sequenced as described
above. The secondary structure predictions for the selected
aptamers were made using the Zuker RNA mfold computer
algorithm (27).
Chemical synthesis of thioRNA aptamers
The predicted thioRNA aptamers, CI-2-23 and CII-1-37, were
synthesized on an Applied Biosystem 3400 DNA synthesizer
using 40-thiouridine and -cytidine phosphoramidite units, and
commercially available phosphoramidite units of purine nuc-
leosides. The synthesis and purification of the thioRNAs were
carried out according to our previous methods (23). The struc-
ture of each thioRNA was confirmed by the measurement of
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/mass
spectrometry on a Voyager-DE pro. CI-2-23: calculated mass,
C223H273N97O150P22S7 7613.9 (M–H); observed mass, 7619.9.
CII-1-37: calculated mass, C354H434N142O244P36S16 12 203.2
(M–H); observed mass, 12 205.9.
Filter-binding assay and determination of dissociation
constant
The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kds) for the selected
aptamers were determined by using a constant amount of 50 end
labeled oligonucleotides (0.1 nM) in the selection buffer with
increasing concentrations of human a-thrombin (0.1 to 111 or
333 nM). After incubation at 37C for 5 min, the mixture was
passed through a nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was imme-
diately washed with 1 ml of selection buffer. Radioactivity
retained on the filter was quantified using a Bio-imaging ana-
lyzer and evaluated by calculating the percentage of the input
oligonucleotides retained on each nitrocellulose filter in com-
plexes with protein. The data points were fitted to a Scatchard
plot to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant by
PRISM.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Synthesis of thioUTP and thioCTP
As mentioned in the introduction, one example of the 50-
triphosphate synthesis of 40-thionucleoside derivative has
been reported by Alexandrova et al. (24). Because the initial
monophosphorylation of 40-thionucleoside derivative by
the standard method [POCl3, (MeO)3P=O] did not take
place because of the formation of bicyclic episulfonium
intermediate (28), the desired triphosphate was prepared in
a lengthy route with low yield. Therefore, we sought a
more practical method. Ludwig and Eckstein (29) reported
an efficient one-pot synthesis of nucleoside 50-triphosphate
starting with an appropriately protected nucleoside using 2-
chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one. This method
was examined for the synthesis of 7 and 8 (Scheme 1). 40-
Thiouridine (1) was first converted to protected derivative 3 by
treatment with 4-methoxytrityl chloride (MMTrCl), followed
by acetic anhydride in pyridine. The MMTr group of 3 was
then removed by treatment with 80% aqueous acetic acid to
give 5, a substrate for subsequent phosphitylation reaction. In
the same manner, N4-benzoyl-40-thiocytidine (2) (25) was con-
verted into 20,30-di-O-acetyl derivative 6. Because the one-pot
50-triphosphate synthesis requires oxidation step of the cyclo-
triphosphite intermediate, 5 was treated under the oxidative
conditions (1% iodine in pyridine–H2O) before the 5
0-triphos-
phate synthesis. Consequently, the sulfur atom of 5 was res-
istant under the oxidative conditions (data not shown). Thus,
5 was treated with 2-chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-
4-one, followed by bis(tri-n-butylammonium)pyrophosphate
to give the cyclotriphosphite intermediate. The resulting inter-
mediate was then oxidized by 1% iodine in pyridine–H2O, and
successive treatment with NH4OH to give the desired thioUTP
(7) in 55% yield after a DEAE Sephadex column chromato-
graphic purification. In the same manner, 8 was also prepared
from 6 in 75% yield by the one-pot reaction.
Transcription by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence
of thioUTP and thioCTP
To conduct the SELEX strategy, it is necessary to determine
whether in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase in the
Scheme 1. (a) MMTrCl, pyridine then Ac2O, DMAP; (b) 80% aq. AcOH; (c) 2-
chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one, pyridine–DMF; (d) bis(tri-n-
butylammonium)pyrophosphate in DMF, Bu3N; (e) 1% iodine in pyridine–
H2O then NH4OH.

presence of modified NTP analogs and reverse transcription of
the resulting RNA containing modified nucleoside units to the
complementary DNA proceed effectively and precisely. With
the desired 7 and 8 in hand, the in vitro transcription by T7
RNA polymerase was first examined using synthetic short
DNA templates, including the T7 promoter sequence. The
in vitro transcription experiments were performed at 37C
for 3 h in the presence of appropriate unmodified and modified
NTPs (0.4 mM each), including [g-32P]GTP using template1
(43mer) to form 26mer RNA, RNA26 (Figure 1). PAGE ana-
lysis of the experiments is shown in Figure 2. In lane 1 (+GTP),
formation of the G ladder was observed (30). In lanes 2 (+GTP
and ATP) and 3 (+GTP, ATP and CTP), the transcriptions
were stopped at the corresponding positions to form the
6mer and 9mer RNAs, respectively. In the presence of all
NTPs (lane 4), a significant amount of RNA26 was observed
along with some abortive sequences. When UTP was replaced
by thioUTP (lane 5), the transcription proceeded well and the
full-length RNA was also formed under the same conditions.
In contrast, the transcription efficiencies were drastically
decreased and a significant amount of abortive RNAs (mainly
7mer RNA) was observed when CTP was replaced by thioCTP
(lanes 6 and 7). In the presence of thioUTP, the full-length
RNA was formed with 70% of the efficiency relative to that of
the unmodified NTPs (lane 4 versus lane 5). In contrast, the
efficiency of thioCTP was only 14% (lane 4 versus lane 6). In a
combination of thioUTP and thioCTP, the efficiency to give
thioRNA26 was decreased to 11% (lane 4 versus lane 7).
Although we examined the transcription using 2- and 10-
fold concentrations of thioCTP, the efficiency did not improve
significantly (16 and 22%, respectively). One reason for the
low thioCTP incorporation compared with that of thioUTP is
perhaps due to the RNA sequence formed. Thus, in this par-
ticular RNA sequence, the first position of a uridine (U) resi-
due is at the +10 position, while that of cytidine (C) is at the
+7 position. In addition, consecutive introduction of the C
residue is required (see the sequence of RNA26). In the tran-
scription using the T7 RNA polymerase, it is known
that quenching the chain elongation to form abortive RNA
products often takes place within about the first 10 nt incor-
porated (termed the initiation phase) (31,32). This abortive
formation is especially enhanced when modified NTP(s) are
incorporated within the first 10 nt (33).
With these considerations in mind, we decided to examine
the in vitro transcription using the new DNA template2 to
form the 30mer RNA, RNA30 (Figure 1). In this case, the
initial position of the U residue incorporation is +11 and that of
C residue is at the +13 position. When the transcription was

obtained with high efficiency in the presence of not only
thioUTP but also thioCTP and a combination of thioUTP
and thioCTP (data not shown). Because the in vitro transcrip-
tion using thioUTP and thioCTP proceeded well, the transcrip-
tion efficiency of these triphosphates was then compared with
those of 20-NH2dUTP and 20-NH2dCTP, and 20-FdUTP and 20-
FdCTP, which are generally used for SELEX. The transcrip-
tion by T7 RNA polymerase was performed at 37C in the
presence of ATP, GTP and modified pyrimidine nucleoside
triphosphates (0.4 mM each), and the transcription products at
various time periods were detected using PAGE analysis. As
shown in Figure 3, a significant amount of the complete tran-
scription product thioRNA30 was observed under the condi-
tions in which UTP and CTP were replaced by thioUTP and
thioCTP, and the efficiency was almost equal to that with the
natural NTPs (lanes 3–6 versus lanes 7–10). In contrast, the
transcription efficiencies were decreased when 20-NH2dUTP
and 20-NH2dCTP, and 20-FdUTP and 20-FdCTP were used
(lanes 11–14 and 15–18). The time course of formation of
the complete transcription products (0–6 h) under various
conditions is shown in Figure 4. With thioUTP and thioCTP
as substrates, the amount of thioRNA30 was 90% of that with
the natural NTPs as substrates, whereas with 20-NH2dUTP
and 20-NH2dCTP it was 54%, to give aminoRNA30.
When 20-FdUTP and 20-FdCTP were used, the relative
efficiency decreased to only 10% giving fluoroRNA30.
The DuraScribe T7 RNA polymerase, a mutant polymerase
for effective incorporation of 20-FdUTP and 20-FdCTP, was
also examined. The relative efficiency increased to 20%
giving fluoroRNA30. In contrast, the incorporation of
thioUTP and thioCTP using this mutant polymerase was inef-
fective and the relative efficiency was decreased to <10% (data
not shown).
As mentioned above, formation of the abortive RNA pro-
ducts predominantly occurs in the initiation phase because of
an unstable ternary complex of the T7 RNA polymerase, the
template DNA and shorter RNA fragments. After synthesis of
an RNA longer than 10 nt, the polymerase reaction enters the
elongation phase to give full-length RNA without dissociation
of the ternary complex. In our reaction system using
template2, formation of the abortive RNA products was
observed not only under conditions using the modified
NTPs (lanes 7–10 and 11–14) but also under those using
the natural NTPs (lanes 3–6) to a similar extent. Drastic dif-
ferences of transcription were observed at the positions around
+11 to +15, the presumed positions of the transition from the
initiation phase to the elongation phase. Under conditions
using the natural NTPs, the transcription proceeded smoothly
until termination, although a trace amount of the abortive
products between +11 and +15 was observed. In contrast,
formation of the abortive products between +11 and +15
was critical under the conditions using modified NTPs, espe-
cially those using 20-NH2dUTP and 20-NH2dCTP. In the RNA
product formed by the transcription, consecutive introduction
of pyrimidine residues is required at the positions +13 and +14,
and this would presumably be responsible for the low effici-
ency of the transcription using 20-NH2dUTP and 20-NH2dCTP.
Under conditions using thioUTP and thioCTP, the proportion
of the abortive RNA products between +11 and +15 was smal-
ler, thus providing a higher amount of thioRNA30 than ami-
noRNA30. Although there are three consecutive positions
where pyrimidine residues can be introduced at +16 to +18
and +23 to +25 into the RNA product, formation of the abort-
ive RNA products corresponding to these positions is negli-
gible. From these results, it was revealed that thioUTP
and thioCTP are better substrates of the T7 RNA polymerase
than the 20-amino- and 20-fluoro-20-deoxypyrimidine
nucleoside triphosphates. In addition, our results showed
that a leader sequence of about +15 of the resulting RNA is

respectively). Lanes 1 and 2 are sequence marker obtained by treatment of

critical for effective incorporation of the modified pyrimidine
nucleoside triphosphates for in vitro transcription.
Reverse transcription and characterization of the
resulting complementary DNA
As described above, in vitro transcription using thioUTP and
thioCTP afforded thioRNA efficiently. Accordingly, we next
examined whether the resulting thioRNA acted as a template
for reverse transcription in the presence of natural dNTPs
to give complementary DNA. To test this function, RNA59
and thioRNA59, longer sequences for the reverse transcrip-
tion, were prepared by in vitro transcription using template3
(Figure 1). The transcription efficiencies were almost equal
for both RNA products (data not shown). After annealing
RNA59 or thioRNA59 with the labeled DNA primer (50-
pCTGGTACCGTCACCTC-30; 16mer), the reverse transcrip-
tion using Superscript II (RNase H) was carried out at 42C
for 1 h in the presence of dNTPs (0.5 mM each). As shown in
Figure 5A, the reverse transcription of thioRNA59 proceeded
smoothly and effectively, as that of RNA59, to give the 59mer
of the complementary DNA (lanes 2 and 3). To check the
accuracy of the reverse transcription, the resulting comple-
mentary DNA from thioRNA59 was amplified by PCR and
then cloned into a pGEM-T Easy Vector. Plasmids containing
the 59mer region were sequenced and compared with the
sequence of template3. The results show that in vitro
transcription using thioUTP and thioCTP, and the reverse
transcription of the resulting thioRNA as template proceeded
with high fidelity (Figure 5B).
Stability of thioRNA toward RNase A
We have already reported high stability of fully modified
thioRNA against nuclease digestion (23). The thioRNA pre-
pared in this study is not fully modified, but rather partially
modified by the 40-thiouridine and 40-thiocytidine units. There-
fore, the stability of this partially modified thioRNA toward
RNase A, the pyrimidine-specific predominant nuclease in
human serum (34), was examined. The stability was tested
with labeled thioRNA59, and compared with that of the
labeled RNA59 and aminoRNA59. The results of enzymatic
degradation by RNase A are shown in Figure 6. As shown in
Figure 6A, thioRNA59 was resistant to RNase A digestion.
More than 60% of full-length RNA was still intact after 12 h,
while under the same conditions RNA59 was completely con-
sumed within 3 h. The half-lives (t1/2 s) were estimated based
on the ratio of full-length RNA at each time point, and the t1/2
of thioRNA59 was calculated to be 1174 min, which was 50
times greater than that of RNA59 (Figure 6B). Under the same
conditions, aminoRNA59, which lacks the critical 20-OH
groups for RNA cleavage, was completely intact. Although
thioRNA59 was less stable than aminoRNA59, the higher
stability of thioRNA relative to natural RNA is worth noting.
Selection of thioRNA aptamers to human a-thrombin
using thioUTP and thioCTP
As described above, we showed that thioUTP and thioCTP can
be used for the process of SELEX. Accordingly, selection of
thioRNA aptamers using thioUTP and thioCTP was next
examined. As a target protein for SELEX, human a-thrombin
was chosen because the RNA and the DNA aptamers have
been isolated and their structures and functions have been
thoroughly investigated (26,35). The ssDNA templates com-
prising a 30 nt in randomized positions flanked by constant
region were prepared. The constant regions included a
sequence of 50-GGGAGAAGGG-30 right after a T7 promoter
for the efficient transcription (see results shown in Figure 3)
and targets for PCR primers and cloning sites. After ampli-
fication by PCR, the dsDNA templates were transcribed by T7
RNA polymerase in the presence of thioUTP, thioCTP, ATP
and GTP. The resulting 1014 thioRNA library was used for the
first round of the selection, and the selection processes were
repeated under various conditions (see Materials and Methods
for detail). As there was no further improvement in the binding

affinity between the 8th and 10th rounds, the thioRNA library
from the 10th round was reverse transcribed, amplified and
cloned. Three major classes, i.e. classes I, II and III, emerged
from analysis of the 24 clones (Figure 7). In each class, the
most abundant sequences represented 6 of the 24 sequences.
Affinities of individual full-length thioRNAs consisting of a
30 nt in randomized positions and the constant region were
tested by nitrocellurose filter-binding assay. The results showed
that CI-2 from class I and CII-1 from class II had the highest
binding affinity to humana-thrombin. In contrast, all thioRNAs
of class III showed the filter-binding affinity along with the
affinity to human a-thrombin (data not shown). Therefore,
the secondary structure predictions for CI-2 and CII-1 were
made using the Zuker RNA mfold computer algorithm (27).
For CI-2, a 23mer of the stem–bulge–loop structure CI-2-23 was
predicted, while the longer, similar stem-bulge-loop structure
CII-1-37 was predicted for CII-1 (Figure 8). The resulting CI-2-
23 consisted of a part of the randomized region, and 7 of the 23 nt
length came from thioUTP and thioCTP (gray letters). In con-
trast, the CII-1-37 contained the constant sequence (lower case)
on its stem region, and 16 of the 37 nt length came from thioUTP
and thioCTP (gray letters). The predicted thioRNAs were chem-
ically synthesized according to our previous method (23).
Because the predicted structures were different from the repor-
ted RNA aptamers to human a-thrombin, composed of stem–
loop structures, the binding assay of CI-2-23 and CII-1-37 with
the protein was examined along with RNA-24, which had

carrying the same sequence is indicated in parenthesis. The conserved sequences in each individual class are indicated by back ground colors. The sequences common
to all ligands are shown in lower case letters and the sequences of the variable region in upper case letters.

previously been selected as the high-affinity RNA aptamer. In
addition, the DNA aptamer DNA-G4 (35) to humana-thrombin
was also prepared for comparison.
The binding assay of each aptamer was carried out by the
filter-binding assay. The experiment performed with a con-
stant concentration of each aptamer (0.5 nM) and the concen-
tration of human a-thrombin was titrated from 0.1 to 111 or
333 nM. As shown in Figure 9, the aptamer possessing the
highest binding affinity was CII-1-37. When the molar ratio of
human a-thrombin and CII-1-37 was 222:1 (111 nM:0.5 nM),
60% maximal binding activity was observed, and the Kd
value of CII-1-37 was estimated as 4.7 nM. The binding activ-
ity of the other thioRNA aptamer CI-2-23 was lower. Since the
Kd value of RNA-24, prepared for comparison, was estimated
to be 85 nM in our hands, we succeeded in isolating a high-
affinity thioRNA aptamer to human a-thrombin using
thioUTP and thioCTP. Although further analyses of the
resulting thioRNA aptamers for their structures and functions
may be required, our results demonstrated that thioUTP (7)
and thioCTP (8) should be considered new NTP analogs inten-
ded for the development of nuclease-resistant functional RNA
molecules by SELEX.
