[1] Single-crystal Brillouin scattering to 25.2 GPa and powder X-ray diffraction to
65.2 GPa in a radial geometry were carried out on CaO (lime) at ambient temperature
in a diamond cell. From Brillouin scattering measurements the isentropic elastic
constants of CaO at ambient conditions are C11 = 219.4 (7), C12 = 58.1 (7), C44 =
80.0 (2) GPa, where the numbers in parentheses are 1s uncertainties on the last digit.
The pressure derivatives of the compressional and off-diagonal constants at ambient
pressure are @C11/@P = 9.9 (1), @C12/@P = 2.2 (1), respectively. The pressure
derivative of the shear constant is @C44/@P = 0.25 (3), and it becomes negative at
pressures above 5.9 GPa. Aggregate bulk and shear moduli are KS0 = 112.0 (2) and
G0 = 80.05 (9) GPa, and their pressure derivatives are 4.72 (6) and 1.69 (5),
respectively. The radial X-ray diffraction data allow us to estimate the yield strength
and the elastic constants of CaO using a phenomenological lattice strain model. The
calculated strength of CaO increases from 0.3 to 1.9 GPa in the pressure range
between 5.6 and 57.8 GPa. The estimated elastic constants are in good agreement with
the extrapolation of the Brillouin data up to 36.6 GPa. At higher pressures, C11
appears softer and C12 appears stiffer than the extrapolation of Brillouin results. The
value of C44 from radial diffraction is in agreement with the Brillouin data through the
entire experimental pressure range. The discrepancies between Brillouin and radial
diffraction data for C11 and C12 can be reconciled if a, the parameter which describes
degree of stress/strain continuity across the sample’s grains boundary, is allowed to
vary from 1 at 36.6 GPa to 0.82 at 65.2 GPa. The ‘‘hydrostatic’’ cell volumes
determined by applying lattice strain theory were fitted to the third-order Birch-
Murnaghan equation. The fitted bulk modulus and its pressure derivative are KT0 =
110 (5) GPa and (@KT/@P)T0 = 4.5 (4), consistent with the Brillouin results, although
possible softening of the equation of state at high pressure has been identified. The
general agreement between the results of the two methods indicates that radial
diffraction with lattice strain theory is a valid probe of the mechanical properties of a
moderately soft cubic solid as CaO at ultrahigh pressures. However, more tests are
required to quantify the effect of plasticity and texturing on the results of this method.

1. Introduction
[2] Elastic properties of minerals at high pressure (and
temperature) are required to develop reliable geophysical
models of the Earth’s deep interior, which integrate
cosmochemical and geochemical information with global
seismological models [Duffy and Anderson, 1989]. The
elastic moduli of minerals control the velocity of propa-
gation of seismic waves and knowledge of their pressure,
temperature and compositional dependence is necessary to
interpret velocity anomalies of seismic tomography mod-
els in terms of variations of temperature, composition and
mineralogy [Karato and Karki, 2001]. Knowing the
complete elastic tensor [Cij], instead of just the aggregate
bulk and shear moduli, allows us to determine the elastic
anisotropy of minerals and helps in interpreting the
azimuthal seismic anisotropy in the Earth’s interior.
[3] The transition of minerals from elastic behavior to
plastic deformation, characterized by their mechanical
strength, has a fundamental role in determining the onset
of flow in the solid state. Plastic deformation of minerals

is also related to texturing and preferred orientation and
produces seismic attenuation phenomena, which generate
distinct seismic signatures [Karato and Wu, 1993].
[4] The techniques that allow direct measurement of the
elastic moduli such as ultrasonic interferometry, resonant
ultrasound spectroscopy and Brillouin scattering are pres-
ently limited at most to pressures of the uppermost part of
the lower mantle [Zha et al., 2000] (also see Liebermann
and Li [1998] for a review). This limitation has stimulated
the development of alternative methods to extract indirect
information about the elastic properties at very high
pressures.
[5] Radial X-ray diffraction of powder samples com-
pressed in a diamond anvil cell combined with the theory
of lattice strain under nonhydrostatic stress [Singh et al.,
1998a] allows us to estimate the strength of materials at
high pressure. In addition, nonhydrostatic stress condi-
tions produce preferred orientation of aggregates easily
detectable by radial X-ray diffraction making this tech-
nique suitable for the study of mineral deformation at
ultrahigh pressures [Merkel et al., 2002; Wenk et al.,
2004].
[6] Understanding the actual stress conditions that are
achieved during nonhydrostatic compression of powdered
samples in opposed anvil cells and the use of those
nonhydrostatic conditions to constrain mechanical proper-
ties of materials is a long-standing subject of research,
approached both on the theoretical and experimental
ground [Singh and Kennedy, 1974; Ruoff, 1975; Meade
and Jeanloz, 1988; Funamori et al., 1994; Matthies et al.,
2001]. Recently, the difference between the results of
X-ray radial diffraction of e-Fe [Singh et al., 1998b] and
high-pressure measurements of sound velocity and elastic
constants by inelastic X-ray scattering, Raman scattering,
and theoretical computations [Mao et al., 1998; Steinle-
Neumann et al., 1999; Merkel et al., 2000; Antonangeli et
al., 2004] has raised questions about the reliability of
radial X-ray diffraction as a means to constrain the elastic
tensor of minerals at pressures. In addition, the incorpora-
tion of texturing and of plastic deformation poses serious
limitations to the application of the lattice strain theory,
which is based on the assumption that the examined
material behaves purely elastically [Matthies et al., 2001;
Weidner et al., 2004]. In order to further test the reliability
of radial X-ray diffraction we have performed a study of
CaO in which we compare direct measurements of single-
crystal elastic properties by Brillouin scattering with radial
X-ray diffraction on the same material subject to non-
hydrostatic compression.
[7] CaO is a prototype of binary ionic oxides and the
knowledge of its elasticity can improve our basic under-
standing of metal oxides bonding interactions, which can
be used to interpret more complex oxide compounds.
CaO is also a chemical component of relevance to the
Earth’s mantle, and the decomposition of CaSiO3 could
allow the presence of CaO as a separate mineral phase in
the lower mantle. Finally, CaO undergoes a structural
phase transition from NaCl-type structure to CsCl-type at
P = 53–70 GPa at room temperature [Jeanloz et al.,
1979; Richet et al., 1988; Yamanaka et al., 2002]. It has
been proposed that the transition is driven by elastic shear
instability, caused by vanishing of C44 [Karki and Crain,
1998]. Probing the elastic behavior of CaO with increas-
ing pressure can allow us to better understand phenomena
preceding the elastic destabilization.
2. Samples and Methods
2.1. Brillouin Scattering
[8] A single crystal of CaO obtained from Commercial
Crystal Laboratories (Naples, Florida) was cut in a general
direction, which was later determined to be (0 0.4 1) and
double-side polished to a thickness of 25 mm. CaO is highly
hygroscopic, for this reason the single crystal sample was
stored in mineral oil and polished and loaded in water-free
fluids. The measured lattice constant determined by powder
X-ray diffraction is 4.8115 (5) A˚, in excellent agreement
with the value of 4.8105 A˚ reported by Wyckoff [1963].
[9] Two sets of measurements were performed on two
different fragments of the double-side polished plate. In the
first experiment Brillouin scattering was measured at 0.75,
2.0, 4.8, 5.9, 7.3, 8.4, 9.7 and 11.1 GPa and then at 17.3 and
23 GPa; in the second experiment measurements were
performed at 0.9, 3.2, 5.3, 7.6 and 9.8 GPa and then at
17.9, 18.8 and 25.2 GPa.
[10] In both the experiments, the crystal platelets were
loaded in modified Merrill-Bassett diamond anvil cells
[Merrill and Bassett, 1974] with a 96 aperture angle.
Each sample was placed in a cylindrical chamber
obtained by drilling a 250-mm diameter hole in a stainless
steel gasket preindented to a thickness of 55 mm. The
samples were compressed between 500-mm diamond
culets. A mixture of methanol and ethanol with volume
ratio 4:1 was used as a pressure medium, and a few ruby
chips were loaded in the cells as a pressure calibrant
[Mao et al., 1986].
[11] We measured pressure both before and after the
Brillouin measurements at each loading step. We also
waited for 4 hours for stabilization after each pressure
increment. In all sets of high-pressure experiments, the R1
ruby fluorescence line showed broadening with pressure,
but until 11.1 GPa the width variation was smaller than 15%
of the width at room pressure. The data points collected at
higher pressure showed a someway larger broadening of the
R1 peak. The difference between the pressures measured at
different positions in the sample chamber never exceeded
0.2 GPa at pressures below 17.3 GPa. The differences
increased to 0.4 GPa at the pressures from 17.3 to 25.2 GPa.
[12] Brillouin scattering measurements were carried out
using the 532.15 nm line of a Nd:YVO4 laser. The signal
was collected by a Sandercock-type Fabry-Perot multipass
tandem interferometer, and measured by a solid-state photon
detector with 70% quantum efficiency in the spectral region
of interest.
[13] Measurements were performed at room pressure on a
thick (2 mm) platelet with the same orientation as the
samples loaded in the diamond cell. Both room pressure
and high-pressure Brillouin measurements were performed
in symmetric forward scattering geometry. The angle be-
tween the incident and scattered beam was 110 degree. The
exposure time for each spectrum was on average 15 min.
Precision and accuracy of the acoustic velocity determina-
tions were tested on standard oxides and are better then
0.5% (at 1s level). Acoustic velocity was measured in 20 to

36 directions at each pressure. Two acoustic modes, one
quasi-longitudinal and one quasi-shear were detected.
[14] Particular care was devoted to prevent vignetting
effects from the body of the diamond cell [Oliver et al.,
1992; Sinogeikin and Bass, 2000]. Adjustable slits were
placed both along the incident and the scattered light paths
and their opening sizes were calibrated performing test
measurements on standard materials. A detailed description
of the experimental setup is given by Speziale and Duffy
[2002].
2.2. Radial X-Ray Diffraction Measurements
[15] CaO powder (Alfa Aesar) was ground and homog-
enized for more than 1 hour to an average 5 mm grain size
and loaded in a 70-mm sample chamber drilled in a Be
gasket preindented to a pressure of 23 GPa. The powders
were gently precompacted and loaded in compact piston-
cylinder high-pressure cells. The samples were compressed
between 300-mm diamond culets. A single fragment of Mo
foil, 5 to 10 mm in diameter, was loaded with each sample.
The Mo fragment was placed exactly at the center of the
diamond culets as a positioning reference point and as a
pressure marker. We selected Mo to prevent overlaps with
the diffraction lines of the sample.
[16] Room pressure X-ray diffraction of the CaO powder
samples yielded a0 = 4.8108 (3) A˚, in very good agreement
with the value determined for the single crystal sample.
Because of the high sensitivity of CaO to water, the powder
sample was stored in a dry atmosphere and used in the first
few hours after the bottle was opened. We tested by X-ray
diffraction that in the first 5 hours after the sample was
opened no trace of Ca(OH)2 was detectable.
[17] Radial X-ray diffraction experiments were performed
in energy dispersive geometry at the X17C beam line of the
National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven
National Laboratory (Upton, New York). Incident X rays
were collimated with slits to 50 mm  60 mm and then
focused to the sample with Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors to a
final 8 mm  15 mm size. The size of the beam was
measured by a sharp opaque edge. The diffracted X rays
were collected with a brass collimator with 40 mm aperture,
which also operated as a spatial filter. The beam finally
passed through a slit system positioned in front of a Ge
solid-state detector.
[18] In this set of experiments the incident beam passed
‘‘radially’’ through the Be gasket. The X-ray diffraction was
performed using a double circle horizontal diffractometer.
The scattering angle 2q was fixed to 10.000 (1) degrees. The
diamond cell was mounted on a vertical goniometer whose
rotation axis corresponded to the bisector of the scattering
angle. A schematic diagram of the radial X-ray diffraction
experimental setup and scattering geometry is given in
Figure 1. The X ray was directed to the region of the
sample in contact with the Mo marker, in order to collect
spectra from the axial region of the sample chamber and to
have direct information of the actual experimental pressure
using the equation of state of Mo by Zhao et al. [2001].
[19] After each pressurization step, spectra were collected
at intervals of 15 min until the peaks’ positions converged to
stable values, indicating a complete stress relaxation of the
sample. The relaxation was complete, on average, in 2 h. At
the end of the data set collection at a given loading (which
lasted on average 6 h) another measurement was performed
in the same geometry as that at the beginning. No further
relaxation was observed at any pressure.
[20] At each compression step, spectra were collected at 7
values of the angle y between the diamonds axis and the
diffracting plane normal (y = 0, 24, 35, 45, 55, 66,
90). A more detailed description of the experimental
technique is given by Duffy et al. [1999a, 1999b].
3. Data Analysis
3.1. Brillouin Scattering
[21] The acoustic velocity was determined from the
measured Brillouin frequency shift in forward symmetric
geometry [Withfield et al., 1976]:

where l0 is the incident laser wavelength, and a is the
external incidence angle. An example spectrum collected at
8.4 GPa is given in Figure 2. CaO crystallizes in the cubic
system and it has three nonzero, independent elastic
constants: C11, C12, and C44. The elastic constants and the
crystal platelet orientation were determined by inversion of
the set of velocities measured at each pressure using
Christoffel’s equation [Auld, 1973]
Ciklmlk lm  rv2dil
 
ul ¼ 0; ð2Þ
where Ciklm are the elastic constants (in full notation), lk and
lm are the direction cosines of the phonon, and ul is the local
displacement vector, r is the density of the material, dil is the
Kronecker delta. Three velocity data sets collected at 1 bar,
8.4 GPa, and 23 GPa pressure are plotted in Figure 3
together with the calculated velocity model from the
inversion results. The uncertainty on the measured trans-
verse velocities is on average 1% of the measurement, while
the uncertainty on the longitudinal velocities is 2%. The
main reason of this difference is the low intensity of the
Brillouin peaks for the longitudinal acoustic mode, caused
by modest elasto-optic coupling (Pockel’s tensor) in several
directions along the investigated crystal plane of CaO.
[22] Voigt and Reuss bounds to the aggregate bulk
modulus, KS, and shear modulus, G, were calculated from
the inverted elastic constants at each pressure. The pressure
dependence of both the isentropic constants and aggregate
moduli was determined by inversion to Eulerian finite strain
equations [Davies and Dziewonski, 1975]. The room pres-
sure isentropic moduli and constants and their pressure
derivatives were converted to isothermal values by means
of thermodynamic identities [Barsch, 1967] using parame-
ters reported in Table 1.
3.2. Radial X-Ray Diffraction
[23] The radial X-ray diffraction data collected at each
pressure (Figure 4) were analyzed following the model
developed by Singh [1993] and Singh et al. [1998a] and
here briefly summarized.
[24] The diamond anvil cell is a uniaxial stress device. We
define s33 as the maximum stress along the direction of the
diamond anvils axes and s11 the minimum stress along the
plane orthogonal to the diamonds’ axes. The stress state, sij,
at the center of the sample chamber is given by
sij ¼ sP þ Dij; ð3Þ
where sP = (2s11 + s33)/3 is the hydrostatic stress
component and Dij is the deviatoric stress component. We
define the quantity t = (s33  s11) as the differential stress,
whose upper limit is the yield strength (sy), equal to twice
the shear strength (ty) of the sample material at the pressure
sP.

where dm(hkl) is the measured d spacing, y is the angle

constants. Abbreviations are as in Figure 2.

where Sij are the elastic compliances of the sample material
at the pressure sP, and G(hkl) = (h
2k2 + k2l2 + l2h2)/(h2 +
k2 + l2) 2 is an orientation-dependent factor.
[26] We fixed the parameter a to the value of 1
corresponding to stress continuity across the grain bound-
aries in the sample [Funamori et al., 1994]. Weighed linear
fitting of the observed d spacings of the three lattice planes
families (111), (200), and (220) of CaO to equation (4)
allowed us to determine the ‘‘hydrostatic’’ strains dP(hkl)
and the parameter Q(hkl) for the three different examined
lattice planes (Figure 5). The diffraction peaks of the two
lattice plane families (110) and (200) of the Mo marker were
also inverted using equation (4) and the ‘‘hydrostatic’’
pressure, sP, in the sample chamber was determined using
molybdenum equation of state of Zhao et al. [2001].
[27] Fitting of Q(hkl) and the factor G(hkl) using a linear
relation (Figure 6) allowed us to directly determine the
Zener anisotropy factor A = 2(S11 – S12)/S44 = 2C44/(C11 –
C12). From the elastic anisotropy, we could estimate the
uniaxial stress component t = s33 – s11, using the relation
[Singh et al., 1998b]
t ¼ 6GhQ hklð ÞiF A;að Þ; ð7Þ
where G is the aggregate shear modulus appropriate for the
boundary conditions defined by the parameter a, hQ(hkl)i is
the average of the Q(hkl) values of the lattice plane families,
and F(A, a) is a function of the anisotropy factor and of the
parameter a [see Singh et al., 1998a, 1998b]. Combining
the parameters t, Q(hkl), A, and G(hkl), directly obtained
from the X-ray radial diffraction data with the high-pressure
bulk modulus and the shear modulus extrapolated from
single-crystal Brillouin scattering, we could calculate the
full elastic compliance tensor at each experimental pressure
[e.g., Singh et al., 1998b].

tively inverted using Christoffel’s equation. The inversion
converged to a self-consistent density model and elastic
constants (Table 2). Only the data collected up to 11.1 GPa
were used to obtain the density model, because the alcohol
mixture used as a pressure medium is known to become
solid in the 11–12 GPa pressure range. The resulting elastic
constants are shown in Figure 7.
[29] The Brillouin data obtained at pressures ranging
from 17.3 to 25.2 GPa proved to be in excellent agreement
with the extrapolation of the results from pressure below
11.1 GPa (Figure 7). The inversion also yielded the orien-
tation of the sample platelet, which is (0 0.4 1). The overall
precision (at 1s level) of the moduli determination is 1% for
C11 and C44 and 3% for C12. The precision of the orientation
determination is better than 2 on the Eulerian angle that
relate the crystallographic reference system to the laboratory
reference system [Shimizu, 1995]. No systematic variation
of the recovered orientation was observed with pressure.
The value of the moduli at room pressure and their pressure
derivatives are reported in Table 3. The Hill average of the
Voigt and Reuss bounds to the aggregate moduli are
reported in Table 4.
[30] The longitudinal constant C11 and the off-diagonal
constant C12 show a substantially linear increase through
the whole experimental pressure range. C12 presents a slight
curvature, which is detectable at the highest pressures
(above 17.3 GPa) and is accurately described by the fit to
a third-order Eulerian strain equation. The shear constant
C44 reaches a maximum value of 81.1 GPa at 5.9 GPa. After
5.9 GPa its pressure derivative becomes negative. At a
pressure of 25.2 GPa, C44 decreases to 76.5 GPa, and its
pressure derivative reaches a value of 0.4.
[31] The elastic constants determined at standard condi-
tions are in good agreement with the available data from
ultrasonics techniques [Son and Bartles, 1972; Chang and
Graham, 1977; Oda et al., 1992], and they are within 10%
of the athermal constants calculated by Karki and Crain
[1998] using density functional theory (Table 3). The
pressure derivatives of all the constants are lower than those
determined by Son and Bartles [1972] based on measure-

ments performed only up to 0.2 GPa. Our results for the
pressure derivatives of C12 and C44 are comparable, within
their respective uncertainties, with those of Chang and
Graham [1977], who compressed CaO up to 1 GPa.
However, the pressure derivative of C11 determined by
Chang and Graham is more than 4% larger than the value
determined in this study. If we consider that the pressure
range explored in this study is more than 1 order of
magnitude larger than that explored in previous studies,
this discrepancy confirms analogous differences between
the pressure derivatives of elastic moduli previously
reported from the comparison of moderate- versus high-
pressure studies, in other systems, both using X-ray diffrac-
tion and spectroscopic methods [e.g., Zha et al., 1998].
[32] The Hill averages of the aggregate moduli deter-
mined in this study are in agreement with the results of
previous elasticity measurements [Son and Bartels, 1972;
Chang and Graham, 1977; Oda et al., 1992] and with the
results of the static compression study of Richet et al.
[1988]. The pressure derivative of the shear modulus is in
agreement with those of low-pressure ultrasonic studies, and
that of the bulk modulus is in excellent agreement with the
results of Chang and Graham [1977] but in large disagree-
ment with those of Soga [1968] and Son and Bartels [1972].
The value of (@KT/@P)T0 that we obtain from Brillouin
spectroscopy is more than 12% higher than the values
determined from static compression by Mammone et al.
[1981] and Richet et al. [1988]. However, this discrepancy
does not preclude an overall consistency of the Brillouin
isotherm with the experimental results of the X-ray diffrac-
tion studies due to the strong correlation between the bulk
modulus and its pressure derivative in fitting volume-
pressure data to an equation of state [e.g., Angel, 2000].
[33] The strong variation of the elastic anisotropy with
pressure is one of the most interesting characteristics of CaO
elastic behavior. The Zener anisotropy factor A, which is the
square of the ratio of the acoustic velocity of the transverse
mode propagating along [100] and that of the transverse
mode propagating along [110] with [110] polarization,
varies from 0.98 at 1 bar, which corresponds to an almost
isotropic solid, to 0.42 at 25.2 GPa (Figure 3). Ab initio
calculations show a systematic pressure induced decrease of
the ratio between the longitudinal acoustic velocities along
[110] and [100] in all the alkaline-earth oxides [Tsuchiya
and Kawamura, 2001]. This effect can be explained using a
spherical ionic model of these B1 structure oxides, because
the higher compressibility of the oxygen ion causes a
continuous increase of the cation/anion ratio and of the
packing density along the [100] direction, with a consequent
decrease of the ratio of the longitudinal velocities along
[110] and [100]. The variation of anisotropy with pressure is
dramatic in the case of MgO, which presents a reversal of

the anisotropy experimentally observed at about 20 GPa
[Duffy et al., 1995] and subsequently confirmed by
theory [Karki et al., 1997a] and by Brillouin experiments
[Sinogeikin and Bass, 2000]. The effect is also observed in
the oxides of heavier alkaline earth metals (Sr, Ba, and Ca)
but the elastic anisotropy reversal occurs at high tempera-
ture (Figure 8). The elastic anisotropy factor A of CaO
increases at high temperature and ambient pressure; it
reaches the value of 1.23 at 1200 K [Oda et al., 1992],
consistent with the increase of A with increasing volume
observed across all the alkaline earth oxides series.
[34] For MgO, the main process that generates the vari-
ation of the anisotropy ratio, A, is the stiffening of C11. In
the case of CaO, the stiffening of C11 is combined with
softening of the shear constant C44 at pressures above
5.9 GPa. C44 softening in CaO precedes a structural phase
transition to a high-pressure polymorph with CsCl-type
structure, already well documented [e.g., Jeanloz et al.,
1979; Mammone et al., 1981], that we also observed by
X-ray diffraction at 57.8 GPa. The pressure at which we
observed the transition is consistent both with previous
static and dynamic compression experiments [Jeanloz and
Ahrens, 1980;Richet et al., 1988; Yamanaka et al., 2002], and
with first principles calculations [Karki and Wentzkovitch,
2003]. Softening of C44 is observed for both SrO and BaO
[Chang and Graham, 1977] and confirmed by ab initio
simulations [Tsuchiya and Kawamura, 2001] at lower
pressure than for CaO, while for MgO it is not experimen-
tally observed up to 55 GPa [Zha et al., 2000] nor predicted
theoretically at pressure below 300 GPa [Karki et al.,
1997b].
[35] At pressures between 8 and 11 GPa, the pressure
derivative of C44 is already slightly negative. The Brillouin
scattering data collected at pressure between 17.3 and 25.2
GPa confirm a slow decrease of C44 with pressure, in
excellent agreement with the extrapolation of the fit to a
third-order Eulerian equation [Davies, 1974]:
Cijkl ¼ 1þ 2fð Þ7=2 C0ijkl þ a1f
h i
 PDijkl; ð8Þ
where f = 0.5[(V0/V)
2/3  1] is the Eulerian finite strain, Cijkl0
is the value of the elastic constant at ambient conditions,
Dijkl = dijdkl  dikdjl  dildjk and P is the pressure. The
coefficient a1 is equal to [3KT0(@Cijkl
0 /@P + Dijkl)  7Cijkl0 ],
where KT0 and @Cijkl
0 /@P are the isothermal bulk modulus
and the pressure derivative of the elastic constant Cijkl at
ambient conditions.
[36] The vanishing of C44 at high pressure defines the
mechanical instability of the NaCl structure for CaO,
violating one of Born’s stability criteria for solids with
cubic symmetry [Born and Huang, 1954]. The extrapolated
pressure at which C44 vanishes is 122 GPa, in disagreement
with 177 GPa calculated at 0 K by Karki et al. [1997b] even
taking into account the temperature effect. The reason of
the apparent disagreement is caused by the systematic
overestimation of volume by Karki et al. [1997b] [see
also Karki and Crain, 1998]. The stability criterion, C44 =
0, is an upper bound to the transition pressure itself. The
CsCl structure-type phase is predicted to become thermo-
dynamically stable at pressure above 50 GPa [Karki and
Wentzkovitch, 2003].
[37] The pressure dependence of C44 as determined from
our Brillouin scattering data below P = 11.1 GPa can be
adequately fitted with a third-order Eulerian strain equation.
It can also be fitted to a fourth-order Eulerian strain equation
of the form [Davies, 1974]

second pressure derivative of the elastic constant and the
first pressure derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus at
ambient conditions, respectively. Equation (9) represents
the next order expansion of (8) in Eulerian strain.
[38] The quality of the fit to the third-order and to the
fourth-order equations is not significantly distinguishable.
The parameters of the fourth-order fitting are C44 = 79.5 (2)

‘‘fourth-order’’ extrapolatedC44 vanishes at 59GPa. Because
of the strong curvature of the fourth-order equation the
extrapolated values of C44 differ as much as 14% from
the data that we collected at 25.2 GPa. We decided to reject
the fourth-order fit because the limited experimental pressure
range does not guarantee sufficient constraint on the second-
order pressure derivative of C44.

4.2. Radial Diffraction
[39] The radial X-ray diffraction data were analyzed
following the model outlined by Singh et al. [1998a]
assuming stress continuity across grain boundaries (a = 1,
see section 3.2). The results of the inversion are reported in
Table 5. The hydrostatic pressures and the cell parameter for
CaO at each pressure (see section 3.2 for details on the data
analysis), were fitted to a third-order Birch-Murnaghan
equation of state fixing the unit cell parameter at ambient
conditions to our experimental value. The inversion yielded
a bulk modulus KT0 = 110 (5) GPa and its pressure
derivative (@KT/@P)T0 = 4.5 (4). Fixing KT0 = 110.7 GPa
from the Brillouin results gives (@KT/@P)T0 equal to 4.4 (5),
in agreement with our Brillouin results. The agreement
between the 300 K isotherm from radial X-ray diffraction
and from Brillouin scattering is excellent along the whole
common pressure range, and it extends, within reciprocal
uncertainties up to 36.6 GPa.
[40] The extrapolation above 36.6 GPa produces incon-
sistency between the Brillouin isotherm and the X-ray
diffraction data (Figure 9). The discrepancy can be recon-
ciled introducing a higher-order term in the Eulerian strain
equation for the bulk modulus. The new fit parameter,
(@2KT/@P
2)T0 = 0.08 (6) GPa1, does not visibly improve
the quality of the fitting of the Brillouin data obtained
with the third-order Eulerian equation (which, because of
truncation, constrains (@2KT/@P
2)T0 to an effective value of
0.05 GPa1). The fourth-order isotherm is in excellent
agreement with the X-ray diffraction data (Figure 9) at high
pressure suggesting that a possible softening of the pressure
derivative of the bulk modulus is present at pressures
ranging between 40 and 60 GPa. The apparent softening
might be related to the phase transition to a CsCl structured
polymorph that we observed at 57.8 GPa.
[41] Even though our X-ray diffraction data are in rea-
sonable agreement with previous results [Mammone et al.,
1981; Richet et al., 1988; Yamanaka et al., 2002], it is
interesting to notice the large disagreement between the
equation of state parameters determined in the different
studies (Table 4). The discrepancies in the fitted parameters
are not entirely justified by the experimental results
(Figure 9) but are caused by the strong correlation between
the bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives discussed
earlier. Placing constraints on the value of the bulk modulus
by direct elasticity measurements solves this problem.
[42] By fitting the values of Q(hkl) and G(hkl) for all the
diffraction lines with a linear relation we could determine
Zener anisotropy factor, A (Table 5). The retrieved elastic
anisotropy increases in magnitude (i.e., Zener anisotropy
factor decreases below 1) with pressure, in good agreement
with the experimental Brillouin data and their extrapolation
(Figure 10). The differential stress, t, determined using

equation (7) increases from 0.3 to 1.9 GPa, in the range
between 5.6 and 57.8 GPa (Table 5). A decreased value, 1.1
GPa, calculated at the maximum experimental pressure,
might be related to the presence of coexisting NaCl-type
and CsCl-type polymorphs, as detected by X-ray diffraction.
[43] The ratio of differential stress to shear modulus, t/G,
is plotted in Figure 11 in comparison with other compounds
with NaCl-type structure. It is evident from Figure 11, that
MgO and FeO present a relatively larger strength than
CaO and NaCl, which are characterized by more ionic
bonding. Vanishing of the pressure dependence of t/G
above 17.9 GPa could also be interpreted as an indication
of large plastic flow or a change in the deformation
mechanism.
[44] The Zener anisotropy factor from radial diffraction,
together with the extrapolated shear modulus and bulk
modulus, were used to also estimate the elastic constants
at high pressure using the procedure outlined by Singh et al.
[1998a]. Because of the observed consistency between the
aggregate bulk modulus determined by Brillouin and X-ray
diffraction, we constrained it to the values from Brillouin
at the relevant pressures, after conversion to isothermal
conditions. The estimated elastic constants are reported in
Table 5.
[45] At P < 36.6 GPa the calculated X-ray elastic con-
stants are in good agreement with those determined by
Brillouin spectroscopy and their extrapolation (Figure 7). At
pressure higher than 36.6 GPa we observed an increasing
discrepancy of the value of C11 and C12 with respect to the
extrapolation from Brillouin data. C11 is 12% softer and C12
is 40% stiffer than the extrapolation of Brillouin data at the
maximum pressure of 65.2 GPa.
[46] In the lattice strain equations a strong correlation
exists between the value of t, and the parameter a, which
defines the boundary conditions in the analysis of the elastic
response of the sample. In order to evaluate the value of the
parameter a, we fixed the elastic constants using our
Brillouin results and determining a from equation (5).
The results are shown in Table 5. The value of a is
constrained to 1.0 (2) at pressure between 14.3 GPa and
36.6 GPa. Then it decreases and it reaches a constant value
of 0.82 (8) at pressures above 49.7 GPa (Figure 12). The
interpretation of the data at pressure below 14.3 GPa is
unclear. It is possible that the sample is still undergoing
changes in the geometric relationship between grains due to
incomplete compaction.
[47] Recent independent results for MgO at pressures in
the range between 2 and 6 GPa at 500C [Weidner et al.,
2004] and in the pressure range between 0 and 8 GPa at
ambient temperature [Uchida et al., 2004] have demonstrated
that the onset of plastic deformation substantially changes
the behavior of powder materials in uniaxial compression
devices potentially causing large violations of the assump-
tions of lattice strain theory. The discrepancy between the
extrapolated elastic constants from Brillouin measurements
and the calculated elastic constants from radial X-ray
diffraction data could also be affected by plastic deforma-
tion of the sample, which results in large heterogeneity of
the uniaxial stress supported by subpopulations of crystal-
lites with different orientation, as also suggested by Singh
[2000]. The existence of this effect would cause large
deviations from the linear dependence of the measured d
spacings with respect to the orientation parameter, 1–
3cos2y (see section 3.2), that we did not observe within
our experimental resolution.
[48] Fixing the value of the elastic constants to the results
of Brillouin measurement, we can also invert the radial
diffraction data to estimate the microscopic yield stress,
t(hkl), defined as [Singh et al., 1998a]
Q hklð Þ ¼ t hklð Þ=3 S11  S12  3G hklð Þ S11  S12  S44=2ð Þ½ 
ð10Þ
along slip directions in the relevant slip planes. Following
Singh [2000], in the plastic deformation regime, the value of
t(hkl) is directly related to the orientation average of the
critical resolved shear stress for the selected slip system. In
the case of competing slip systems, the one with the lowest
critical stress, i.e., the lowest t(hkl), is operative and
progressive texturing could cause systematic differences

between t(hkl) for the different lattice planes. The values of
t(200), t(220), t(111), which are all potential slip planes in
the B1 structure, were calculated using the elastic constants
determined by Brillouin scattering and the Q(hkl) deter-
mined from radial X-ray diffraction. However, the present
results (Table 5) show that t(200), t(220), and t(111)
fluctuate at each pressure about their overall average value,
without any systematic pressure effect and so no clear
evidence for plastic anisotropy can be identified.
5. Conclusions
[49] The combination of Brillouin scattering measure-
ments and radial X-ray diffraction allowed us to better
constrain the elasticity of CaO at high pressure. Over the
common pressure range, the results of the two sets of
measurements are in agreement within a few percent. The
parameters of the 300 K isotherm from Brillouin scattering,
are, KT0 = 110.7 (3), (@KT/@P)T0 = 4.8 (1). The results of
X-ray diffraction to 65.2 GPa suggest a softening of the
equation of state probably related to the approaching transi-
tion to a high-pressure polymorph. Brillouin scattering in the
pressure range between 17.3 and 25.2 GPa shows softening
of C44. The extrapolated pressure at which the crystal
structure is mechanically unstable is 122 GPa. Radial X-
ray diffraction allow us to determine the high-pressure
strength of CaO, which increases from 0.3 to 1.9 GPa in
the pressure range between 5.6 and 57.8 GPa, and to
determine the elastic anisotropy and the elastic constants.
Over the common experimental range and upon extrapola-
tion to 36.6 GPa, the two methods are in excellent agreement.
At pressure above 36.6 GPa, C11 becomes as much as 12%
softer and C12 as much as 40% stiffer than the extrapolation
of Brillouin data. The discrepancy between Brillouin extrap-
olations and radial diffraction results can be reconciled by a
decrease of a, the parameter describing stress/strain conti-
nuity across grain boundaries in the sample, from 1 at
36.6 GPa to 0.82 at 65.2 GPa. However, the possible effects
of plastic deformation cannot be ruled out at present.
