ABSTRACT
MetaCyc is a database of metabolic pathways and
enzymes located at http://MetaCyc.org/. Its goal
is to serve as a metabolic encyclopedia, containing
a collection of non-redundant pathways central to
15small molecule metabolism, which have been
reported in the experimental literature. Most of the
pathways in MetaCyc occur in microorganisms and
plants, although animal pathways are also repre-
sented. MetaCyc contains metabolic pathways,
20enzymatic reactions, enzymes, chemical compounds,
genes and review-level comments. Enzyme infor-
mation includes substrate specificity, kinetic pro-
perties, activators, inhibitors, cofactor requirements
and links to sequence and structure databases.
25Data are curated from the primary literature by curat-
ors with expertise in biochemistry and molecular
biology. MetaCyc serves as a readily accessible
comprehensive resource on microbial and plant
pathways for genome analysis, basic research, edu-
30cation, metabolic engineering and systems biology.
Querying, visualization and curation of the database
is supported by SRI’s Pathway Tools software. The
PathoLogic component of Pathway Tools is used
in conjunction with MetaCyc to predict the meta-
35bolic network of an organism from its annotated
genome. SRI and the European Bioinformatics
Institute employed this tool to create pathway/
genome databases (PGDBs) for 165 organisms,
available at the BioCyc.org website. These PGDBs
40also include predicted operons and pathway hole
fillers.
INTRODUCTION
MetaCyc is a reference database of small molecule metabol-
ism that contains experimentally verified pathway and enzyme
45information curated from the scientific literature (1). A meta-
bolic pathway in MetaCyc consists of reactions, enzymes,
metabolites, information on feedback regulation and genes
that encode the enzymes for each species (Figure 1). The
current version of MetaCyc (9.5) contains 621 pathways
50from >500 species (Tables 1 and 2) ranging from microbes
to plants and humans, with >90% of the information curated
from >7300 research articles. MetaCyc can be searched and
browsed using a web browser. Pathways are dynamically
generated from the database and graphically displayed with
55hyperlinks to various pages detailing reactions, enzymes,
genes and compounds from MetaCyc, as well as external
databases such as Swiss-Prot and PubMed. It, therefore, serves
as a readily accessible source of up-to-date, literature-curated
information on metabolic pathways and enzymes to research-
60ers for use in basic research and genome analysis, and to
students and teachers for educational purposes. In addition,
MetaCyc, in conjunction with the Pathway Tools software (2),
can be used to predict metabolic networks from a list of annot-
ated sequences resulting from genome or transcript sequencing
65(3–5). Those predicted networks can provide a knowledge
framework onto which reaction flux models can be built.
A number of major improvements made in the last 2 years
are described in this article. There has been a significant
increase in the content of the database, covering both primary
70metabolism and less common pathways, such as microbial
degradation of environmental pollutants and plant secondary
metabolism. Other improvements include reorganization
and expansion of both the pathway and cellular component
ontologies, and enhancement of the Web pages providing
75background information about MetaCyc, such as the user’s
guide at URL http://metacyc.org/MetaCycUserGuide.shtml.

DATA CONTENT
5As demonstrated in Table 3, there has been a significant
increase in the number of database objects since the last
Nucleic Acids Research publication 2 years ago (1). The num-
ber of metabolic pathways has increased by 26% from 491 to
621, while the number of enzymes, genes and citations has
10 grown considerably more, by 75, 71 and 140%, respectively,
owing to the fact that many existing pathways have been
extensively edited and updated with comments, enzymes,
genes and citations. There has also been a 128% increase in
the number of organisms represented (currently at 506),
15 reflecting the breadth of MetaCyc (Tables 1 and 2), and a
57% increase in the number of chemical compounds (currently
4620).
Data in MetaCyc are curated from the experimental liter-
ature, which is read and summarized by PhD-level curators.
20Curators at SRI cover microbial and animal pathways, while
curators at Carnegie Institution cover pathways from higher
plants. MetaCyc contains the full complement of EcoCyc
metabolic pathways (6) and thus has most of the basic path-
ways of central and intermediary metabolism typical of enteric
25bacteria. Similarly, most of the pathways of central metabol-
ism in higher plants are present in the database. Our current
curation strategy focuses on both depth and breadth, by updat-
ing pathways that lack complete information, and adding new
pathways outside of central metabolism.
30The MetaCyc Curator’s Guide for Pathway/Genome Data-
bases, located at URL http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/
curatorsguide.pdf, was developed to ensure the consistency of
curation procedures. It documents the type of information that
should be captured for each pathway, reaction, enzyme, gene
35and chemical compound. It also describes stylistic conven-
tions. We recently revised it to explicitly define the organiza-
tion of metabolic pathways in MetaCyc, and to provide
Figure 1. A representative example of a pathway in MetaCyc. Pathways can be displayed at varying levels of detail. This pathway display depicts an intermediate
level of detail including enzymes, EC numbers, genes and chemical structures of the main compounds. Notice the brown arrows that provide hyperlinks to related
upstream and downstream pathways.
D512 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Database issue
detailed guidelines for defining pathway boundaries (the com-
pounds with which a pathway should begin and end) and for
defining links between pathways.
To ensure the accuracy and coverage of new and existing
5pathways, we are currently in the process of inviting outside
experts to support the database as editors and/or curators in
their fields of expertise.
Pathways, enzymes, reactions and compounds
Most of the pathways in MetaCyc occur in the microorganism
10 and plant kingdoms, a manifestation of their metabolic divers-
ity. Nevertheless, animal pathways are also represented. Since
November 2003 we added >140 new pathways in the areas of
small molecule intermediary metabolism, and the biosynthesis
and degradation of natural environmental compounds, envir-
15onmental pollutants, xenobiotics and compounds involved in
general cellular processes and secondary metabolism. Of these
63 are plant pathways, many of which concern the produc-
tion of compounds involved in cellular regulation processes
(phytohormones) and defense mechanisms (phytoalexins and
20phytoanticipins), and plant secondary (or specialized) meta-
bolites. To accommodate these new types of pathways, we
expanded the pathway ontology to include categories for
plant secondary metabolism, comprising 8 main classes
and 26 subclasses (see http://biocyc.org/META/class-tree?

The taxonomic groups (phyla for Bacteria and Archaea, kingdoms for Eukarya) are grouped by domain and are ordered within each domain based on the number of
pathways associated with the taxon. Euglenozoa are listed separately as this group does not belong to any of the other eukaryotic kingdoms. A pathway may be
associated with multiple organisms.

object¼Pathways). Selection criteria for the curation of these
plant pathways include generality of occurrence across taxa,
investigation in a model species like Arabidopsis and agro-
nomic or medicinal importance. Arabidopsis pathways are
5 exported to AraCyc, the Arabidopsis metabolism database
(5) that was computationally predicted using MetaCyc as
the reference database.
In mammalian metabolism we added multiple new path-
ways, including those describing human neurotransmitter
10 biosynthesis (in collaboration with experimentalists in this
field), drug metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, arsenate
detoxification and glutathione metabolism. These pathways
were either curated within MetaCyc, or propagated from
the HumanCyc database (3). In addition, several existing
15 pathways of intermediary metabolism were curated with rat
enzymes and genes.
In parallel with curating new pathways, we extensively
edited previously existing pathways. Approximately 60 micro-
bial and 7 plant pathways have been updated and enhanced
20 since 2003. One of our highest priorities is the curation of
existing pathways that are in need of updating with enzymes,
EC numbers, genes and comments with literature citations.
While adding new pathways or revising existing pathways,
we are also expanding coverage of pathway variants found
25 in different organisms.
In addition to curation within MetaCyc, we continue to
import pathways from other databases. At each quarterly
release we propagate newly curated pathways from EcoCyc
(6) and HumanCyc (3) into MetaCyc. We encourage outside
30 curators of our BioCyc family of PGDBs to submit curated
pathways to us for possible inclusion in MetaCyc. For
example, we incorporated several new yeast pathways in col-
laboration with curators from the Saccharomyces Genome
Database (SGD) (4). We minimize redundancy by associating
35 several representative species with a pathway that is shared
among them. We are in the process of refining the database by
deleting pathways that are deemed redundant, dividing large
pathways that contain overlapping sections into separate,
smaller pathways, and assembling small, related pathways
40 into superpathways, to give an overview of metabolic
interrelationships.
A new pathway evidence code, EV-EXP-TAS (evidence-
experimental-traceable author statement) was created to allow
curators to cite review articles containing direct references to
45 the primary literature in support of the pathways. We found
this type of reference to be the most useful for large, complex
pathways.
We are increasingly enhancing the quality of enzyme
information in MetaCyc by adding more kinetic data, includ-
50ing Km values and optimal pH and temperature, and listing
enzyme regulators, including activators, inhibitors, cofactors
and alternative substrates. We have revised and extended the
categories for enzyme regulators based on their kinetics.
Activators are now classified as allosteric, nonallosteric or
55of unknown mechanism, and inhibitors are classified as
competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, allosteric, irre-
versible, none of the preceding or of unknown mechanism.
Definitions of these types of regulators are provided in
Appendix I of (7). It should be noted that while kinetic
60data are present for most enzymes curated within the last
2 years, there are still many enzymes in the database which
lack kinetic data, either because they were curated earlier
and have not yet been updated, or because no such data are
available in the literature.
65We introduced hyperlinks within pathway and enzyme com-
ments, which can link commentary text to any data in the
database. This dynamic linking greatly improves the ability
of users to navigate between related database objects.
Our chemical library has grown significantly in the past
702 years, from 2951 to 4620 compounds. Currently, over 93%
of our compounds have structures. In addition, last year we
began adding stereochemistry representations to the structures.
Taxonomies
We significantly enhanced the cellular component ontology to
75annotate the subcellular locations of enzymes and to encode
the cellular compartments involved in transport reactions. The
ontology, which has been described recently (8), currently
comprises 160 terms. More about the enhanced cell com-
ponent ontology can be found at http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.
80com/CCO/.
MetaCyc is routinely updated with the latest data from the
Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Bio-
chemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB), which
includes new and modified EC numbers. The last supplement
85to have been incorporated is supplement 10 (http://www.chem.
qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/supplements/sup2004/).
Links to other databases
While MetaCyc (unlike organism-specific PGDBs) does not
contain sequence information, we use extensive linking to
90external amino acid and nucleotide sequence databases.
Whenever possible, enzyme and gene entries include links

ENHANCEMENTS TO THE PATHWAY
TOOLS SOFTWARE
The Pathway Tools software provides query and visualization
10 services to users and editing functions to curators (2,11).
Recent enhancements to the software that are relevant to
MetaCyc users include the following:
 Improved displays: The pathway display algorithms have
been modified to produce more compact pathway diagrams
15 that are more likely to fit within a single page.
 Enzyme/gene naming: Protein and gene names within a path-
way display are now labeledwith the initials of an organism’s
genus and species name (e.g. anEscherichia coli enzyme and
gene are written as ‘acetylornithine decarboxylase (Ec)’ and
20 ‘Ec-argD’, respectively). This notation aids in identifying
individual proteins and genes from multiple organisms that
are assigned to the same pathway.
 Chemical drawing tools: The Pathway Tools software
now includes interfaces for both the Marvin (http://
25 www.chemaxon.com/marvin/) and JME (http://www.
molinspiration.com/jme/) chemical drawing editors, permit-
ting the user to enter or modify chemical structures within
MetaCyc or other PGDBs.
 A new suite of comparative genomics tools is available in
30 Pathway Tools in conjunction with the preceding expansion
of the BioCyc database collection (see below). These tools
include comparisons of the full pathway, reaction and meta-
bolite sets present in a specified group of organisms; compar-
isons of genes associated with a single pathway or a single
35 reaction across a specified group of organisms, including the
operon distributions of those genes; and a comparative gen-
ome browser for visualizing chromosomal regions around a
specified set of orthologous genes.
40Expansion of BioCyc
A major application of MetaCyc is its use for predicting the
metabolic pathways of an organism from its sequenced gen-
ome (12–14), using the PathoLogic program (15). We recently
automated PathoLogic, allowing it to be applied to large num-
45 bers of genomes. Jointly with the European Bioinformatics
Institute, we used this feature to expand our BioCyc collection
of PGDBs to >200 organism-specific databases, each of which
contains the predicted metabolic pathways of the organism,
based on its annotated genome (16). These PGDBs are avail-
50 able for adoption and ongoing curation by the scientific
community.
Each PGDB contains the genome of the organism, which is
accessible using the new Pathway Tools genome browser
(http://biocyc.org/ANTHRA/NEW-IMAGE?type¼FULL-
55MAP&object¼DNAA), predicted operons (only for bacteria)
(17) and predicted metabolic pathways (15). In addition, since
predicted pathways often contain pathway holes (reactions in a
predicted metabolic pathway for which no enzymes have been
identified in the sequenced genome), we applied our pathway-
60hole filler algorithm to all the BioCyc PGDBs. This algorithm
searches the sequenced genome and identifies candidate genes
for these missing enzymes (18).
All the PGDBs in the BioCyc collection can be used to
analyze gene and protein expression data using the Omics
65Viewer, a Pathway Tools feature that allows expression data
and metabolomics data to be painted onto the full metabolic
network of an organism.
DATABASE AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
MetaCyc is freely available via the Web at http://Metacyc.org/
70(updated four times a year). It is also available for download,
free of charge to non-profit organizations or for a fee to com-
mercial institutions, as a stand-alone application program for
Linux, Windows and Solaris workstations (updated two times
