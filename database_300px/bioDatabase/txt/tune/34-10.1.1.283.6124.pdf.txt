ABSTRACT
Protein phosphorylation plays a fundamental role
in most of the cellular regulatory pathways. Experi-
mental identification of protein kinases’ (PKs)
substrates with their phosphorylation sites is labor-
intensive and often limited by the availability and
optimization of enzymatic reactions. Recently, large-
scale analysis of the phosphoproteome by the mass
spectrometry (MS) has become a popular approach.
But experimentally, it is still difficult to distinguish
the kinase-specific sites on the substrates. In this
regard, the in silico prediction of phosphorylation
sites with their specific kinases using protein’s prim-
ary sequences may provide guidelines for further
experimental consideration and interpretation of
MS phosphoproteomic data. A variety of such tools
exists over the Internet and provides the predictions
for at most 30 PK subfamilies. We downloaded
the verified phosphorylation sites from the public
databases and curated the literature extensively
for recently found phosphorylation sites. With the
hypothesis that PKs in the same subfamily share
similar consensus sequences/motifs/functional
patterns on substrates, we clustered the 216 unique
PKs in 71 PK groups, according to the BLAST results
and protein annotations. Then, we applied the
group-based phosphorylation scoring (GPS) method
on the data set; here, we present a comprehensive
PK-specific prediction server GPS, which could
predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from
proteinprimary sequences for 71differentPKgroups.

INTRODUCTION
Protein phosphorylation is an important and dynamic type of
protein modification, orchestrating a variety of cellular signal-
ing processes. About 2% of the human and mouse proteomes
encode protein kinases (PKs) with 518 and 540 distinct PKs
determined in human (1) and mouse (2), respectively. In vivo
or in vitro identification of phosphorylation sites is labor-
intensive, time-consuming and often limited by the availability
and optimization of enzymatic reactions. Recently, several
large-scale phosphoproteomic data using the mass spectro-
metry (MS) approach have been published for yeast (3),
mouse (4) and human (5). But in these cases, it is still difficult
to distinguish the kinase-specific sites on the substrates. The
in silico prediction of phosphorylation sites with their specific
PKs plays an important role in this field. Most of the existing
systems adopt the putative rule that protein substrates are
phosphorylated at the specific sites with flanking consensus
sequences/motifs/functional patterns (6). Application of 3D
structure conservation/similarity can significantly improve
the prediction specificity (7,8), but the 3D structure informa-
tion of proteins is very limited compared with the huge number
of protein primary sequences available in the public databases.
Thus, it would be more feasible and convenient to predict the
phosphorylation sites with the specific PKs solely from the
protein primary sequences.
Several such systems have been implemented over the
Internet. For example, DISPHOS distinguishes the potential
phosphorylation sites with position-specific amino acid
frequencies and disorder information (9). Another system
NetPhos outperforms the consensus sequence-based methods

by training the artificial neural networks with the known data
set (10). However, the above two systems provide little
information about the corresponding PKs for the predicted
phosphorylation sites. The enhanced version of NetPhos,
NetPhosK, incorporates the functionality of providing PKs’
information for 17 PKs (11). Scansite (12) constructs the
profiles of known phosphorylation sites of 20 eukaryotic
PKs for prediction.
In this work, we present a comprehensive PK-specific pre-
diction server GPS (group-based phosphorylation scoring),
which can predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in
the substrate sequence for 71 PK groups, including many
newly considered PKs, such as Aurora-A, Aurora-B and
NIMA (NimA-like protein kinases), etc. The detailed algo-
rithm of this system was described previously (13). We evalu-
ate the sensitivity and specificity of different cut-off scores
for each PK group by ‘leave-one-out’ validation. The default
cut-off scores are chosen for the balanced pair of sensitivity
and specificity. We also use the rat Spinophilin (O35274) as an
example to illustrate the usage of the GPS server. Compared
with the two separate in vivo or in vitro experiments (14,15)
and the two in silico phosphorylation sites prediction tools
ScanSite 2.0 and NetPhosK 1.0, the GPS server provides
satisfying prediction performance. Thus, we propose that
GPS server will be more useful and helpful in further research
in the field of protein phosphorylation.
IMPLEMENTATION
First of all, we obtained the data set of phosphorylation sites
with their PKs from Phospho.ELM (16), which also included
the data of PhosphoBase (17). After removing the phos-
phorylation sites with ambiguous information of PKs, we
were left with 1404 instances. We also browsed the recent
publications and obtained 660 instances. We retrieved the
sequences for the PKs of the data sets from Swiss-Prot and
performed homology search in human proteome for each PK.
Next, we checked the BLAST results and protein annotations
manually to validate the PK subfamily information. After
clustering some homology PKs with too few known phos-
phorylation sites into groups, we obtained 71 PK groups
with 216 unique PKs.
The GPS www server is implemented in PHP+MySQL and
the prediction page is shown in Figure 1. The detailed informa-
tion for each PK group can be visited by clicking on the PK
group’s name. Several pairs of sensitivity and specificity at dif-
ferent cut-off values for each PK group by the ‘leave-one-out’
validation are also listed for each PK group. Users can choose

USAGE
Here, we present the rat Spinophilin protein (Swiss-Prot acces-
sion no: O35274) as an example to demonstrate the simplicity
and precision in the usage of GPS web server. Rat Spinophilin
(also called neural tissue-specific F-actin binding protein II
or Neurabin-II) is an 817 amino acid, actin- and protein
phosphotase-1 (PP1)-binding protein that is ubiquitously
expressed but enriched in dendritic spines of rat brain and
adherents junction of rat liver (14,15,18–22). Spinophilin
binds to and bundles F-actin in vivo, involving in the regulation
of dendritic spine morphogenesis (14,19). Spinophilin also
modulates excitatory synaptic transmission by binding PP1,
redirecting it to postsynaptic densities, and regulating its depho-
sphorylation activity toward glutamate receptors (18,20,21).
Moreover, Spinophilin knock-outmice show impaired synaptic
transmission and long-term depression. In addition, young
Spinophilin-deficient mice exhibit a significant increase in
spine density and enhanced filopodial formation (21).
The phosphorylated Spinophilin plays important roles in
spine morphology. The N-terminal 221 residues of Spinophilin
(actin-binding domain) can be phosphorylated by at least four
PKs, including PKA (14), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PK II
(CaMKII/CaM-II) (22), cyclin-dependent PK5 (Cdk5) and
ERK2 (MAPK1) (15). Phosphorylation of Spinophilin by
PKA and CaM-II disrupts its association with the F-actin
(14,22). It is proposed that ERK2 phosphorylates the actin-
binding domain of Spinophilin to reduce its interaction with
actin filaments (15). The phosphorylation sites on Spinophilin
were experimentally identified by tryptic phosphopeptide
mapping, site-directed mutagenesis, microsequencing analysis
and phosphospecific antibodies (14,15,22). We scanned our
training data set and found that the CaM-II sites have been
used in the current GPS server. The sites for the other three
PKs are not included in our training data set. Therefore, we
choose to predict the phosphorylation sites on Spinophilin for
kinases PKA, ERK2 and Cdk5. The GPS server clusters all
CDK PKs, except p34Cdc2 (Cdk1) as the PK group ‘CDKs’,
and all MAP kinases as the PK group ‘MAPK’.
We obtained the primary sequence of rat Spinophilin
(O35274) from the Swiss-Prot database and pasted it into the
‘Prediction’ section of the GPS server (Figure 1). The default
parameters were chosen. The prediction result of PKA (default
cut-off value: 2.4; sensitivity: 88.9%; and specificity: 90.6%)
is shown in Figure 2a, and the prediction results of CDKs
(default cut-off value: 2.5; sensitivity: 94.4%; and specificity:
91.7%) and MAPK (default cut-off value: 2.5; sensitivity:
83.0%; and specificity: 91.9%) are shown in Figure 2b. For
comparison, the prediction results from ScanSite 2.0 and
NetPhosK 1.0 are also listed in Table 1. Both ScanSite 2.0
and NetPhosK 1.0 do not provide prediction for MAPK1,
so we choose p38MAPK (MAPK5) since the substrate speci-
ficity is very similar among the MAPK family. We followed
the low stringency for ScanSite 2.0 and default threshold 0.5
for NetPhosK 1.0. The total information on phosphorylation
sites of Spinophilin is listed in Table 1.
PKA phosphorylates Spinophilin at three major sites, S94,
S100 and S177 (14). Both ScanSite and GPS could predict the
three sites properly while NetPhosK could not. Since only the
N-terminal sequence (1–221 amino acids) was used in the
experimental identification, it is possible that PKA may
have additional phosphorylation sites in rest of the Spinophilin
sequence with unknown functions. For the N-terminal
sequence of Spinophilin, ScanSite predicts five sites as pos-
itive hits (S17, S59, S94, S100 and S177) while GPS claims
eight potential sites (S17, S87, S94, S99, S100, S122, S126
and S177). In the other region, ScanSite and NetPhosK predict
two (S694 and S756) and three sites (S694, S756 and S814),
respectively, while GPS claims three potential sites (S356,
T777 and S814).

There are seven predicted hits (S17, S131, S205, T337, S339, S635 and S658)
for CDKs and five predicted hits (S17, S205, S339, S635 and S658) forMAPK.

Since GPS has no entries for Cdk5 and ERK2 (MAPK1),
we choose their PKs group CDKs and MAPK instead. Both
ScanSite and NetPhosK have Cdk5 without ERK2. Hence, we
choose p38MAPK (MAPK5) as a homolog PK to predict its
sites on Spinophilin, based on the hypothesis that PKs in one
subfamily exhibit very similar substrate specificity. Cdk5 and
ERK2 can phosphorylate Spinophilin at S17, and S15 and
S205, respectively. ScanSite and NetPhosK could accurately
predict S17 properly, while GPS predicted three sites (S17,
S131 and S205). For p38MAPK/MAPK, only GPS could
correctly predict one site S205. Since we used PK groups of
CDKs and MAPK to predict the Spinophilin, the prediction
result suggests that Spinophilin may also be phosphorylated
by other CDKs and MAPK kinases. The example used here
shows that GPS could be a good complementary tool for
the experimental work and for other in silico prediction tools,
e.g. ScanSite and NetPhosK.
