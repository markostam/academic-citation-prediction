ABSTRACT
Expansions of trinucleotide repeats cause at least
15 heritable human diseases. Single-stranded triplet
repeat DNA in vitro forms stable hairpins in a
sequence-dependent manner that correlates with
expansion risk in vivo. Hairpins are therefore con-
sidered likely intermediates during the expansion
process. Unwinding of a hairpin by a DNA helicase
would help protect against expansions. Yeast Srs2,
but not the RecQ homolog Sgs1, blocks expansions
in vivo in a manner largely dependent on its helicase
function. The current study tested the idea that Srs2
would be faster at unwinding DNA substrates with an
extrahelical triplet repeat hairpin embedded in a
duplex context. These substrates should mimic the
relevant intermediate structure thought to occur
in vivo. Srs2 was faster than Sgs1at unwinding
several substrates containing triplet repeat hairpins
or another structured loop. In contrast, control sub-
strates with an unstructured loop or a Watson–Crick
duplex were unwound equally well by both enzymes.
Results with a fluorescently labeled, three-way jun-
ction showed that Srs2 unwinding proceeds una-
bated through extrahelical triplet repeats. In
summary, Srs2 maintains its facile unwinding of
triplet repeat hairpins embedded within duplex DNA,
supporting the genetic evidence that Srs2 is a key
helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for preventing
expansions.
INTRODUCTION
Expansions of certain crucial DNA trinucleotide repeats
(TNRs) in humans are the mutagenic cause of some 15
hereditary neurological diseases (1,2). The risk of an
expansion is closely tied to cis-acting features such as the
sequence of the TNR. In 14 of the 15 diseases, the repeat
is CNG where N represents any of the four nucleotides.
In vitro studies showed a close correlation between the
ability of single-stranded TNR DNA to form aberrant
structures, usually a hairpin, and the likelihood of that
sequence undergoing an expansion in vivo (3). Numerous
biological studies support the central role of a TNR
hairpin in the mutagenic process (4–9). Models of the
expansion process suggest that TNR hairpins are
embedded within duplex DNA (1,2), possibly making a
hairpin more diﬃcult to access and/or remove by cellular
proteins. These considerations indicate that a hairpin
within a duplex context is likely the relevant intermediate
structure on the way to an expansion.
The hairpin model predicts that cellular proteins could
help avoid expansions by either preventing hairpin
formation or accelerating its removal. One such protein
is the yeast DNA helicase Srs2, which was identiﬁed by a
mutant screen to identify proteins that reduce expansion
risk (10). Genetic studies indicate that Srs2 selectively
blocks TNR expansions in yeast, largely through its DNA
helicase function, based on the ﬁnding that a helicase-
deﬁcient point mutant of Srs2 was nearly as defective as
a null allele at blocking expansions (10). In contrast,
mutation of the related helicase Sgs1 was without
phenotype in CTGCAG repeat expansion assays, and
a high-copy plasmid with wild-type SGS1 was unable to
rescue the elevated expansion rates in an srs2 mutant (10).
Another study found that loss of Sgs1 actually stabilized
CCGCGG tracts (11). Despite other genetic and
biochemical similarities (12–14), Srs2 and Sgs1 are clearly
distinguishable by their triplet repeat phenotypes.
The srs2 strains exhibit an unusually speciﬁc mutator
phenotype. Expansions of hairpin-forming TNRs occur at
higher rates in the absence of Srs2. In contrast, there was
no change in the rates of CTG repeat contractions of
dinucleotide repeats or of forward mutations in the CAN1
reporter gene (10). Thus, Srs2 in vivo selectively blocks
expansions. Biochemical experiments showed that TNR
sequences in duplex substrates or in an intramolecular
hairpin were unwound faster by Srs2 than by Sgs1 or

by Escherichia coli DNA helicase II, whereas all three
enzymes were equally active on control substrates (15).
Together, this information suggests that Srs2 is inherently
fast at unwinding TNR-mediated structure, and that this
property may underlie Srs2’s selectivity for preventing
TNR expansions. However, the previous biochemical
assays used simple substrates where the helicase encoun-
tered triplet repeat sequences immediately upon entering
the duplex (15). Essentially, this tested the ‘standing start’
ability of the helicases to unwind TNR sequences as the
ﬁrst duplex DNA they encountered. The previous work
also found that when triplet repeats were distal to the
helicase entry point, the kinetic advantage of Srs2 over
Sgs1 was diminished (15). In vivo, a helicase loading site
might be positioned at some distance from the TNR
hairpin, requiring the enzyme to proceed through
Watson–Crick duplexes ﬁrst before encountering the
aberrant, extrahelical structure. Thus, a test of ‘running
start’ helicase activity is informative to see if Srs2 retains
its kinetic advantage under these conditions.
The purpose of this study was to provide information
about the DNA helicase activity of Srs2 on more bio-
logically relevant model substrates containing a triplet
repeat hairpin embedded in a duplex region (1,2). There is
only limited information available for unwinding of such
substrates (16,17), and the availability of puriﬁed Srs2 and
Sgs1 provides the opportunity for comparative helicase
studies under ‘running start’ conditions. Evidence is
presented that Srs2 retains its kinetic advantage over
Sgs1 in unwinding embedded triplet repeat hairpins,
primarily by proceeding unabated through the structured
extrahelical segment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Helicase substrates
The substrates used for helicase assays are listed in
Figure 1. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were puriﬁed
on denaturing polyacrylamide gels prior to use. For duplex
substrates, the shorter strand was end-labeled with 32P
using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
The labeled strand was mixed at equimolar concentrations
with the unlabeled longer strand, heated at 958C for 5min,
annealed at 708C for 10min and slowly cooled to room
temperature to generate double-stranded DNA. To con-
ﬁrm that the strands annealed properly and formed the
predicted hairpin structure, the (CTG)7, (CTT)7 and
nontriplet duplexes were subjected to digestion with
mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs). The digestion
was done according to manufacturer’s protocol and the
products were analyzed on high resolution denaturing
polyacrylamide gels as described previously (10). For the
three-piece substrate (Figure 1), the three oligonucleotides
(1, 2 and 3) weremixed at equimolar concentrations, heated
at 958C for 5min, followed by initial annealing at 788C for
20min and a second annealing at 678C for 10min, and slow
cooling to room temperature.
Protein expression and purification
The expression plasmid p11c::His9-Srs2 was a generous
gift from Patrick Sung (Yale University). The plasmid
encodes Srs2 with an N-terminal 9-histidine tag. His-
tagged Srs2 was puriﬁed to homogeneity using a slightly
modiﬁed ﬁve-step procedure. The crude extract was
prepared using a French press and subsequently processed
by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Q-sepharose
and SP-sepharose chromatography as described (18). As
identiﬁed by immunoblotting and silver staining of SDS–
polyacrylamide gels, Srs2 eluted from the SP-sepharose
column in about 360mMKCl. The Srs2 pool was puriﬁed
on Ni-NTA agarose column previously equilibrated with
K buﬀer (20mMKH2Po4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5mM
EDTA, 0.01% Igepal, 1mM 2-mercaptoethanol) with
0.5MKCl and 10mM imidazole. Srs2 was eluted with
16ml of 300mM imidazole in K buﬀer containing 0.5M
KCl. The fractions containing Srs2 protein were diluted in
K buﬀer to yield a protein solution that had a conductivity
equivalent to 150mMKCl. The protein solution is applied
onto a 1ml Mono S Column (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK) and fractionated with a 20ml
gradient of 195 to 575KCl in K buﬀer. Srs2 eluted from
the Mono S column in 375mM KCl. The ﬁnal Srs2 pool is
concentrated to about 0.5mg/ml and stored in 2 ml
aliquots at 808C. Expression of 6-His-tagged Sgs1
(amino acids 400–1268 of 1447 full-length protein) was
induced by galactose and the protein was puriﬁed using
nickel chelate chromatography (14). Puriﬁed fractions
were eluted from Ni-NTA resin column with a buﬀer
(20mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 200mM NaCl) including 80
mM imidazole.
Helicase assays
Most helicase assays measure the unwinding of 32P-
labeled DNA from duplex substrates and the products
were separated by 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide
gels, followed by phosphorimaging. For the three-piece
substrate, visualization utilized ﬂuorescence imaging. The
radiolabeled or ﬂuorescently labeled DNA substrates
(0.5 nM) were incubated with enzyme (10 nM unless
otherwise speciﬁed) for a given period of time, as indicated
in the ﬁgure legends, under standard helicase assay
conditions. Srs2 helicase assays were performed at 308C
in the presence of 25mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin
and 2.5mM ATP. The reactions were terminated with
0.3% SDS, 10mM EDTA, 5% glycerol and 0.1%
bromophenol blue. Sgs1 helicase assay were performed
at 308C in the presence of 20mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 2
mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT and 100 mg/ml
bovine serum albumin. After the incubation at 308C, the
reactions were terminated with 0.5% (w/v) Proteinase K,
100mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 200mM EDTA and 2.5%
(w/v) SDS, and the mixtures were incubated at 378C for an
additional 10min. To help prevent reannealing of the
products, a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleo-
tide was added as described previously (15). All assays
were performed two to three times with similar results.

RESULTS
Rationale and substrate design
In the current study, we tested the idea that Srs2 would be
faster at unwinding complex DNA substrates with a TNR
hairpin embedded in a duplex region. ‘Running start’
substrates used in the current study more closely mimic
the hairpin intermediate thought to occur in vivo (1,2), and
which Srs2 would therefore need to resolve to block
expansions. (‘Standing start’ and ‘running start’ substrates
are used in the DNA polymerase ﬁeld to distinguish the
activities of translesion polymerases when they encounter
template lesions. These substrates are useful tools to help
dissect enzymatic mechanisms, so there is precedent for
both the concept and the nomenclature.) Sgs1 provides a
useful comparison because both enzymes unwind in the 30
to 50 direction (13,14) and because both proteins modulate
genetic recombination (12). However, the two enzymes are
clearly not interchangeable for TNR stabilization. Defects
in Srs2 increase expansion rates for several structure-
forming TNRs (10,19), whereas loss of Sgs1 does not
aﬀect (CTG)n expansion rates (10), and actually increases
stability of (CGG)n arrays (11).
The helicase substrates used in this study are listed in
Figure 1. The presence of the 14 nt 30 tail in all substrates,
plus the known polarity of Srs2 and Sgs1 from 30 to 50,
indicate that unwinding will occur from right to left
(Figure 1). The Watson–Crick substrate and the
(CTG)5(CTG)5 partial duplex were included as controls
to validate the current enzyme preparations and to
compare the activity of puriﬁed Srs2 and Sgs1 with
previous results (15). The upper strands, containing the
inserted sequences from (CTG)7 onward, are predicted to
form secondary structure with diﬀering abilities depending
on the insertion. For example, CTG sequences are known
to adopt a hairpin conformation, whereas CTT repeats
have little to no structure-forming propensity (3). The
nontriplet insert has similar potential C-G base pairing
and T-T mismatches as the (CTG)n substrates, but
without any repeating triplets. The three-piece substrate
(Figure 1) is comprised of three separate oligonucleotides.
The stem of the arm formed between oligonucleotides 1
and 2 contains CTG sequences on both strands, followed
by nine base pairs of Watson–Crick DNA for thermo-
dynamic stabilization. Oligonucleotides 2 and 3 were 50
labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 thymidine residues, respectively,
to allow independent monitoring of unwinding of these
two strands.
The kinetic advantage of Srs2 on TNR-containing partial
duplex substrates is retained in the his-tagged enzyme
The puriﬁed Srs2 used for the current study contains an
N-terminal 9-histidine tag, which diﬀers from our
previous preparation (15). The Watson–Crick duplex
and the (CTG)5(CTG)5 substrate were assayed to
conﬁrm earlier ﬁndings and identify any change in activity
due to the presence of the histidine tag. Supplementary
Figure 1 shows the proﬁle of unwinding by Srs2 and
Sgs1 at 10 nM concentration. For the Watson–Crick
duplex, both enzymes were equally active, reaching
70% unwinding within 5min (Supplementary
Figure 1A and C). The reaction curves for the two
enzymes are nearly superimposable over the full-time
range, consistent with equivalent helicase activity at equal
enzyme concentrations (Supplementary Figure 1C). In
contrast, unwinding of the (CTG)5(CTG)5 partial duplex
substrate was 3- to 4-fold faster for Srs2 over the linear
portion of the time curves (Supplementary Figure 1B and
D). These ﬁndings are consistent both qualitatively and
quantitatively with our previous work (15), and they
indicate that the his-tagged Srs2 preparation used here
retains the unusual property of unwinding a TNR-
containing partial duplex substrate signiﬁcantly faster
than Sgs1. Furthermore, the assay times and enzyme
concentrations used here are suitable for further investi-
gating potential diﬀerences between the two helicases.
CTG hairpins embedded within a duplex region
are unwound faster by Srs2 than Sgs1
Current models for TNR expansions envision an inter-
mediate in which the TNR hairpin is embedded within
Figure 1. Substrates for helicase assays in this study. All duplexes except
the three-piece were radiolabeled on the 50-end of the shorter strand.
Equimolar amounts of two strands were mixed and annealed. Tri-
nucleotide repeats and inserted sequences are indicated by the larger, bold
font. In all cases, the DNA duplexes ran as discrete single bands on non-
denaturing polyacrylamide gels, consistent with a well-deﬁned structure.
The three-piece substrate is obtained by annealing equimolar amounts of
oligonucleotides 1, 2 and 3. Base-base mismatches are indicated by the
larger, bold font. Oligonucleotides 2 and 3 are labeled with Cy5 or Cy3,
respectively, at the 50end of the terminal thymidine residue.

normal B-form duplex DNA (1,2). Thus, a more stringent
test of Srs2 is to examine its unwinding activity on
substrates that better approximate the proposed inter-
mediate. The expected structure of the (CTG)7 hairpin is
shown schematically in Figure 2A. Both Srs2 and Sgs1
at 10 nM unwind the (CTG)7 substrate; however, Srs2
retains a 4-fold kinetic advantage (Figure 2A and B).
Faster unwinding by Srs2 was observed over protein
concentrations from 2.5 to 20 nM (Figure 2C). Thus,
more rapid unwinding by Srs2 occurs over a range of
moderate enzyme concentrations. When the enzyme
concentration was increased to a high level, 200 nM, both
helicases completely unwound the molecule within 2min
(data not shown). Thus, high enzyme concentrations
are required to overcome the slower unwinding of the
(CTG)7 hairpin by Sgs1.
The kinetic advantage of Srs2 was also observed for
longer CTG repeat-containing substrates, which are
intended to mimic in vivo intermediates of larger expan-
sion mutations. Figure 3 shows that substrates containing
(CTG)11 or (CTG)15 inserts were also subject to 3- to
4-fold faster unwinding by Srs2, compared to Sgs1. Thus,
Srs2 continues to proceed more quickly through longer
CTG hairpins than does Sgs1. Interestingly, comparison
of the Srs2 results for (CTG)7, (CTG)11 and (CTG)15
substrates show approximately equal rates of unwinding,
despite the longer insertion lengths (compare Figure 2B
with Figure 3C and D). The same is true for Sgs1, albeit at
a slower pace. When the helicase assays were repeated at a
reduced Srs2 concentration of 5 nM, to slow the reaction
and reveal possible diﬀerences in rate, the unwinding
proﬁle was still very similar for (CTG)7, (CTG)11 and
(CTG)15 substrates (Figure 4). These results imply that
unwinding of the hairpin is not rate limiting for these
substrates, and that Srs2 unwinding through the hairpin
may occur at rates similar to that in the duplex region.
This possibility is addressed later with the three-piece
substrate.
Unwinding of alternative sequences
The faster unwinding by Srs2 of CTG repeats could be due
to the repeating DNA sequence, its secondary structure or

to both factors. To address these possibilities, assays were
performed with two additional substrates to help distin-
guish between the inﬂuence of sequence and structure. The
ﬁrst contains a (CTT)7 insert, which retains a triplet repeat
sequence but which has a low likelihood of secondary
structure formation (3). Figure 5A shows that Srs2 and
Sgs1 rapidly unwind the substrate with (CTT)7 insert, and
the time course curves are essentially superimposable
(Figure 5C). Thus, the kinetic advantage of Srs2 was
overcome in a substrate expected to be devoid of
secondary structure. The unwinding of (CTT)7 by Srs2
and Sgs1 is similarly rapid as the Watson–Crick control
duplex (Supplementary Figure 1), consistent with previous
results for unstructured sequences (15). The (CTT)7 results
indicate that repeats of three nucleotides are not the major
factor distinguishing unwinding by Srs2 and Sgs1.
To address structural inﬂuence, we created a hexameric
sequence TCCTGG, repeated thrice (Figure 1). The
presence of potential G-C base pairs and T-T mismatches
are similar to those of the (CTG)7 repeat, but without
a triplet repeat sequence. This nontriplet sequence was
unwound rapidly by Srs2 (Figure 5B and D). In contrast,
Sgs1 was signiﬁcantly slower at unwinding the nontriplet
substrate. Both the qualitative pattern and the quantita-
tive rate measurements on the nontriplet molecule closely
resemble what was seen in the (CTG)n substrates
in Figures 2 and 3. Thus, facile unwinding of the
hexameric sequence is speciﬁc to Srs2. Together with the
(CTT)7 results, we conclude that structure, not sequence,
is the key determinant for the kinetic advantage of Srs2
over Sgs1.
Unwinding of a three-piece substrate suggests a model
for faster activity by Srs2
The hairpin substrates tested so far were all radiolabeled on
the bottom, nonhairpin strand. The fate of the upper,
hairpin-containing strand following helicase action was of
interest to determine whether the hairpin was unwound.
The three-piece substrate (Figure 6A) was used to address
this question. Strands 2 and 3 were 50 labeled with Cy5 and
Cy3, respectively, to allow visualization of release of

individual strands. In eﬀect, we asked whether Srs2 and
Sgs1 translocate along the upper strand (which contains the
30 tail for initial binding), enter the hairpin at the three-
way junction and unwind it to release oligonucleotide 2
(Figure 6B, top). Alternatively, a helicase might
dissociate from its bound strand when it encounters the
base of the hairpin and then rebind on the distal side before
recommencing displacement to release oligonucleotide 3.
If so, the hairpin would not be unwound (Figure 6B,
bottom).
These models were evaluated for Srs2 and Sgs1 at 10
nM concentration. The time course of Srs2 unwinding
shows release of the Cy5-labeled strand 2 as early as 2min
into the reaction, and additional product release from 5 to
15min (Figure 6C, lanes 4–7). There was no apparent
diﬀerence in unwinding rate for the three-piece substrate
compared to any of the other TNR-containing substrates
tested here. Furthermore, there was no detectable release
of the Cy3-labeled strand 3, suggesting that Srs2 binds
initially to the 30 tail of strand 2 and remains bound to that
strand until unwinding is complete, including displace-
ment of the triplet repeat region in the stem-loop. At very
high enzyme concentrations (200 nM; not shown), both
labeled strands were released, probably due to initial
displacement of strand 2, rebinding of Srs2 to the newly
exposed 30 end of strand 1, then unwinding of strands
1 and 3. Thus, Cy3-labeled strand 3 can be released in a
sequential mechanism by high levels of Srs2.
With 10 nM Sgs1, there was primarily release of Cy5-
labeled strand 2 but at later times than seen for Srs2
(Figure 6C, compare lanes 9–12 with lanes 4–7). This
slower unwinding is consistent with results from other
structured inserts seen in this study and from previous work
(15). Unlike Srs2, the Sgs1 data in Figure 6C show a small
amount of unwinding of Cy3-labeled strand 3. This is
perhaps due to a minority of events, where Sgs1 leads to
some sequential unwinding of strand 2 followed by strand
3. At 200 nM Sgs1, both ﬂuorescently labeled strands are
released (data not shown), consistent with sequential
unwinding. Overall, the results with the three-piece
substrate support the idea that both Srs2 and Sgs1
remain bound to the upper strand at the three-way
junction, but that Srs2 unwinds the triplet repeat junction
faster due to its unabated progress into and through the
extrahelical structure.
DISCUSSION
These biochemical results with ‘running start’ hairpin
substrates support the genetic ﬁndings that Srs2 selectively
inhibits triplet repeat expansions in vivo. This study shows
that puriﬁed Srs2 is 3- to 4-fold faster than Sgs1 at
unwinding CTG repeat-containing hairpins embedded
within duplex DNA. Srs2 maintains rapid unwinding
even when initially loaded into the duplex region. Further
analysis showed that a structured but nontriplet repeat
substrate was also preferentially unwound by Srs2,
suggesting that structure, not sequence, is the most
important speciﬁcity determinant for Srs2. The second
major ﬁnding was that Srs2 and Sgs1 were equally active on
Watson–Crick duplexes and on unstructured loop sub-
strates. Thus, the diﬀerence in activity cannot be ascribed
to trivial reasons. The helicase speciﬁcity of Srs2 in vitro is
consistent with its selective inhibition of expansions in vivo
(10). These ﬁndings are similar both qualitatively and

substrates (15). The third major ﬁnding of the work utilized
a ﬂuorescently labeled three-piece substrate to show that
Srs2 unwinding proceeds through the triplet repeat region
without apparent slowing or dissociation from the
strand to which it originally binds. The enzyme can
therefore unwind both the duplex region and the hairpin,
and hairpin unwinding does not appear to be rate limiting
for CTG tracts of 7 to 15 repeats. Together, the genetic
and biochemical studies of Srs2 provide a paradigm for
one way that triplet repeat expansions can be inhibited.
Srs2 likely acts to prevent expansions from the 30 side of
the hairpin, based both on its biochemical polarity (13,14)
and also from recent genetic ﬁndings that Srs2 acts in
concert with postreplication repair (PRR) to inhibit
expansions (19). PRR is predicted to be recruited to an
intermediate containing a 30 end when replication stalls
(20). Loss of PRR factors, including a pol30-K164R
mutant that blocks ubiquitylation of PCNA, showed
similar defects as a srs2 mutant on expansions CAGCTG
tracts (19). Furthermore, there was a synergistic eﬀect on
expansions in pol30-K164R rad27 double mutants. RAD27
encodes ﬂap endonuclease 1, which is well characterized to
inhibit expansions arising from 50 ﬂaps (6,21–25). By
inference, expansions in yeast occur by both 50 ﬂap and 30
slippage mechanisms, with Srs2 helping provide protection
from the 30 end.
While the 3- to 4-fold kinetic advantage is notable for
Srs2 unwinding of TNR hairpins in vitro, the magnitude of
expansion inhibition in vivo is signiﬁcantly greater, up to
40-fold (10). It seems likely that additional reasons must
exist to explain the full extent of protection against
expansions in a cell. Perhaps Srs2 is preferentially recruited
to a hairpin in vivo through protein–protein interactions,
thus positioning Srs2 for unwinding. Previous work from
other labs demonstrated interactions between Srs2 and the
Pol32 subunit of DNA polymerase d (26), and also for Srs2
with sumoylated PCNA (27). Subsequently it was shown
genetically that Srs2 helps prevent expansions in concert
with DNA polymerase d and ubiquitylated PCNA (10,19).
Further experimentation is required to test this recruitment
model more directly.
The human protein hFBH1 has been cited as a possible
functional orthologue of budding yeast Srs2, based on
suppression of recombination defects and DNA damage
sensitivity of an srs2 mutant by the human gene (28). It
remains to be seen whether hFBH1 also suppresses triplet
repeat expansion defects in a srs2 background. In vitro
processing of slipped CTGCTG repeats by human cell
extracts leads to either correct repair, escape from repair
or error-prone repair (29). The repair outcomes did not
require the DNA repair proteins hMSH2, hMSH3,
hMLH1, XPF, XPG or DNA polymerase b, but no
helicases were examined. It will be interesting to see which,
if any, of the human DNA helicases provides a function
similar to Srs2 in preventing triplet repeat expansions.
