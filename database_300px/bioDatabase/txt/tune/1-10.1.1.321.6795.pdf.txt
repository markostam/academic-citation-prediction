Abstract—Intravenous administration to human volunteers of a commercial preparation of recombinant human C-reactive
protein (CRP) produced in Escherichia coli was recently reported in this journal to induce an acute phase response of
serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and of CRP itself, and to activate the coagulation system. The authors concluded that
CRP is probably a mediator of atherothrombotic disease. Here we confirm that this recombinant CRP preparation was
proinflammatory both for mouse macrophages in vitro and for mice in vivo, but show that pure natural human CRP had
no such activity. Furthermore mice transgenic for human CRP, and expressing it throughout their lives, maintained
normal concentrations of their most sensitive endogenous acute phase reactants, SAA and serum amyloid P component
(SAP). The patterns of in vitro cytokine induction and of in vivo acute phase stimulation by the recombinant CRP
preparation were consistent with contamination by bacterial products, and there was 46.6 EU of apparent endotoxin
activity per mg of CRP in the bacterial product, compared with 0.9 EU per mg of our isolated natural human CRP
preparation. The absence of any proinflammatory activity in natural CRP for macrophages or healthy mice strongly
suggests that the in vivo effects of the recombinant preparation observed in humans were attributable to proinflammatory
bacterial products and not human CRP. (Circ Res. 2005;97:e97-e103.)
Key Words: C-reactive protein  inflammation  atherosclerosis  atherothrombosis cardiovascular disease
There is enormous current interest in the predictive asso-ciation between the circulating concentration of
C-reactive protein (CRP) and future coronary events. This
followed our original description of such a relationship in
patients with established coronary disease,1 and the subse-
quent finding by others that single baseline measurements of
CRP are also significantly associated with risk of future
coronary events in individuals in the general population. With
increasing recognition that atherosclerosis and atherothrom-
bosis are inflammatory processes, the capacity to precisely
measure a sensitive systemic marker of inflammation has
proved irresistible. Unfortunately, enthusiasm for what was
widely perceived as an important new risk marker has swept
away decades old knowledge of CRP and submerged critical
analysis of both the epidemiological evidence and in vitro
studies with CRP.
CRP, the classical acute phase protein, is an extremely
sensitive nonspecific systemic marker of toxicity, inflamma-
tion, infection, and tissue damage.2,3 There are very few
inflammatory and tissue damaging conditions in which CRP
production does not increase, and there is no specific associ-
ation of CRP with cardiovascular disease. CRP is an invariant
protein that has long been assayed with high sensitivity,4,5 and
there is no novel entity of high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) that
is somehow specific for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore
all other nonspecific systemic markers of inflammation that
have been measured are similarly associated with future
atherothrombotic events.6–8 With more than 7000 coronary
events now analyzed in prospective studies in general popu-
lations, it has become clear that the strength of the association
with CRP is notably less than was apparent from the smaller
initial studies,8,9 and there are compelling arguments against
both the rationale for, and utility of, measuring CRP as a risk
marker in healthy individuals.10,11 Nevertheless, the intense
focus on CRP has provoked pervasive speculation that the
epidemiological association between CRP values and athero-
thrombotic events implies a causal relationship.12,13
The idea that CRP might contribute to the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic events is not new. We
first suggested it more than 20 years ago when we discovered
the specific binding of CRP to low density lipoproteins
(LDL) and very low–density lipoproteins (VLDL),14,15 and it

is supported by the potentially proinflammatory capacity of
human CRP to activate complement,16,17 and the presence of
CRP in atherosclerotic plaques.18 However, many plasma
proteins enter the plaques,19,20 and presence at the scene of a
crime is not proof of guilt or complicity; CRP in plaques
could equally well have an atheroprotective function.21 Trans-
genic expression of human CRP in apoE knockout mice does
not affect development or severity of atherosclerosis or the
nature of the lesions,22 but because spontaneous atherothrom-
botic arterial occlusion does not occur in this model it is not
informative about a possible role of CRP in atherothrombosis.
A variety of proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects of
human CRP preparations, mostly obtained from commercial
suppliers, have been reported on cultured cells in vitro
(reviewed in refs 12,13). However none of the preparations
were properly characterized, nor did these studies include
adequate controls. Bisoendial et al have now reported that
intravenous infusion into human subjects of recombinant
human CRP, produced in bacteria for in vitro use in CRP
immunoassays, elicited a massive acute phase response and
activated the coagulation system.23 Are these really the
effects of human CRP?
Materials and Methods
CRP
Human CRP produced in recombinant Escherichia coli (Oriental
Yeast Co Ltd, Shiga, Japan)24 was supplied in solution at 1 mg/mL
in 140 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 20 mmol/L Tris, 0.05%
NaN3, pH 7.5 (BiosPacific). Our natural human CRP, purified from
malignant ascitic fluid,25 and finally in solution in 140 mmol/L NaCl,
10 mmol/L Tris, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.1% NaN3, pH 8.0, was 99%
pure by SDS reduced 8% to 18% PAGE (50 g sample loading,
Brilliant blue R-350 stain, single band sensitivity limit 0.1 g).
Both CRP preparations at 1 mg/mL, confirmed by latex enhanced
immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche)26 and by BCA protein assay
(Pierce), were extensively dialyzed against the same batch of
140 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, pH 8.0, to
remove azide and any other dialyzable substances, and their struc-
tural and functional integrity were confirmed by gel filtration on
Superose-12 (Amersham), calcium dependent binding to immobi-
lized phosphocholine, and electrospray mass spectrometry.
Endotoxin Assay
Endotoxin was assayed, according to the 2005 European Pharmaco-
poeia monograph 2.6.14, by Limulus kinetic turbidimetric method
(Cambrex), in pyrogen-free tubes with pyrogen-free water as diluent,
at final CRP concentrations of 100, 10, and 1 g/mL. Results in two
separate assays were consistent.
Mice
Mice deficient respectively in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TLR2,
and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)27 were bred under
specific pathogen–free conditions (Bundesinstitut fu¨r Risikobewer-
tung, Berlin, Germany). Conventional female wild type C57BL/6
mice aged 7 weeks, C57BL/6 mice transgenic for human CRP,22 and
their wild-type litter mates, were used for in vivo experiments.
Cell Lines, Reagents, and In Vitro Assays
Bone marrow–derived macrophages obtained respectively from
wild-type, TLR2-, TLR4-, and MyD88-deficient mice, were seeded
at 50 000 per well in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FCS,
5% horse serum, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L pyruvate, and
10 mmol/L L-glutamine at 37°C and 5% CO2.28 After adherence
overnight, stimulation was compared in 200 L fresh medium
containing 10% FCS using highly purified Shigella flexneri lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS),29 bacterial lipopeptide, Pam3CysSerLys4 (BLP;
EMC Microcollections), and the CRP preparations. Supernatants
collected after 24 hours were frozen until assayed for murine TNF-
by ELISA (R&D Systems), with a lower detection limit of 10 pg/mL.
The NF-B–dependent luciferase reporter assay29 used human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that stably express human TLR2
or that had been transfected with empty vector as a control. The
THP-1–IB enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cell line was
generated by stable transfection of THP-1 with the pIB–EGFP
expression cassette (Clontech) and selected for neomycin resistance
at a final concentration of 0.5 g/mL. A stable population of cells
was isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting. THP-1–IB–
EGFP cells remained fluorescent when the NF-B pathway was
inactive whereas degradation of I–EGFP in response to NF-B
activators was quantifiable by fluorescence activated cell sorting
analysis. Soluble CD14 and LPS binding protein (LBP) were from
Biometec GmbH.
In Vivo Acute Phase Responses
Two days after bleeding for baseline values, 3 different groups of
mice (n7 to 8) received intravenous injections of 100 g of,
respectively, commercial recombinant human CRP exactly as sup-
plied by BiosPacific, this product after extensive dialysis, and natural
human CRP dialyzed extensively against the same buffer; a fourth,
control, group received buffer alone. All mice were bled 24 hours
later for measurement of human CRP by latex enhanced immuno-
turbidimetric assay (Roche),26 mouse serum amyloid P component
(SAP), and complement component C3 by electroimmunoassay,30,31
and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) by ELISA (BioSource UK,
Nivelles, Belgium). An otherwise identical preliminary experiment
but with 3 mice per group gave closely similar results.
Results
Authenticity of the CRP Preparations
The recombinant and the natural human CRP preparations
were both composed entirely of intact native pentamers by
analytical gel filtration chromatography and were 100%
functionally intact by specific calcium-dependent binding to
phosphocholine. In both preparations the CRP protomer mass
was 23 028 Da by electrospray mass spectrometry, corre-
sponding to the mass of 23 029 Da predicted from the known
amino acid sequence including the N-terminal pyroglutamic
acid.32
Endotoxin Content of the CRP Preparations
Assays of the natural CRP, with acceptable recoveries (106.5
to 146.6%) of spiked endotoxin at all dilutions of CRP tested,
detected 0.9080 endotoxin units (EU)/mg of CRP when tested
at 100 g/mL of CRP; nothing was detected at higher
dilutions of CRP. Recovery of spiked endotoxin was also
acceptable (126.7 to 138.3%) at all dilutions of recombinant
CRP tested, but the apparent endotoxin content was substan-
tial: 46.62 EU/mg of CRP at 100 g/mL of CRP, 30.58
EU/mg of CRP at 10 g/mL of CRP, and 15.13 EU/mg of
CRP at 1 g/mL of CRP. The falling apparent endotoxin
content at increasing dilutions of CRP is bizarre as the
endotoxin value per mg of CRP should remain constant
regardless of dilution. Either interfering material is present,
despite the acceptable recoveries observed, or the activity in
the assay does not behave like authentic bacterial LPS.
Whatever the explanation, there is a very striking difference
from the natural human CRP preparation.

Pure Natural Human CRP Is Not
Proinflammatory In Vivo
There was no increase in concentration of mouse SAP, SAA,
or C3 at 24 hours after intravenous injection into mice of pure
natural human CRP (Table 1), at the time when the acute
phase responses of these proteins to a single inflammatory or
toxic stimulus is usually maximal.31,33 The4.00 mg/kg dose
of CRP was 3-fold higher than given to human subjects by
Bisoendial et al,23 but it did not provoke any acute phase
response and its effect was indistinguishable from injection of
buffer alone (Table 1). In dramatic contrast, injection of this
same dose of recombinant CRP, whether or not dialyzed
beforehand, induced a highly significant 2- to 3-fold rise in
mouse SAP and a 20- to 40-fold rise in mouse SAA (Table 1).
This startling acute phase response is comparable to that
produced in humans by the putatively “highly purified”
recombinant CRP preparation of Bisoendial et al23
Transgenic Production of Human CRP Is Not
Proinflammatory in Mice In Vivo
Male mice transgenic for human CRP, with median human
CRP concentrations of 2 to 5 mg/L throughout their lives,
maintained normal values of their exquisitely sensitive autol-
ogous acute phase proteins, mouse SAP, and SAA, apart from
rare spikes caused by occasional fighting injury22 (Table 2).
Pure Natural Human CRP Is Not
Proinflammatory In Vitro
LPS-induced TNF- production is dependent on TLR4
wheras TLR2 induces TNF- release in response to bacterial
lipopeptides (BLP), and both pathways involve activation of
NF-B through the adaptor MyD88. Therefore TLR4/ and
MyD88/ macrophages do not produce significant amounts
of TNF- in response to LPS, whereas TLR2/ and
MyD88/ macrophages do not respond to BLP (Figure 1A).

The recombinant CRP preparation elicited substantial pro-
duction of TNF- from both wild-type and TLR2/ cells but
not from TLR4/ and MyD88/ macrophages, regardless of
whether or not it was dialysed before testing (Figure 1B). In
marked contrast, our natural human CRP elicited no detect-
able production of TNF- from any of the cells tested (Figure
1). NF- was activated in THP-1 cells by the recombinant
CRP preparation in the presence of soluble CD14 and LBP,
consistent with the presence of LPS, but the natural human
CRP had no effect (Figure 2). Stimulation by the recombinant
CRP was unaffected by dialysis before testing. HEK293 cells
stably transfected with human TLR2 showed activation of
NF- by synthetic BLP at doses as low as 0.1 ng/mL, but
there was no response to either CRP preparation at any
concentration up to 100 g/mL (Figure 3). These results are
all compatible with the presence of LPS but not BLP in the
recombinant preparation. In other experiments, not shown
here, the recombinant CRP also induced IL-1 production by
human peripheral blood monocytes, whereas the natural CRP
did not.
Discussion
Intravenous injection into mice of highly purified, structurally
intact, and fully functionally active human CRP, isolated
from human subjects, did not induce an acute phase response
of either mouse SAP or SAA. In marked contrast, injection of
the same quantity of CRP from the commercial bacterial
recombinant preparation induced a dramatic increase in the

ferent knockout mouse macrophages. A, Stimulation with Sh.

(sCD14) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). Recombi-
nant bacterial CRP at 100 g/mL (hatched bars) produced sub-
stantial activation in the presence of sCD14 and LBP, consistent
with the presence of LPS. Similar results were obtained regard-

circulating concentration of both these proteins, compatible
with the well known exquisitely sensitive murine acute phase
response to endotoxin.31,34,35 The recombinant material also
triggered proinflammatory cytokine and signaling responses
in mouse macrophages in vitro, consistent with the presence
of Gram-negative bacterial LPS in the preparation, whereas
our natural human CRP had no effect in these assays. We did
not detect bacterial lipopeptides in the recombinant prepara-
tion, but did not exclude the possible presence of bacterial
peptidoglycans. Formal in vitro testing for endotoxin by the
Limulus kinetic turbidimetric assay detected just 0.9 EU/mg
of CRP in the natural human CRP preparation, compared with
46.6 EU/mg in the recombinant product. However the activity
in the commercial material behaved anomalously on dilution,
and it was not possible to assign an estimate of endotoxin
content compatible with European Pharmacopoeia guidelines.
Bisoendial et al report that the Limulus assay detected 1.5
EU/mL in their material but they do not state at what CRP
concentration this result was obtained.23 Because both the
recombinant and the natural human CRP molecules were
structurally and functionally intact, and were indistinguish-
able from each other, the acute phase response and transient
neutrophilia observed in humans by Bisoendial et al23 are
very unlikely to have been caused by CRP itself. These
effects are consistent with contamination by bacterial or other
extraneous material, despite the apparent lack of pyrogenicity
or increased TNF- production. The present completely
negative result with authentic highly purified human CRP
places the onus on others to prove that the effects observed
with recombinant bacterial or other preparations are really
attributable to CRP itself.
Bisoendial et al23 subjected their material to a single gel
filtration chromatography step to purify it before intravenous
injection, but they showed that thereafter it still remained
proinflammatory both to cells in vitro and to mice as well as
humans in vivo. This is not surprising because LPS, in
particular, is known to bind avidly and nonspecifically to
proteins and surfaces, so that once present as a contaminant it
is exceptionally difficult to remove from biological systems.
Indeed in our experiments, extensive dialysis against physi-
ological buffer, which is likely to be more effective than a
single gel filtration step for removal of low molecular weight
solutes, had no effect on the stimulatory activity of the
recombinant CRP preparation either in vitro or in vivo. The
recombinant CRP provided by BiosPacific is manufactured
by the Oriental Yeast Company in Japan, and, to our
knowledge, this is the only commercial source of bacterial
recombinant human CRP. CRP released by the recombinant
E. coli is isolated from the culture medium by nonspecific
calcium-dependent affinity chromatography on EACA-
Sepharose.24 Although this captures the human CRP, it would
be astonishing if all bacterial proinflammatory products were
removed, and we show here that they definitely are not. This
does not matter for the intended in vitro use of the product as
a calibrator for CRP immunoassays, but it is critical for
experiments on living cells in culture and evidently even
more important when administered in vivo. Furthermore,
different batches of the recombinant CRP might be variably
contaminated with different proinflammatory bacterial prod-
ucts, leading to varying biological effects. The present results
are consistent with recent evidence that most of the proin-
flammatory activities ascribed to CRP, on the basis of in vitro
studies with commercial CRP preparations, are caused by
either contamination with LPS or by failure to remove the
sodium azide that is universally present as a preserva-
tive.25,36–41 In particular van den Berg and colleagues have
shown that CRP isolated carefully from human malignant
ascites or produced recombinantly in mammalian cells had no
proinflammatory effects on endothelial cells, and that these
effects of the bacterial recombinant product could all be
replicated by addition of either LPS or azide.41 These results,
together with the present findings, also demonstrate that
earlier observations of cytokine induction by preparations of
natural human CRP in the prerecombinant era, for example
Ballou et al,42 must have been caused by contamination with
proinflammatory substances other than CRP.
Human CRP concentrations encompass a 10 000-fold dy-
namic range from 0.05 to 500 mg/L, usually reaching a
peak around 24 to 48 hours after a single acute phase
stimulus.3,5,43 This behavior, which has been known for
decades, does not suggest a role for CRP in modulation of
systemic inflammatory, vascular, or coagulation responses.
Patients with many different acute and chronic diseases
display the whole range of CRP concentrations without
associated coagulopathy, vascular dysregulation, or global
upregulation of inflammation. Although CRP and SAA val-
ues generally correlate, there can be substantial divergence
between them44 that is inconsistent with the idea that CRP
itself triggers SAA production as proposed by Bisoendial et
al.23 Also, when the stimulus for acute phase CRP production
terminates, for example, after acute myocardial infarction43 or
with successful antimicrobial treatment of sepsis,45–47 the
plasma CRP concentration falls exponentially with a half
time of 24 hours, which is almost as fast as the rate of CRP
clearance from the circulation.48 There is never a secondary
biphasic spike in CRP concentration as would be expected if
CRP itself were a trigger for its own production as suggested
by Bisoendial et al23
Transgenic expression of human CRP evokes no acute
phase response in mice (Table 2) and intravenous or subcu-
taneous injection into rats of 40 mg/kg of pure natural human
CRP affects neither acute phase proteins (unpublished obser-
vations) nor blood pressure.25 In sharp contrast, despite the
lack of clinical symptoms or major signs other than transient
neutrophilia, the bacterial recombinant CRP preparation in-
duced a massive acute phase response in humans. The SAA
values in the range of 50 to 2000 mg/L23 are comparable to
the SAA responses to severe sepsis, acute myocardial infarc-
tion, major surgery, and massive trauma. SAA is the precur-
sor of AA type amyloid fibrils which cause the serious and
often lethal disease of AA amyloidosis that complicates
chronic inflammatory diseases.49 It would be highly undesir-
able if the therapeutic use of a bacterial recombinant protein
incurred the risk of such a grave complication, and activation
of coagulation is also potentially harmful. The observations
of Bisoendial et al therefore suggest that in addition to
pyrogenicity, safety screening of recombinant proteins for

human administration should include testing for acute phase
responses.
The present demonstration that natural human CRP is not
proinflammatory in vivo in healthy animals does not conflict
with the compelling evidence that human CRP can contribute
significantly to the severity of ischemic tissue damage,50,51
and possibly also other forms of tissue injury associated with
major acute phase responses in diseased subjects. The pres-
ence in damaged tissues of ligands for CRP, coupled with its
greatly increased concentration, evidently enables CRP to
exert pathogenic effects that are absent in healthy undamaged
individuals. Human CRP is thus a valid therapeutic target, as
we originally suggested,50 but the only responsible basis for
development and application of CRP-inhibitor treatments
must be rigorous evidence specifically implicating CRP itself
in pathogenesis.
