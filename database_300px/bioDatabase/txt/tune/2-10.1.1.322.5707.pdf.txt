Neuroblastoma (NB) is an infant tumor which frequently differentiates into neurons. We used two-
dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) to analyze the cytosolic and nuclear protein
expression patterns of LAN-5 cells following neuronal differentiating agent all-trans-retinoic acid
treatment. We identified several candidate proteins, from which Gâ2 and Prefoldin 3 may have a role
on NB development. These results strength the use of proteomics to discover new putative protein
targets in cancer.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma (NB) is manifested in childhood as an
extracranial solid tumor of the sympathetic nervous system that
can show extraordinary clinical and biological heterogeneity.1
The majority of NBs are aggressive metastatic tumors with poor
clinical outcome, despite intensive multimodal therapy. The
most favorable subset of this embryonic tumor (stage 4S) can
spontaneously differentiate or regress to a benign tumor
phenotype, even after no, or minimal, therapy.2-4 This has
generated considerable interest in agents that are able to
regulate these important biological processes.
Vitamin A and its analogues (the retinoids) have roles in cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in normal tissues
during embryonic development.4 It has also been shown that
retinoic acid can restore “normal” functions (differentiation)
in certain tumors, such as NB,5 melanoma,6 and acute promy-
elocytic leukemia (PML).7 In clinical practice, all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA) is mainly used for patients with acute PML.8 In
the treatment of NB patients, ATRA has been used as a
chemotherapeutic agent with some success,9 but 13cis-RA is
preferred due to its more favorable pharmacokinetics.10-12
Furthermore, studies comparing the activities of 13cis-RA and
ATRA in NB cell lines have demonstrated similar potencies of
these retinoids, in terms of cellular differentiation, growth
arrest, and regulation of tumor markers such as MYCN.13
RA effects appear to be mediated by two families of nuclear
retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs) that form a part of
the steroid/thyroid/vitamin D superfamily.14 These receptors
function as homo/heterodimers and directly modulate tran-
scriptional activity by binding to the RA response elements
(RAREs). RA affects NB differentiation either through the
transcriptional regulation of genes directly involved in the
differentiation process or that control the differentiation pro-
cess.5,15 Over the past two decades, a large number of NB cell
lines have been generated, which have diverse biological
characteristics. These NB cells provide “good” model systems
both for the unraveling of the molecular basis of NB develop-
ment, and for the development of therapeutic protocols based
on NB differentiation.
Recently, there has been significant progress in the develop-
ment of systematic approaches to study NB development, at
both the transcriptional and translational levels. Gene expres-
sion profiling on NB specimens have been described as
identifying the molecular signatures of high-risk and low-risk
tumors16-18 and novel prognostic markers.19-21 The search for
markers at the transcriptional level is less reliable than at the
protein level, as there is a “long” and unpredictable route from
RNA to proteins, and very often protein expression does not
correlate with mRNA expression. Indeed, several proteins can
be encoded by the same gene, through splice variants and post-
translational modifications that cannot be directly predicted
from gene sequence. The most commonly used comparative
proteomic approach is two-dimensional difference gel elec-
trophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS),
which provides a good proteomic tool for the investigation of
novel proteins that might serve as candidates for tumor
markers. Previously, 2D-PAGE analyses of protein changes were
performed to study chemoresistance,22 to search for markers
for tumor diagnosis in NB cell lines,23,24 and to study quanti-
tatively and qualitatively differences in healthy and pathological
NB mouse samples.25,26 Moreover, proteomic characterization
of differentiation induced by ATRA has been described in
promyelocytic cells7,27,28 and in mouse embryonic stem cells.29
However, very little is known about the large-scale protein

components of early stage differentiation of NB cell lines into
neural cells by ATRA.
Recently, 2D-DIGE has shown advantages over traditional
2D-PAGE for several aspects: (1) multiple pre-labeling of
samples; (2) introducing a pooled internal standard; (3) co-
detection; and (4) a wider dynamic range. This technology30
has been successfully applied to identify potential biomarkers
of various cancers, such as colon cancer,31 oesophageal carci-
noma,32 and breast cancer.33 In spite of this, one of the
limitations of DIGE-based proteomics is the low identification
rate of low-abundance proteins.34
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of
NB differentiation induced by ATRA, we have combined the
2D-DIGE proteomic approach and the advantages of subcel-
lular fractionation of the LAN-5 cell line proteome in cytosolic
and nuclear fractions, in response to ATRA treatment in a time
course analysis. We detected significantly modulated expression
of 126 protein spots: 58 in the cytosolic fraction and 68 in the
nuclear fraction. We identified 33 differentially expressed
proteins from 38 picked spots and have validated some protein
expression patterns in biologically different NB cell lines,
indicating a common pattern of regulation. Further investiga-
tions of these candidate markers using functional assays and
careful studies of many patients should lead to the identifica-
tion of markers that can be used clinically and may provide
insights into the mechanisms of NB differentiation.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Neuronal Differentiation. The human
LAN-5 NB cell line was grown in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 kU/L
penicillin, and 100 mg/L streptomycin, at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 in
a humidified atmosphere. The human SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y
NB cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100
kU/L penicillin and 100 mg/L streptomycin, at 37 °C, in 5%
CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The cells were passaged 1:4
twice weekly and routinely fed 24 h before each experiment.
Neuronal differentiation was induced in cells at 80% con-
fluence by 5 íM ATRA (Sigma) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). All experiments were performed under dim light, and
the tubes containing retinoids were wrapped in aluminum foil.
The cells were washed three times in 10 mL ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested 0, 8, 24, and
48 h after RA treatment, using a cell scraper. This time course
was chosen to reflect primary or early responses of NB cell lines
to the RA treatment. Each experiment was performed in
triplicate. Three cellular plates for each experimental point (0,
8, 24, and 48 h) were harvested, pooled, and centrifuged for 5
min at 2000g at 4 °C. The pellets were frozen at -80 °C until
sample preparation.
Sample Preparation. 1. Cytosolic Protein Fraction Prepara-
tion. The cell pellets were incubated on ice in ice-cold lysis
buffer (250 mM sucrose, 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, and 1 mM
EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Com-
plete Mini EDTA-free, Roche). The cellular pellets were dis-
rupted by 8-10 passes through a 22-guage needle, and then
centrifuged at 16 000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets obtained
were considered as the nuclear fraction, while the post-nuclear
supernatant (PNS) contained the cytosolic fraction and cell
membranes. The nuclear pellet was used for preparation of the
nuclear extract.
The PNS was ultracentrifuged at 100 000g for 45 min at 4
°C. The supernatant obtained here was used as the cytosolic
fraction. The cytosolic fraction was solubilized in 7 M urea, 2
M tiourea, 40 mM Tris-HCl, and 4% CHAPS and incubated for
30 min under agitation at room temperature.
2. Nuclear Protein Fraction Preparation. The nuclear pellet
obtained above was resuspended in 7 M urea, 2 M tiourea, 40
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.24% Triton X-100, and 4% CHAPS. After
30 min of incubation at room temperature, 10 mM spermine
was added, and the solution was incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. The precipitated material was removed by ultra-
centrifugation at 100 000g for 45 min at 4 °C.
The solubilized cytosolic and nuclear fractions were reduced
by 5 mM tributylphosphine (TBP) for 90 min and were alkylated
by 10 mM iodacetamide (IAA) for 90 min, in tubes wrapped in
aluminum foil. After, the samples were precipitated for 90 min
in a mix of acetone/methanol (8:1) at -20 °C and centrifuged
at 13 400g for 30 min, at 4 °C. The pellets were air-dried and
solubilized in 7 M urea, 2 M tiourea, 3% CHAPS, and 30 mM
Tris-HCl.
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford
method (Bio-Rad).
Cy-Dye Labeling of Cytosolic and Nuclear Fraction Ex-
tracts. The pH of the samples was adjusted to pH 8.5 with 0.1
M NaOH or HCl. Typically, 50 íg of extract was labeled with
400 pmol Cy2 (standard mixture of extracts), Cy3, and Cy5
(untreated and RA-treated cells). The labeling reaction was
carried out on ice in the dark for 30 min, and was stopped with
1 mM lysine (final concentration). The samples were then
mixed, and supplemented with 0.5% carrier ampholytes pH
3-10 (Bio-Rad) and 1% bromophenol blue. The final volume
was adjusted to 380 íL with 7 M urea, 2 M tiourea, and 3%
CHAPS.
2-D Gel Electrophoresis, Imaging, and DIGE Analysis. The
immobilized pH gradient IPG gel strips (length, 17 cm; thick-
ness, 0.5 mm), nonlinear pH gradient range (NL) pH 3-10 (Bio-
Rad) were passively rehydrated with 150 íg of tripartite-labeled
sample (50 íg for each labeled sample and 50 íg internal
standard) in the dark overnight. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was
carried out with a Protean IEF Cell (Bio-Rad), with a low initial
linear voltage up to 1000 V in 5 h, and then by applying a
voltage gradient up to 10 000 V with a limiting current of 50
íA/strip. The total product time  voltage applied was 76 000
V/h for each strip, and the temperature was set to 20 °C. The
strips were equilibrated in 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol,
and 0.375 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), for 30 min in the dark.
Equilibrated IPG strips were transferred onto 18  20-cm
11% polyacrilamide gels, within low-fluorescence glass plates
(ETTAN-DALT, GE Healthcare). The second-dimension SDS-
PAGE was performed using a Peltier-cooled DALT II electro-
phoresis unit (GE Healthcare) at 1 W/gel overnight. The gels
were scanned with a Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager (GE
Healthcare) using mutually exclusive excitation/emission wave-
lengths for Cy2 (488 nm/520 nm), Cy3 (532 nm/580 nm), and
Cy5 (633 nm/670 nm). Images were normalized and analyzed
for statistics, and differentially expressed spots were quantified
using the DeCyder 5.0 software (GE Healthcare).
A DeCyder differential in-gel-analysis (DIA) module was used
for pairwise comparisons of each sample (Cy3 and Cy5) to the
Cy2 mixed standard present in each gel. The DeCyder biological
variation analysis (BVA) module was then used to simulta-
neously match all of the protein-spot maps from the gels, and
to calculate average abundance ratios across triplicate samples.

Proteins with molecular masses from approximately 20-150
kDa were resolved, and approximately 3000 spots/gel were
detected using the DeCyder image analysis software. To avoid
false positives, only spots with a fold change equal or above
1.3 and a p value e0.075 (Student’s t test) were taken in
account. A manual sorting based on the quality of the protein
spots was also performed.
Protein Identification by MS. For preparative protein sepa-
rations, 1 mg of unlabeled sample was used to passively
rehydrate the IPG strips. The first and second dimension runs
were conducted as described above. After 2-D electrophoresis,
the separated proteins were visualized using the universal
staining methods of anionic dyes (Coomassie Colloidal Blue;
Pierce). The resolved polypeptides were fixed in 10% acetic
acid/40% methanol solution for 12-16 h before staining. The
staining in Colloidal Coomassie was performed for 3 days, and
then the gels were washed three times in deionized H2O.
Selected protein spots were excised from the gels and washed
in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, in 50% acetonitrile
until completely distained. The gel pieces were re-suspended
in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, containing 100 ng
of trypsin, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and overnight at 37
°C. The supernatants containing the resulting peptide mixtures
were removed, and the gel pieces were re-extracted with
acetonitrile. The two fractions were then collected and freeze-
dried.
1. MALDI MS Analysis. MALDI mass spectra were recorded
on an Applied Biosystem Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer
equipped with a reflectron analyzer and used in delayed
extraction mode. One microliter of peptide sample was mixed
with an equal volume of R-cyano-4-hydroxycynnamic acid as
matrix (10 mg/mL in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 70%
acetonitrile), applied to the metallic sample plate, and air-dried.
Mass calibration was performed using the standard mixture
provided by the manufacturer. Mass signals were then used
for database searching using the MASCOT peptide fingerprint-
ing search program (Matrix Science, Boston, MA), available on
the Internet.
2. LC-MS/MS Analysis. The unknown protein spots from
peptide mass fingerprinting were further analyzed by LC-MS/
MS using a Q-TOF Ultima hybrid mass spectrometer (Micro-
mass, Waters) equipped with a Z-spray source and coupled on-
line with a capillary chromatography system (CapLC, Waters).
The peptide mixture (10 íL) was first loaded onto a reverse-
phase trap-column (Waters) at 10 íL/min using 0.2% formic
acid as eluent. The sample was then transferred to a C18 reverse-
Figure 1. Western blotting was performed to test the cross-
contamination of cytosolic (lane 1) and nuclear (lane 2) protein
extracts from the LAN-5 NB cell line. (A) The biochemical protein
markers used for the nuclei were anti-LMâ and anti-SP1 antibod-
ies, and an anti-ENO antibody was used for the cytosolic fraction.
(B) To check organelles enrichment in both fractions, cytochrome
P450 and LAMP-2 proteins were used as marker of mitochondria
and lysosomes, respectively.

nL/min and fractionated using a linear gradient of running
buffer B (0.2% formic acid in 95% acetonitrile) in running buffer
A (0.2% formic acid in 5% acetonitrile) from 7% to 60% in 50
min. The mass spectrometer was set up in the data-dependent
MS/MS mode to alternatively acquire a full scan (m/z acquisi-
tion range from 400 to 1600 Da/e) and a tandem mass spectrum
(m/z acquisition range from 100 to 2000 Da/e). The three most
intense peaks in any full scan were selected as precursor ions
and fragmented by collision energy. Raw MS and MS/MS
spectra were elaborated by the ProteinLynx software, provided
by the manufacturers that generated a peak list containing all
of the fragmentation data that was used for database searching
using the MASCOT MS/MS ion search software for protein
identification. The list of matched peptides is reported in Table
4.
3. Protein Identification by Bionformatic Tools. Raw data
from nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses were converted into a
Mascot format text to identify proteins by means of a Mascot
software version 2.1 in home, MatrixScience.30 The protein
search both from nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS and MALDI MS analy-
ses was governed by the following parameters: nonredundant
protein sequence data base (NCBInr -20061017 database with
4 051 787 sequences and 1 396 484 404 residues downloaded;
Sprot- 50.9 database with 235 673 sequences and 86 495 188
residues downloaded); specificity of the proteolytic enzyme
used for hydrolysis (trypsin); taxonomic category of the sample
(Homo sapiens); no protein molecular weight was considered;
up to 1 missed cleavage; cysteines as S-carbamidomethylcys-
teines; unmodified N- and C-terminal ends; methionines both
unmodified and oxidized; putative pyroGlu formation by Gln;
precursor peptide maximum mass tolerance of 150 ppm and
a maximum fragment mass tolerance of 100 ppm.
Data Mining. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed
using a tool available on the Internet (http://gepas.bioinfo.
cnio.es/). The distance between protein expression profiles was

calculated using Correlation Coefficient (linear), and the UP-
GMA algorithm was used to construct dendrograms.35,36
The proteins were classified according to the DAVID 2.1 beta
annotation system (http://david.niaid.nih.gov/david/ease.htm).
This tool adopts the Fisher exact test to measure the protein-
enrichment in annotation terms. A Fisher exact test P ) 0
represents perfect enrichment. If the P-value is equal to or
smaller than 0.05, a protein would be considered strongly
enriched in the annotation categories.
Western Blotting. Cells were washed three times with ice-
cold PBS and scraped into extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)), transferred
to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, vortexed for 15 min at 4 °C,
and centrifuged at 16 100g for 30 min at 4 °C.
Proteins extract concentrations were determined by the
Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty micrograms of total protein
lysates was diluted 1:1 with Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer,
loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto poly-
vinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Bio-Rad). Membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad) in PBS, pH 7.6,
and 0.2% Tween-20 (PBS-T), and then incubated with specific
commercial goat anti-PRX II (peroxyredoxin-2), SgII (secretog-
ranin II), NF-L (68 kDa neurofilament), EF-2 (elongation factor-
2), prefoldin subunit 3 and Gâ2 (guanine-nucleotide-binding
protein beta subunit 2) antibodies, a mouse anti-PCNA (pro-
liferating cell nuclear antigen) antibody (1:100) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and a rabbit anti-EF1R (eu-
karyotic elongation factor) antibody (1:100) (Upstate) at 4 °C
overnight.
After a washing step in PBS-T, the membranes were incu-
bated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-
goat, anti-mouse, anti-rabbit antibody (1:10 000) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and the immunoblots were visualized using
ECL detection kits, with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).
A mouse â-actin antibody (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) was used as the control for equal loading. The
protein bands images on X-ray films were acquired with the
GelDoc 2000 system (Bio-Rad). The densitometric measure-
ments were performed by Quantity One 4.5 tool (Bio-Rad).
Results
DIGE Analysis of Differentially Expressed Proteins Follow-
ing ATRA Treatment in the LAN-5 NB Cell Line. To determine
the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-induced dif-
ferentiation in NB, we examined changes in the proteome of
LAN-5 NB cells. We analyzed the proteome in two different
cellular fractions, enriched in either cytosolic or nuclear
proteins. We checked the quality of these fractions by Western
blotting using specific markers (Figure 1). The biochemical
protein markers for nuclei included lamin â (LMâ), a marker
of structural components of the nuclear matrix, and the
transcriptional factor SP1, a marker of the soluble nuclear
fraction. As Figure 1 shows, LMâ and SP1 were mostly detected
in the nuclear fraction; on the contrary, the cytosolic biochemi-
cal protein marker enolase (ENO) is mostly present in the
cytosolic fraction, and only seen at low levels in the nuclear
extract (Figure 1A). Moreover, we checked the enrichment of
some organelles in both fractions. We used cytochrome P450
reductase as a marker of mitochondria and lysosome-associ-
ated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP-2) as a marker of
lysosomes. We observed that the nuclear fraction was also
enriched in these organelles (Figure 1B).
The differential expression of the LAN-5 cytosolic and
nuclear proteins as a function of ATRA treatment was analyzed
at 8, 24, and 48 h of ATRA treatment using DIGE in a pH range

of 3.0-10.0. The samples were labeled according to the scheme
shown in Table 1. To increase biological and statistical signifi-
cance of the results, we prepared the protein lysates from three
independent treatments of LAN-5 NB cultures. Accordingly,
each experiment required two sets of gels (see Table 1).
The protein extracts to compare were prelabeled with either
Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes. Each Cy3/Cy5-labeled sample pair
was co-mixed with a Cy2-labeled pooled standard sample
containing an equal amount of all 12 samples analyzed both
for cytosolic and nuclear fractions. The Cy2/Cy3/Cy5 labeled
samples run together on the same gel. Furthermore, we
interchanged the labeling design in the third experiment to
reduce the effects of preferential binding of dyes to proteins.
For each gel, the Cy3, Cy5, and Cy2 images were imported into
the DeCyder DIA (difference in-gel analysis) module to reveal
the differentially expressed protein spots featured in each gel.
To identify the differentially expressed protein spots across the
six gels, both for cytosolic and nuclear fractions, the results
from the intra-gel comparison (six DIA files) were imported
into the BVA module of DeCyder Software. For the cytosolic
and nuclear fractions, one Cy2 image was selected as the master
image, and the other five internal standard images were
matched sequentially to it (Figure 2).
Approximately, 3000 protein spots were detected for both
the cytosolic and the nuclear fractions. The protein spots were
then filtered for the statistically relevant trend of regulation (p
e 0.075; Student’s paired t test) among the various ATRA
treatment time points used. The analysis allowed us to find
126 statistically relevant and differentially expressed spots: 58
from the cytosolic fraction, and 68 from the nuclear fraction,
with fold changes >1.3 or e1.3 (48 vs 0 h). In particular, 24
spots were more highly expressed and 34 spots were less
expressed in the cytosolic fractions, with 43 spots and 25 in
the nuclear fractions, respectively.
The RA-induced proteome changes were classified on the
basis of the expression profiles of these 126 protein spots using
hierarchical clustering. As shown in Figure 3, the DeCyder
analysis data from both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions
divide along two main branches, with each dividing further into
two branches, showing evidence of four major categories: two
up-regulated categories in the upper dendrogram, and two
down-regulated categories in the lower dendrogram. We
observed that in the two cellular compartments there are two
subclusters denoting proteins highly expressed at the 8 h and
then lower expressed at 48 h, and proteins that are lower
expressed at 8 h and then highly expressed at 48 h.
To identify the differentially expressed proteins, 38 spots of
interest were excised from the preparative gels, and in-gel
trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis
were performed for protein identification. Successful identifica-
tion was achieved if at least five peptides of experimental MS/
MS data matched the internal sequence of the theoretical
candidate protein. Mass spectrometric analysis identified 33
proteins corresponding to 17 protein spots from the cytosolic
fraction, and 16 from the nuclear fraction. The results of the
protein identification are given in Tables 2 and 3, and the
positions of the differentially expressed spots picked in the 2D
gel are shown in Figure 4.
In this study, we were not able to determine the identities
of the protein components of other differentially expressed
spots using either the MALDI-TOF or LC-MS/MS mass spec-
trometric techniques. This may in part be due to insufficient

tumor-transforming gene protein-binding factor PTTG1IP was
detected in a spot which differed from its theoretical molecular
mass and pI. This could reflect proteolytic degradation of the
protein or post-translational modifications, such as glycosyl-
ation.
We performed functional classification of the proteins
identified according to the DAVID 2.1 beta annotation system.
Statistical analysis (Fisher exact test) of the 17 cytosolic proteins
identified (Figure 5A) indicated that some functional categories
are overrepresented in this list, such as translation elongation
factor activity, catalytic activity, transaminase activity, trans-
ferase activity, and the transferring of nitrogenous groups.
Moreover, the functional category RNA binding was over-
represented in the list of the 16 nuclear proteins identified
(Figure 5B).
To examine the correlations between the proteins showing
RA-induced differential expression and the chromosomal rear-
rangements or epigenetic regulatory loci in NB, we searched
for the physical location of the genes coding for the differen-
tially expressed proteins, using UNIGENE searching of the NCBI
genome database. This revealed that the DLD (dihydrolipoa-
mide dehydrogenase), ENO1 (enolase variant 1), DDX1 (ATP-
dependent RNA helicase), ACACB (acetyl-CoA carboxylase
beta), PSMD11 (26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit
11) genes map to allelic imbalance chromosomal regions
involved in NB (Table 5).

We performed validation of the data for some of the identified
proteins based on the availability of good commercial antibody
by Western blotting: PRX II (peroxyredoxin-2), SgII (secretog-

ranin II), NEF-L (68kDa neurofilament), eEF-1R (eukaryotic
elongation factor), PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen),
EF-2 (elongation factor-2), prefoldin subunit 3 and Gâ2 (guanine-
nucleotide-binding protein beta subunit 2) (Figure 6A). Semi-
quantitative analysis of the protein expression was performed
at the four time points of the differentiation: 0, 8, 24, and 48
h. The bands were quantified by densitometry to obtain an
integral optic density (IOD) value which then was normalized
with respect to â-actin value (Figure 6B). All of these proteins
showed differential expression patterns in the LAN-5 cell line,
according to the DIGE results. We also analyzed the expression
patterns of these selected proteins in two other NB cell lines,
SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE, not treated and treated with RA for 48
h (Figure 7A). Here, the proteins TSA, SgII, NF-L, EF1R, PCNA,
and EF-2 showed the same trends seen in the LAN-5 cells, while
the prefoldin 3 and Gâ2 proteins were differentially expressed
in the SH-SY5Y cells, and not in the SK-N-BE cells. Semiquan-
titative analysis of the protein expression at the two extreme
time points of differentiation: 0 and 48 h, in LAN-5, SH-SY-
5Y, and SK-N-BE cells was shown in Figure 7B.
Discussion
NB shows the highest rate of spontaneous regression of any
human tumor, mainly due to differentiation and maturation
of these highly malignant cells in neurons. It is of interest to
study the molecular pathways driving spontaneous regression
in NB to unravel the molecular basis of NB development and
to determine the differentiation therapies that can be used to
treat patients.
ATRA, the most commonly used anti-neoplastic agent in NB
therapy, can induce neural differentiation in NB cell lines in
vitro.4 Systematic approaches at the transcriptional and trans-
lational levels have been used to identify the target genes for
NB progression. Moreover, studies of differentiation induced
by ATRA have been performed in PML cells and in mouse stem
cells using a proteomic approach.
The main aim of our study was to gather insight into the
molecular mechanisms of NB differentiation using 2-D DIGE
technology. We used the human LAN-5 NB cell line amplified
for the oncogene N-MYC and responsive to ATRA treatment,37,38
and monitored the cytosolic and nuclear protein expression
in those cells at the early phase of ATRA differentiation. We
used 5 íM ATRA, according to the known pharmacological
doses used in phase I trials of RA administrated to NB
patients.39
We detected a total of 58 spots in the cytosolic fraction and
68 in the nuclear fraction that showed differences in their
relative expression between the control and RA-treated LAN-5
cells; 33 of these proteins were identified (17 in the cytosolic
fraction and 16 in the nuclear fraction). In agreement with the
neuronal-orientated differentiation induced by ATRA, we ob-
served at early phase of differentiation a substantial up-
regulation of the NEF-L and SgII proteins, which are known to
be neuronal markers,40-42 and the down-regulation of the
proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA, an auxiliary protein
of DNA polymerase. The highest levels of PCNA were seen in
advanced NB stage tumors with an amplified N-myc gene.43,44
Our results suggest that the decreased levels of PCNA may

reflect differences in proliferative activity and that the sup-
pression of proliferation is an obligatory step in the differentia-
tion of these cancer cells. Furthermore, we saw that Far
upstream element Binding Protein 1 (FBP) was down-regulated
upon differentiation. FBP stimulates the expression of c-myc,
a transcription factor involved in cell growth, proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis.45 Low expression of FBP has also
been seen in differentiated haematopoietic stem cells.46
Closed examination of the identified differentially expressed
proteins shows that those of greatest relevance are annotated
to the “translational elongation factor activity” and “RNA-
binding” functional categories. Most of the proteins related to
these categories were down-regulated during RA differentiation.
Among these, the initiation factor IF-2, the elongation factors
eEF-1gamma and eEF-1alpha1, the heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein hnRNP F, and the eukaryotic initiation
factors eIF4A-1 and eIF4A-2 are known to be down-regulated
by ATRA in acute promyelocytic cells.27-29 In particular, IF-2,
eEF-1gamma and eEF-1alpha1 have roles in the elongation
stages of the protein synthesis mechanism, and hnRNP F,
eIF4A-1 and eIF4A-2 have roles in mRNA processing and
transport. This may suggest that ATRA-induced differentiation
of NB could share these six effectors with ATRA-induced
differentiation in PML cells.
A group of enzymes involved in biochemical metabolism was
found to be significantly down-regulated, implicating the
suppression of related biochemical pathways in ATRA-treated
cells (dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, glucosamine-fructose-6-
phosphate aminotransferase 1, aspartate aminotransferase,
enolase variant 1, L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain, acetyl CoA
carboxylase beta). The down-regulation of lactate dehydroge-
nase (LDH) is also interesting, as it is a characteristic serum
marker that is useful in facilitating diagnosis, prognosis, and
monitoring disease progression in children affected by NB.
Several genomic alterations in NB have been reported to
correlate with prognosis, including amplification of MYCN
oncogene, gain of chromosome 17q and loss of chromosome
1p36. Other recurrent changes have also been suggested to have
relevance to the development and progression of these tu-
mors.47,48 Our results show that some of the genes coding for
the identified proteins mapped to chromosomal regions that
are known to be altered in NB. Among these are the acetyl CoA
carboxylase beta ACACB gene which is mapped to allelic
imbalance NB region (17p13-p11) and the ENO1 gene which
is mapped into a loss chromosomal NB region (1p36.3-
1p36.2)49,50 Moreover, enolase variant 1, which was down-
regulated in our system, has been seen to be up regulated in
undifferentiated haematopoietic cells.46 The DLD, DDX1, and
PSMD11 genes mapped to gain NB regions50-52 The dihydro-
lipoyl dehydrogenase DLD protein level, which is down-
regulated in our model system, has been seen to increase in
the central nervous system of rats after oxidative stress.53 The
DDX1 gene coding for the DEAD box protein 1, which is down-
regulated in our model system, has been shown to be overex-
pressed in a subset of unfavorable NBs and in retinoblastoma
cell lines;54 it has been mapped to chromosome 2p24 and found
often co-amplified with the proto-oncogene MYCN in patients
with a worse prognosis55,56 than in patients with only the MYCN
gene amplified.57,58 The role of DDX1 in the tumorigenic process
is not known though; it is a putative RNA helicase, predicted
to be involved in RNA binding and in the export of mRNA from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm.59,60 It is both cytoplasmatic and

nuclear in DDX1-MYCN amplified NB and RB cell lines.
However, it is known to localize specifically to the nucleus in
non MYCN amplified cell lines. In LAN-5 cells, we observed a
correlation between MYCN amplification and DDX1 nuclear
translocation upon ATRA treatment. These findings may sup-
port the hypothesis of its putative RNA shuttle function into
the nucleus as a sign of good prognosis upon ATRA differentia-
tion (Figure. 1S in Supporting Information).
Other down-regulated proteins identified in our study have
been associated with the aggressiveness of several tumors. This
would suggest that the cells are regressing from their tumoral
state, following RA treatment. Among these, there are pituitary
tumor-transforming gene protein-binding factor PTTG1IP and
ribonucleoprotein hnRNP F. PTTG1IP is a prognostic indicator
in thyroid cancer, even if its precise contribution to tumori-
genesis has not yet been explored.61 Also, increased expression
of hnRNP F has been seen in more aggressive colorectal tumors.
This suggests hnRNP F as a potential marker for colorectal
cancer progression.62 Furthermore, the DDX1, eIF4A1, eIF4A2,
eEF1-gamma, and LDH genes are detected in several NB cDNA
libraries. Moreover, eIF4A1 mRNA has been shown to be
consistently overexpressed in human melanoma cells in vitro,63
in hepatocellular carcinoma64,65 and in early stage non-small-
cell lung cancer.66
The SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE human NB cell lines are able to
undergo neuronal differentiation in the presence of ATRA. The
SH-SY5Y cell line is not amplified,67 and the SK-N-BE cell line
is amplified for the oncogene MYCN,68 an important determi-
nant of RA response in vitro and patient prognosis in vivo.69,70
Either has often been used as one of the models for the analysis
of neuronal function and differentiation. According to it, we
saw that the neural markers SgII and NEF-L and the proliferat-
ing marker PCNA were differentially regulated by RA in the SH-
SY5Y and SK-N-BE cell lines as compared to the LAN-5 cell
line. In the three cell lines, we also observed the PRDX2 protein
up-regulation which has been seen in the SH-SY5Y cell line
upon treatment with the anti-neoplastic drug ectoposide22 and
during differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural cells
by ATRA.29 Moreover, we observed that the ATRA treatment
down-regulates the EF1R and EF-2 proteins, and this effect has
just been reported in promyelocitic cells.
After ATRA treatment, Gâ2 and prefoldin subunit 3 were
differentially expressed in the SH-SY5Y cells as compared to
the LAN-5 cells, although they were not differentially expressed
in the SK-N-BE cell line. Here, we assay three independent cell
lines: two N-MYC-duplicated and one without amplification.
Indeed the three cell lines have different tumoral origins, and
the un-regulation of these two proteins in SK-N-BE cells might
suggest that NB ATRA-induced differentiation may involve
different pathways. Gâ2 is an important regulator of certain
signal-transduction receptors and effectors and is ubiquitously
expressed in human tissues. Nothing of this protein was known
to be associated with the tumor process or to be regulated by
RA. Prefoldin subunit 3/vbp1 protein is a chaperone that
captures proteins in unfolded state and transfers them to
cytosolic chaperonin for functional folding. To our knowledge,
the role of prefoldin proteins is not known in differentiation
per se or in neural differentiation. We saw that it decreased in
cytosolic fraction upon RA treatment. Through proteomic
approach it was found that proteins containing prefoldin
structures increased during neural differentiation.71 Addition-
ally, it was shown that the chaperonin prefoldin 3 binds the
Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene product.72,73
VHL is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent protea-
somal degradation via the VHL ubiquitination complex74,75 and
in the down-regulation of transcriptional elongation.76 Because
prefoldin 3 functions as a chaperone protein, it may play a role
in the transport of the Von Hippel-Lindau protein from the
perinuclear granules into the cytoplasm for the ubiquitination
of hypoxia-inducible factor, an important step in the develop-
ment of angiogenic tumors. VHL gene alteration leads to VHL
disease which is associated with various rare neoplasias,
including haemangioblastoma of the central nervous system,
retinal angioma, clear cell renal carcinoma, and pheochro-
mocytoma77 (OMIM 193300). VHL gene is mapped on chromo-
some 3p25, and the loss of this region is a nonrandom
alteration associated with aggressive NBs.78 Furthermore, its
mRNA expression level is a promising marker to predict patient
survival in NB.79 It is known the inhibition of endogenous
expression of VHL protein in SHSY5Y cells reduced neuronal
properties. In conclusion, VHL protein has a neuronal dif-
ferentiating potential to transform NB cells into functional
Figure 7. Western blot analysis of selected proteins was per-
formed in LAN-5, SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE cells, with (+) and
without (-) N-MYC amplification, either not treated or treated with
5 íM RA for 48 h. The â-actin was used as the loading control
(A). The bands were quantified by densitometry to obtain an
integral optic density (IOD) value which then was normalized with
respect to their â-actin expression value. The bar graph shows
the fold of induction at 48 h of RA differentiation in the three NB
cell lines. The fold was expressed as percentage; proteins
expression level at 0 h was assigned equal to 100% (B). The
arrows show two proteins which were found differentially
expressed in LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells and not differentially
expressed in SK-N-BE cells.

neuron-like cells.80,81 To date, the role of prefoldin 3 in NB has
not been investigated. It is known to have a cytoplasmatic
location, but in the presence of VHL the protein has a nuclear
location.82 As shown in Figure 8, prefoldin 3 has a preferential
location in the nuclear compartment upon ATRA differentia-
tion, while in the cytoplasm, a decreased expression is ob-
served. This data underline the potential new role of prefoldin
3 in the nuclear compartment during the differentiation process
which could be issue of future studies on NB tumors to
demonstrate the role of prefoldin 3 together with VHL protein
in the progression of NB.
Conclusions
We have used the 2D-DIGE technique to analyze the
proteome of the human LAN-5 NB cell line upon RA treatment.
We have identified at least 33 proteins that were differentially
expressed during RA treatment, and that have important roles
in a variety of pathways. The RA differential expression patterns
of some of the identified proteins were analyzed in other
human NB cell lines. We saw that two analyzed proteins are
unregulated in SK-N-BE cells as compared to LAN-5 cells. This
suggests that NB ATRA-induced differentiation may involve
different pathways. Additionally, we hypothesize that prefoldin
3 protein, found through these proteomic approach down-
regulated into the cytoplasm during differentiation, may acts
as an oncogene through the binding of VHL tumor suppressor
protein in NB. In conclusion, our results provide insight toward
the identification of RA-induced differentiation gene-proteins
in NB, as an attempt to search for new prognostic markers.
