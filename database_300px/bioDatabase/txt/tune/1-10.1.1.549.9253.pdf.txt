Abstract
Vitamin D has antiproliferative activity in prostate
cancer; however, resistance to vitamin D–mediated
growth inhibition occurs. To investigate the mechanisms
of vitamin D resistance, we screened two prostate
cancer sublines of CWR22rv1, CWR22R-1, and
CWR22R-2, with differential sensitivity to vitamin D.
CWR22R-2 showed less response to the antiproliferative
effect of vitamin D than CWR22R-1. The vitamin D
receptor (VDR)–mediated transcriptional activity was
also decreased in CWR22R-2. We further showed that
the DNA-binding ability of VDR was decreased and
the amount of NCoR in VDR response element was
increased in CWR22R-2. Analysis of VDR-associated
protein profiles found higher expression of the
corepressors, NCoR1 and SMRT, in CWR22R-2 cells.
Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor,
trichostatin A, increased vitamin D/VDR transcriptional
activity and promoted the antiproliferative effect of
vitamin D in CWR22R-2 cells. Targeted down-regulation
of NCoR1 and SMRT by small interference RNA was able
to restore CWR22R-2 response to vitamin D. Together,
we showed that increased NCoR1 and SMRT expression
in CWR22R-2 cells resulted in reduced VDR-mediated
transcriptional activity and attenuated antiproliferative
response to vitamin D. Our data suggest that the integrity
of the vitamin D/VDR–mediated signaling pathway is
crucial in predicting vitamin D responsiveness and thus
provide a rational design to improve vitamin D–based
treatment efficacy based on molecular profiles of
patients. (Mol Cancer Res 2007;5(9):967–80)
Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-
cutaneous cancer in American men. Although androgen
ablation therapy has been a successful treatment, prostate
cancer eventually progresses to a hormone refractory stage and
loses responsiveness to such therapy. Alternative therapeutic
methods to fight hormone refractory cancer are necessary for a
growing number of patients. Ever since epidemiologic evidence
showed that increasing mortality rates from prostate cancer
correlated with low serum levels of 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
(1,25-VD), the active form of vitamin D (1), there have been
increasing numbers of studies to support the antiproliferative
effects of 1,25-VD on prostate cancer cells both in vivo and
in vitro (2-4). However, loss of response to 1,25-VD among
numerous established cell lines, especially progressive prostate
cancer cells, has triggered a series of studies aimed at
understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of vitamin
D refractoriness (5-7). If the mechanisms of vitamin D
resistance in progressive prostate cancer cells could be clarified,
individualized 1,25-VD treatment regimens could be devised
based on tumor characteristics, and these treatments might
benefit many prostate cancer patients.
Various responses to 1,25-VD are observed in LNCaP,
PC-3, ALVA 31, and DU145 cells. Among them, one
common characteristic of the less responsive cell lines is loss
of expression of the androgen receptor. Casodex, an androgen
antagonist, can suppress the antiproliferative effect of 1,25-
VD in LNCaP cells, indicating that androgen receptor is
involved in 1,25-VD signaling (6). Our previous study also
showed that the effect of 1,25-VD is diminished after
knocking down androgen receptor by RNA interference (8).
However, one study using MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b
cell lines showed that androgen-dependent and androgen-
independent 1,25-VD signaling pathways exist in different
cells (7). In previous studies, overexpression of androgen
receptor in ALVA 31 and PC-3 cells did not restore 1,25-VD
sensitivity, indicating that factors other than androgen
receptor are involved in 1,25-VD sensitivity in these cell
lines (5, 9). Furthermore, in the LNCaP subline LNCaP-
104R1, which developed an androgen-independent pheno-
type, 1,25-VD exerts an antiproliferative effect similar to that
observed in the parental LNCaP cell line (5). Overall, in
androgen refractory prostate cancer cell lines, 1,25-VD may
not depend solely on androgen receptor signaling to exert its
antiproliferative effect.
Because the major genomic function of 1,25-VD is mediated
by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), the differential antiprolifera-
tion effect of 1,25-VD on prostate cancer cell lines may result
from varying amounts or transcriptional activities of VDR
among cells. Indeed, overexpression of VDR cDNA in prostate
cancer cell lines (JCA-1, PC-3, or DU145) is sufficient to
establish the antiproliferative effect of 1,25-VD (10, 11). On

the other hand, the stable transfection of antisense VDR cDNA
into ALVA 31 cells abolished the response to vitamin D (12).
In contrast, ALVA 31 cells exhibited much less growth
inhibition in response to 1,25-VD than LNCaP cells, yet the
expression of VDR is higher in ALVA 31 (11). Therefore, it is
concluded that VDR is not the only factor mediating the growth
inhibition signaling of 1,25-VD. However, there are caveats in
comparing two cell lines from different sources that have
variable genetic backgrounds; moreover, the androgen-inde-
pendent phenotype of ALVA 31 resulting from numerous
factors complicate the mechanisms involved in the antiprolifer-
ative effects of 1,25-VD.
To fully uncover the mechanism of vitamin D resistance,
thorough investigations of the vitamin D signaling pathway
are essential. 1,25-VD is a hydrophobic steroid that can
freely diffuse into cells or be transported by cubilin and
megalin, transporter proteins that bind to vitamin D–binding
protein and mediate import by endocytosis (13). After
entering cells, 1,25-VD can be metabolized by 24-hydroxy-
lase (CYP24) to a less active form, 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin
D3, and excreted. The expression of CYP24 is induced by
1,25-VD, resulting in a feedback mechanism that controls the
activity of 1,25-VD (14). The 1,25-VD–bound VDR
recognizes specific response elements within target genes
and regulates transcription. Like most members of the steroid
receptor family, VDR contains a ligand-binding domain, a
DNA-binding domain, and an activation function domain.
One important partner of VDR is retinoid X receptor (RXR),
which forms a heterodimer with ligand-bound VDR to
stabilize the VDR-DNA–binding complex. Over the last
decade, several coregulators have been identified and shown
to modulate the transcriptional activity of VDR by various
mechanisms. Such mechanisms include chromatin remodel-
ing, recruitment of basal transcription machinery, and nuclear
transportation. Among these coregulators, NCoR1 and SMRT
are corepressors that bind to unliganded VDR and repress its
transcriptional activity. SRC-1 and P300/CBP are coactivators
that contain intrinsic histone acetylase activity to help in
chromatin remodeling that facilitates transcription. Moreover,
members of the VDR-interacting protein complex, composed
of proteins generally present in many transcription factor
complexes, work in concert to activate transcription following
the recruitment of basal transcription machinery. In a recent
study, we discovered that the transcriptional activity of VDR
could be modulated by several androgen receptor coregulators
(15). Overall, the varied antiproliferative effect of vitamin D
might be due to the increased expression of CYP24 ,
decreased expression of VDR or RXR, VDR polymorphisms,
elevated expression of VDR corepressors, or other factors
involved in vitamin D signaling as suggested by a recent
review (16).
To study the mechanisms involved in varied antiproliferative
effect of 1,25-VD in prostate cancer cells, we screened the
CWR22rv1 sublines and identified two sublines, CWR22R-1
and CWR22R-2, with various responses to 1,25-VD. Because
they are derived from the same parental cell line, differences
due to genetic background could be eliminated. Characteriza-
tion of these two cell lines indicated that they are both androgen
independent but differ in invasion ability. By dissecting the
mechanisms involved in varying responsiveness to 1,25-VD
using these two sublines as a model, we identified the
molecules that contribute to the developing vitamin D
resistance in aggressive prostate cancer cells.

Identification of Differential Antiproliferative Effects of
1,25-VD on CWR22rv1 Sublines
Previous reports have shown differential antiproliferative
effects of 1,25-VD in numerous prostate cancer cell lines,
including LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, ALVA 31, MDA PCa 2a,
and MDA PCa 2b (7, 11). However, the characteristics and
genetic features of those cell lines are different. A
comparable cell line pair with differential responses to
1,25-VD is needed for mechanistic studies. After comparing
the antiproliferative effect of 1,25-VD in cell lines available
in our laboratory, we discovered differential effects between
two CWR22rv1 sublines, CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2. As
shown in Fig. 1A, 1,25-VD in charcoal-dextran treated fetal
bovine serum (CD-FBS)–supplemented medium exerted 15%
growth inhibition on CWR22R-1, but only 4% on CWR22R-2,
starting from the 4th day of treatment. As shown in
Fig. 1B, cell cycle profiles of 1,25-VD–treated cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry to show the various responses in
these two sublines. In CWR22R-1 cells, G0-G1 accumulation
(from 44 F 0.5% to 54 F 1.8%) occurred from 3 days after
1,25-VD treatment compared with ethanol-treated controls.
However, 1,25-VD does not have significant effects on the
cell cycle profile of CWR22R-2 cells at either 3 or 6 days.
This suggests that 1,25-VD might regulate some G0-G1
regulatory proteins to trigger G0-G1 arrest in CWR22R-1;
however, this regulation is decreased in CWR22R-2 cells.
Because 1,25-VD also inhibits growth by inducing apoptosis,
which we did not examine here, G0-G1 arrest only represents
partial growth inhibition effect of 1,25-VD. The modest G0-G1
arrest effect of 1,25-VD in CWR22R-1 cells at day 6 is
possibly due to the cell density reaching confluency that
increases the overall G0-G1 population in every treatment
group.
The origin of these two sublines was verified by single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis. A comparison of
genotype calls using default variables is presented in Table 1.
Homozygous loci are identified as AA or BB, whereas
heterozygous loci are identified as AB. In addition, there were
466 loci in CWR22R-1 and 294 loci in CWR22R-2 with
insufficient or ambiguous signals (‘‘No call’’ in Table 1).
Although a ‘‘no call’’ may indicate homozygous deletion,
these were not clustered in any particular region of the
genome and were concordant in the two cell lines at 209 loci.
Disregarding the ‘‘no call’’ loci, there was concordance at the
9650 loci. There were three loci in which a heterozygous
locus in one cell line was found to be homozygous in the
other cell line. SNP_A-1509275 in IL21R , interleukin 21
receptor gene, was heterozygous in CWR22R-1 and homozy-
gous in CWR22R-2. SNP_A-1514387 in HS3ST1 , heparan
sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase gene, was hetero-
zygous in CWR22R-1 and homozygous in CWR22R-2.
Finally, SNP_A-1517295 in KRTHA7 , keratin hair acidic 7

gene, was heterozygous in CWR22R-2 and homozygous in
CWR22R-1. A specific role for these genes in the observed
phenotypic difference is not apparent and they may represent
miscalls. As such, the rate for this type of miscall is
acceptable at only 3 in 10,204.
Because these two cell lines are derived from the same
parental cell line, many confounding factors can be eliminated
when studying the mechanisms underlying the variable
antiproliferative effects of 1,25-VD.
Aggressive Character of CWR22R-2 Subline Is Shown in
Invasion Assay
Further examination and evaluation of the characteristics
of the two chosen CWR22rv1 sublines showed that, first,
CWR22R-1 cells were larger, formed looser intercellular
junctions, and spread out better than CWR22R-2 cells
(Fig. 2A). Second, the cell doubling time was shorter for
CWR22R-2 (1.2 days) compared with CWR22R-1 (1.6 days;
Fig. 2B). Finally, cell invasiveness was measured to show the
aggressiveness of these cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2C,
CWR22R-2 was more active in invasion of Matrigel coating.
Taken together, we showed that CWR22R-2 cells grew faster
and showed enhanced invasiveness; hence, CWR22R-2 had
potentially more malignant characteristics than CWR22R-1.
The Antiproliferative Effect of 1,25-VD Is Not Affected by
Androgen Signaling
CWR22rv1 is derived from CWR22R, a relapsed tumor
after castration-induced regression in the parental CWR22
xenografts (17). Androgen-responsive growth of the two cell
sublines was tested and we found that growth of neither
CWR22R-1 nor CWR22R-2 is induced by 5a-dihydrotestos-
terone (Fig. 3A). In a previous report, 5a-dihydrotestosterone
stimulated growth of CWR22rv1 in a dose-responsive manner
(17). The conflicting results are probably due to the use of
serum-free culture medium in the previous study, whereas
we used 10% CD-FBS–supplemented medium. Previous
reports showed that a mutant androgen receptor protein
with a higher molecular weight accompanied by a COOH-
terminally truncated androgen receptor species (ARDLBD)
is expressed in CWR22rv1 (18, 19). We observed the same
mutant androgen receptor in the two CWR22rv1 sublines used
here and Western blot analysis showed the antibody recogniz-
ing the NH2 terminus of androgen receptor (NH27), but
not the antibody against the COOH terminus of andro-
gen receptor (C-19), detected a truncated form of androgen
receptor (ARDLBD), which was not present in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 3B). A previous study showed that Casodex antagonized
the antiproliferative effect of 1,25-VD in LNCaP cells,
suggesting that 1,25-VD action is androgen dependent in
LNCaP (6). To focus on studying the mechanisms contributing
to vitamin D resistance besides androgen signaling, which has
been well studied, steroids were eliminated from the culture
system by using CD-FBS–supplemented medium. This did
draw the vitamin D3 response levels of the two sublines closer

After 24 h, cells were treated with ethanol (EtOH ) or 100 nmol/L 1,25-VD

analysis of 10,000 cells.

(from 20% to 10% difference), which suggests vitamin D
resistance of CWR22R-2 cells is partially contributed from
androgen signaling. Although our study was done in an
androgen-depleted culture system, to clarify whether androgen
receptor is involved in the antiproliferative effect of 1,25-VD
in our system, we used Casodex to antagonize androgen
receptor activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, Casodex did not exert a
significant effect on the growth response to 1,25-VD in either
CWR22R-1 or CWR22R-2, indicating that in this cell model,
androgen receptor signaling was not a key factor in the 1,25-
VD growth-inhibitory effect under androgen-depleted culture
conditions.
1,25-VD–Induced VDR Transcriptional Activity Is Re-
duced in CWR22R-2
The genomic effect of 1,25-VD is mediated through VDR.
To examine whether these effects contribute to the differential
antiproliferative effect of 1,25-VD, transcriptional activities of
VDR in CWR22rv1 sublines were examined and compared
by using rCYP24-LUC, a VDR reporter gene. As shown in
Fig. 4A, the induction of LUC activities by 1,25-VD was
around 10-fold in CWR22R-1, but <3-fold in CWR22R-2. The
higher 1,25-VD– induced transcriptional activation in
CWR22R-1 was further confirmed by examination of endog-
enous expression level of CYP24 using semiquantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). After treatment with
1,25-VD for 24 h, CYP24 expression was induced dramatically
in CWR22R-1 compared with CWR22R-2 (Fig. 4B). The
reduced 1,25-VD–induced CYP24 in CWR22R-2 cells also
excluded the possibility of a higher CYP24 activity converting
1,25-VD into less active 1,24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in
CWR22R-2 cells. To further support our observations, we
examined the expression of protease M , which is another 1,25-
VD–regulated gene discovered in squamous carcinoma (20).
Similar to CYP24, protease M was found to be induced in
CWR22R-2 far less than in CWR22R-1 at 24 h after 1,25-VD
treatment (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the transcriptional activity
of VDR is weaker in CWR22R-2, which is correlated with
reduced growth arrest effects of 1,25-VD in this cell line.
Expression of 1,25-VD Transporters, VDR, and the
Ligand-Binding Affinity of VDR Are Similar in CWR22rv1
Sublines
To further dissect the mechanisms mediating the reduced
1,25-VD response in CWR22R-2 cells, we investigated the
impairment of 1,25-VD–induced VDR transcriptional activity.
First, we examined the expression of cubilin and megalin that
transport 1,25-VD, by using real-time PCR. As shown in
Fig. 5A, the expression of cubilin was higher, whereas that of
megalin was lower, in CWR22R-1 compared with CWR22R-2
cells. The varying levels of the two transporters between the
cell lines suggest that they might compensate for each other’s
function. Mutations and the expression levels of VDR that
could contribute to the transcriptional activity of the receptor
were examined next. As shown in Fig. 5B, neither VDR protein
level (left) nor VDR mRNA expression (right) was reduced in
CWR22R-2. Moreover, we identified no mutation in the VDR
cDNAs amplified from the two cell lines (data not shown).
Then, the ligand-binding affinity of VDR in these two sublines
was examined and Kd values in CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2
were 0.31 and 0.23 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 5C). This
indicated the lower transcriptional activity in CWR22R-2 was
not due to less ligand-binding affinity of VDR. Overall, we
found no obvious explanation for the differences in VDR
transcriptional activity among the studies of expression of 1,25-
VD transporters, or the expression, ligand-binding affinity, or
coding sequence of VDR.

DNA-Binding Ability of VDR Is Decreased in CWR22R-2
1,25-VD signals are mediated by binding of VDR to the
VDR response element (VDRE) in the promoters of target
genes and turning on transcription. Therefore, we compared
VDR DNA-binding capacity in the two CWR22rv1 sublines.
For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), nuclear
extracts containing similar amounts of VDR from the two cell
lines were prepared (Fig. 6A, top) and incubated with isotope-
labeled oligonucleotides containing VDRE. As shown in
Fig. 6A (bottom), VDR-VDRE complexes formed, as indicated
by arrows, consisting of two groups that have been suggested to
be VDR-RXR heterodimers bound VDRE and VDR homo-
dimers bound VDRE (21). These VDR-VDRE complexes were
attenuated by an antibody (9A7) against VDR. Less VDR-
VDRE complexes were formed in CWR22R-2 nuclear extracts
compared with CWR22R-1 nuclear extracts (Fig. 6A, bottom).
No significant change was observed when 1,25-VD was added
into the EMSA reaction. To verify this result, we did a DNA
pull-down assay in which oligonucleotides containing VDRE
were applied to pull down VDRE-binding protein complexes
from nuclear extracts. VDR presented in the pull-down
complexes was then detected by Western blotting. As shown
in Fig. 6B (bottom), the results showed that less VDR-VDRE
existed in the DNA pull-down complexes from CWR22R-2
nuclear extracts, although they contained more VDR (Fig. 6B,
top). Both EMSA and DNA pull-down assays suggest the
DNA-binding ability of VDR is weaker in CWR22R-2 than that
in CWR22R-1. Furthermore, we did a chromatin immunopre-
cipitation (ChIP) assay to measure the in vivo VDR-VDRE
complex in CYP24 promoter. To our surprise, higher amounts
of VDR-VDRE complex existed in the CYP24 promoter in
CWR22R-2 cells compared with CWR22R-1 (Fig. 6C, IP with
aVDR). Upon treatment with 1,25-VD, VDR-VDRE complex
increased, whereas NCoR1 in VDRE decreased, in both cell
lines (Fig. 6C, IP with aVDR and aNCoR1, lanes 4 and 2). We
also observed that a relatively higher amount of NCoR1 existed
in the VDRE of CWR22R-2 cells compared with CWR22R-1
cells (Fig. 6C, IP with aNCoR1). These results suggest the
presence of NCoR1 exerts a transrepression effect to counteract
VDR-activating target gene expression.
The Expression of RXR and Function of RXRb Are
Normal, whereas the Expression of Corepressors Is
Higher in CWR22R-2
We hypothesize the profile of interacting proteins of VDR
might be different between CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2,
therefore contributing to less VDR-VDRE in CWR22R-2.
Earlier reports showed maximum or proper transcriptional

indicated. After the 6th day of treatment, the MTT assay was done. Each treatment condition was assayed in triplicate, and the percentage of growth inhibition
compared with ethanol was calculated. Columns, mean; bars, SD.

activity of VDR requires interaction with RXR (22). As shown in
Fig. 7, we found that the RNA levels of three RXR isoforms are
variable between the two cell lines, but not always lower in
CWR22R-2 (Fig. 7A). Therefore, the reduction of DNA-binding
ability of VDR in CWR22R-2 may not be due to insufficient
amounts of RXR. We then analyzed the formation of VDR-
RXRh heterodimers to investigate the function of RXRh in these
two cell lines and found no difference of functional RXRh
(Fig. 7B, lanes 4 and 5). Next, we examined the expression
profiles of coregulators in these two sublines by using real-time
PCR. Among all the coregulators examined, we found that the
expression of two corepressors, NCoR1 and SMRT, was higher
in CWR22R-2 (Fig. 7C). Higher expression of corepressors
NCoR1 and SMRT could contribute to the lower transcriptional
activity of VDR in CWR22R-2. In summary, we found that
CWR22R-2, more aggressive prostate cancer cells, expressed
higher amounts of corepressors NCoR1 and SMRT than
CWR22R-1, which resulted in less available VDR binding to
VDRE and reduced VDR transcriptional activity, thus leading to
decreased antiproliferative effect of 1,25-VD.

Reverse transcription was done to amplify cDNA from 4 Ag total RNA

components of histone deacetylase (23). To test whether
enhancement of VDR transcriptional activity in CWR22R-2
cells can restore the antiproliferative effect, trichostatin A
(TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor was applied to modulate
VDR transactivation. First, we showed that the 1,25-VD–
induced VDR activity was increased by TSA (Fig. 8A, lanes 2
and 3). Also with EB 1089, a synthetic vitamin D analogue,
induction of VDR transcriptional activity was potentiated by
cotreatment with TSA (Fig. 8A, lanes 4 and 5). Next, we tested
whether increased VDR transcriptional activity by TSA also
promoted the antiproliferative effect of 1,25-VD and EB 1089.
TSA alone exerts 15% growth inhibition (Fig. 8B, lane 1). In
combination, TSA and 1,25-VD have no significant additive
effect (Fig. 8B, lane 3 versus lane 2). This may be due to the
higher turnover rate of 1,25-VD, resulting from increased
CYP24 expression after TSA enhancement of VDR activity. On
the other hand, the antiproliferative effect of EB 1089, which is
not metabolized by CYP24 (20), was further potentiated with
addition of TSA (Fig. 8B, lane 5 versus lane 4). Together, we
showed that the antiproliferative effect of EB 1089 and the EB
1089–induced VDR transcriptional activity are corresponding-
ly enhanced by TSA in CWR22R-2 cells. This suggests that
enhancement of VDR transcriptional activity restores antipro-
liferation effects of 1,25-VD in CWR22R-2 cells.
NCoR1 and SMRT Are Critical for Growth-Inhibition Effect
of 1,25-VD
To investigate whether the higher expression levels of
NCoR1 and SMRT in CWR22R-2 result in resistance to 1,25-
VD, we designed small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting
NCoR1 and SMRT to knock down their expression. CWR22R-2
clones that stably express scrambled control siRNA (SC10),
NCoR1 siRNA (N1-2), and SMRT siRNA (S2) were estab-
lished by retrovirus infection. We first measured the expression
level of targeted genes in these two clones. The RNA
expression levels measured by real-time PCR showed around
40% down-regulation of NCoR1 in the N1-2 clone and 53%
down-regulation of SMRT in the S2 clone compared with the
FIGURE 6. The DNA-binding ability of VDR in CWR22rv1 sublines in EMSA, DNA pull down, and ChIP assays. A. CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2 cells were
seeded in 100-mm dishes, in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI, for 2 d. Medium was changed to 10% CD-FBS–supplemented RPMI the day before treating
with ethanol or 100 nmol/L 1,25-VD. After 2-h treatment, nuclear extracts (NE ) were prepared from each sample. Top, the VDR input detected by Western
blotting. Ten micrograms of nuclear extracts were incubated with an oligonucleotide probe end-labeled with [g-32P]ATP in EMSA buffer for 15 min at room
temperature. Antibody or control IgG was then added to the mixture and incubated for another 15 min. Bottom, the protein-DNA complexes analyzed on a 6%
native polyacrylamide gel. B. CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2 cells were seeded and treated as described in A. Two hundred micrograms of nuclear extracts

20/PBS. Top, 10% of VDR input detected by Western blotting. Bottom, VDR in pull-down protein-DNA complex detected by Western blotting. C. Cells were
seeded and treated as described in A, then subjected to ChIP assay. Sonicated nuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP ) with IgG, aVDR, or aNCoR1
antibody. The CYP24 VDRE contained in the DNA fragment purified from the pull-down lysates were amplified by PCR and visualized in 2% agarose gel.

SC10 clone (Fig. 9A). We next measured the growth inhibition
effects of 1,25-VD in these clones. SC10 cells treated with
100 nmol/L 1,25-VD for 6 days showed 8% growth inhibition,
whereas N1-2 showed 15% and S2 showed 16% growth
inhibition (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, the transactivity of VDR was
examined by reporter gene assay. In N1-2 and S2 cells, 1,25-
VD treatment induced LUC activity 5-fold, whereas induction
was only 3-fold in SC10 cells (Fig. 9C). Although the
transactivity of VDR was recovered, it was not completely
restored to the same level as in CWR22R-1. This suggests that
other factors also contribute to the vitamin D resistance and
determining these factors required future studies. Overall,
targeted down-regulation of NCoR1 or SMRT can partially
restore 1,25-VD sensitivity in CWR22R-2 cells. This result
indicates the higher expression levels of NCoR1 and SMRT
interfere with 1,25-VD/VDR–mediated growth inhibition in
the CWR22R-2 cell line.
Discussion
To study the mechanisms controlling the development of
1,25-VD resistance in prostate cancer cells, we compared the
antiproliferative effects of 1,25-VD in several established

to amplify cDNA from 4 Ag total RNA extracted from CWR22R-1 and

cells was added and incubated for another 2 h. The pull-down complex
was loaded on an 8% gel, and RXRh was detected by Western blotting.

prostate cancer cell lines and selected the CWR22rv-1
sublines, CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2, as our experimental
models. Both cell lines are androgen independent and express
a mutant androgen receptor, as does the parental line
CWR22rv-1. The faster growth rate and more pronounced
invasive ability of CWR22R-2 compared with CWR22R-1 cells
indicate that the CWR22R-2 line is more aggressive than the
CWR22R-1 line. By studying these two sublines, we found that
the transcriptional activity of VDR, but not its expression level,
is lower in CWR22R-2. Also, modulation of the transcriptional
activity of VDR by a histone deacetylase inhibitor promotes the
1,25-VD responsiveness in CWR22R-2. Down-regulation of
NCoR1 and SMRT, two corepressors with higher expression
levels in CWR22R-2, sensitize CWR22R-2 to the growth
inhibition effects of 1,25-VD. Therefore, the transcriptional
activity of VDR plays an important role in the antiproliferative
effect of 1,25-VD. This is the first study showing differential
antiproliferative effects of 1,25-VD in a pair of sublines derived
from one parental prostate cancer cell line.
In addition to studies of prostate cancer, there have been
several studies in the breast cancer field using vitamin D–
resistant variants of MCF-7 as models to investigate the
underlying mechanisms of vitamin D resistance (24, 25).
Although differences in expression or transcriptional activity
of VDR were not found, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
pretreatment of MCF-7D3Res cells could enhance 1,25-VD–
stimulated transcriptional activity and VDR protein expression,
and sensitize cells to respond to 1,25-VD (26). In addition to
breast cancer cell lines, transformed mammary cells isolated
from VDR knockout mice showed no response to 1,25-VD,
whereas growth of cells from wild-type mice was inhibited (27).
Vitamin D resistance had also been shown in many other
cell types, and numerous mechanisms have been found. In a
vitamin D–resistant variant of the human myeloid leukemia cell
line HL-60, reduced amounts of the specific cytosolic receptor
for vitamin D were observed (28). In osteosarcoma cells,
functional VDRs and RXRs were found, but the degradation of
RXR results in resistance to vitamin D treatment (22). A patient
with resistance to vitamin D has normal VDR expression;
however, VDR transactivation was suppressed by overexpres-
sion of hnRNPA1, a homologue of the VDRE-binding protein
found in primates, which blocks the DNA-binding ability of
VDR (29). Several mutations in the VDR gene have been shown
to cause hereditary vitamin D–resistant rickets (30-32). Overall,
the expression and transcriptional activity of functional VDR,
and proteins involved in VDR function, are important in
determining the response to vitamin D in several types of cells.
Prompted by our finding showing weaker transcriptional
activity of VDR in CWR22R-2 cells, we further investigated
the mechanism of this effect from several directions, as
summarized in Fig. 10, including mechanisms that have and
have not been addressed in previous reports. First, mutations of
the VDR cDNA were not found in CWR22R-2. Second,
expression of RXRh and the formation of VDR-RXRh
heterodimers were normal. Third, overexpression of hnRNPA1
and B1 were not found in CWR22R-2 based on quantification
of mRNA levels of these genes by real-time PCR (data
not shown). In addition to the known mechanisms controlling
1,25-VD responsiveness described in previous reports, we also
explored some that had not been studied in other vitamin D–
resistant cells, but that are also important for VDR function.
1,25-VD transporter protein expression and the ligand-binding
affinity of VDR both appeared to be normal. Intriguingly, we

that stably express scrambled control siRNA (SC10 ), NCoR1 siRNA (N1-

expression level of NCoR1 in N1-2 and SMRT in S2 compared with SC10
cells were measured by real-time PCR. B. SC10, N1-2, and S2 were
seeded at a density of 5  104 per well in 24-well plates and cultured in

ethanol or 100 nmol/L 1,25-VD. Treatment was refreshed every 2 d. After

effect. The percentage of growth inhibition attained by comparing with

did find that the DNA-binding ability of VDR was weaker in
CWR22R-2 using in vitro assay. However, more VDR-VDRE
complex were found in CWR22R-2, where more NCoR1 also
resided in VDRE. Examination of VDR coregulator expression
indicated that higher expression of the corepressors NCoR1 and
SMRT in CWR22R-2 might contribute to suppression of VDR
transcriptional activity.
Although we observed no mutations in the VDR coding
sequence in either CWR22rv1 subline, it is possible that
posttranslational modification of VDR protein affects transcrip-
tional activity. There is evidence showing acetylation to be
one type of posttranslational modification of nuclear receptors
(33, 34). One report showed that TSA synergistically cooperated
with 1,25-VD in growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells (35).
Based on our observation that TSA can promote 1,25-VD–
induced VDR transcriptional activity and growth inhibition, it is
possible that transactivation of VDR can be modulated directly
by acetylation. On the other hand, increased expression of
corepressors SMRT and NCoR1, which are components of the
histone deacetylase complex (23) and are activation cofactors
for histone deacetylases (36), might suppress VDR transcrip-
tional activity in CWR22R-2. TSA might therefore indirectly
modulate VDR transcriptional activity by attenuating the effects
of the corepressors. Further investigation of this hypothesis by
siRNA targeting down-regulation of NCoR1 and SMRT indeed
showed that these two corepressors interfere with 1,25-VD
induced growth inhibition. A recent study suggests that SMRT
expression is frequently elevated in malignant prostate cells and
is often associated with reduced sensitivity to 1,25-VD, and that
siRNA targeted down-regulation of SMRT did enhance the
1,25-VD–induced gene expression (37). Therefore, the expres-
sion levels of NCoR1 and SMRT might serve as markers for
predicting sensitivity to vitamin D treatment in prostate cancer.
Here, we provide a pair of prostate cancer sublines,
CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2, derived from CWR22rv1, as a
model for studying the mechanisms of vitamin D resistance.
The more aggressive character of CWR22R-2 and its reduced
response to vitamin D indicate that the effects of vitamin D
treatment might be lost during cancer progression. Increasing
numbers of studies have been carried out and various
mechanisms of vitamin D resistance have been identified
which support defects in genomic 1,25-VD/VDR signaling as
the major cause. In our model, the DNA-binding ability of
VDR is weakened and may result in reduced VDR transcrip-
tional activity. Further research will help clarify the cause of the
loss of the DNA-binding ability of VDR, which might involve
posttranslational modifications, altered coregulator expression,
or other yet unknown mechanisms. By compensating for lost
FIGURE 10. Diagram of VDR-mediated growth inhibition in response to 1,25-VD. 1,25-VD enters cells via diffusion or transporter proteins, cubilin, and
megalin, and binds to VDR. VDR without ligand is associated with corepressors (NCoR ), such as NCoR1 and SMRT, which dissociate from VDR after ligand
binding. Ligand-bound VDR forms a heterodimer with RXR and recruits coactivators (NCoA ), such as SRC-1, p300, etc., resulting in histone acetylation (Ac ).
The DRIP complex and transcriptional machinery join VDR to initiate transcription of accessible DNA templates. The expression of VDR target genes results
in cell growth inhibition.

signaling pathways or by blocking the amplification of signals
interfering with VDR transcriptional activity, we envision the
ability to reestablish responsiveness to vitamin D in prostate
cancer cells. Further insight regarding VDR function will be
beneficial for therapeutic designs using vitamin D to fight
prostate cancer progression.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays
CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2 were gifts from Drs. Ching-Hai
Kao (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN) and Franky L. Chan
(The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China),
respectively. Cells were maintained in 10% FBS supple-
mented RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) containing penicillin
(100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). Transfections
were done by using SuperFect according to the manufacturer’s
suggested procedures (Qiagen). After transfection, cells were
treated with either ethanol or ligands in medium containing
10% CD-FBS for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared and the LUC
activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using pRL-
SV40 as an internal control. LUC assays were done using the
dual-LUC reporter system (Promega).
Cell Proliferation Assay
Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates in RPMI
1640 containing 10% CD-FBS. After incubation for 24 h, the
medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% CD-
FBS and treated with ethanol (final concentration 0.1%), 1,25-
VD, or 5a-dihydrotestosterone at indicated concentrations. At
the indicated time points, medium was replenished and cell
proliferation was determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-
2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according to the
manufacturer’s manual (Sigma). Stock solution of MTT
(5 mg/mL PBS) was added into each well to a 10-fold
dilution. After 4-h incubation at 37jC, the stop solution was
added to extract the formazan product and the absorbance was
recorded. Data are expressed as the mean F SD of triplicate
samples.
Flow Cytometric Analysis
After indicated treatments, cells were harvested and fixed in
70% ethanol overnight. Cells were then pelleted and incubated
in PBS containing 0.05 mg/mL RNase A for 30 min at
room temperature. After washing, the cells were stained with
10 Ag/mL propidium iodide. Cell cycle profiles were determined
by using the FACScan flow cytometer, and cell cycle analyses of
DNA histograms were done with ModFitLT software.
Invasion Assay
CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2 cells were harvested and
counted, and 105 cells per upper chamber were used for each
invasion assay. Cells were added to Matrigel-coated inserts
(Becton Dickinson Labware) in serum-free medium. The lower
chambers contain medium with 10% FBS. The chambers were
incubated for 22 h at 37jC. The cells that invaded into the surface
of the membranes were fixed and stained with 1% toluidine blue,
and random fields were counted under a light microscope.
SNP Array Genotyping
Genome-wide SNP analysis of the CWR22R-1 and
CWR22R-2 cell lines was done on the Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Mapping 10 K Array. These arrays contain 10,204
unique SNPs with the median physical distance between
adjacent SNPs of 105 kb. Heterozygosity for the array averages
0.37. Each SNP is represented by sense and antisense
oligonucleotides for each SNP variant as well as single base
pair mismatches. Genomic DNA was extracted from each cell
line using Qiagen Qiamp DNA Mini Kit according to the
manufacturer’s directions. Genomic DNA was digested with
XbaI and then ligated to adapter oligonucleotides, which serve
as priming sites for sequence independent PCR amplification.
For quality control, an aliquot of the PCR reaction was
analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Three distinct bands from
repetitive sequence DNA and a smear from single-copy DNA
were anticipated and were observed to confirm the successful
amplification of sample DNA. Following fragmentation with
DNase I and end labeling with biotin, the DNAwas hybridized
to the SNP array and detected with fluorescently labeled avidin.
Using Affymetrix GeneChip DNA Analysis Software, each
locus was assigned one of three genotypes, AA or BB
homozygous, or AB heterozygous. Ambiguous values received
a ‘‘no call’’ assignment.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Real-time PCR Assay

corresponding h-microglobulin CT value (internal control) from
each time point, DCT values were calculated. Then, relative
amounts were calculated by comparing the DCT value of
CWR22R-2 to the DCT value of CWR22R-1 samples.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
The VDRE probe was from the human CYP24 gene. The
oligonucleotide probes for EMSA were end-labeled with
[g-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England
BioLabs). CWR22R-1 and CWR22R-2 nuclear extracts were
prepared according to procedure described previously (39). The
EMSA reactions were done with 10 Ag of nuclear extracts in an
EMSA buffer containing 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 4% (v/v)
glycerol, 100 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L, 2 Ag/AL bovine serum
albumin, and 1 mmol/L DTT. The reaction mixtures of the
proteins and DNA were incubated for 15 min at room
temperature. For the antibody supershift assay, the mixtures
were incubated for another 15 min in the presence or absence of
VDR antibody (9A7; Chemicon). The protein-DNA complexes
were analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel.
DNA Pull-Down Assay
Oligonucleotides corresponding to the hCYP24 VDRE were
synthesized as follows: biotin-VDRE1(hCYP24), 5¶-biotin-
GATCGGAGTTCACCGGGTGTG-3¶; biotin-VDRE2(h-
CYP24 ), 5¶-biotin-GATCCACACCCGGTGAACTCC-3¶.
Double-stranded probes were made by annealing 100 ng/AL
mixture of complimentary oligonucleotides in TNE [10 mmol/L
Tris-Cl, 50 mmol/L NaCl, and 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0)] by
heating to 95jC for 5 min followed by slowly cooling to room
temperature. Double-stranded probes were then immobilized
on streptavidin-agarose by incubating in 0.2% bovine
serum albumin/PBS at 4jC for 1 h and then washed thrice
with PBS. Nuclear extract (200 Ag) from CWR22R-1 and
CWR22R-2 cells were prepared and incubated in binding
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 100 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L DTT,
15% glycerol, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 25 Ag/mL
poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid)] with or without
immobilized probe on streptavidin agarose at 4jC for 2 h.
The complexes were collected by pulse centrifugation in a
microcentrifuge, washed thrice with PBS containing 0.05%
Tween 20, eluted by addition of sample buffer, and boiled for 5
min. Proteins were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by immunoblot.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay
ChIP assay was carried out using the Upstate Biotechnology
ChIP assay kit with modifications. In brief, cells treated with
ethanol or 1,25-VD were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde,
lysed, and chromatin pellets were sonicated to an average of
200- to 1,000-bp fragments of DNA. The chromatin fragments
were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 Ag VDR
antibody (H-18 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight
at 4jC. The precipitates were eluted by the elution buffer
(1% SDS, 100 mmol/L NaHCO3, and 10 mmol/L DTT). The
cross-links were reversed with 4-h incubation at 65jC in
the elution buffer with addition of 200 mmol/L NaCl. The
immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were purified using
Qiagen MiniElute Reaction Cleanup kits and subjected to
PCR using a pair of primers (sense 5¶-CGCCCAGCGAACA-
TAGCC-3¶ and antisense 5¶-CCAATGAGCACGCAGAGG-3¶),
which were designed to amplify the VDRE in CYP24
promoter.
GST Pull-Down Assay
GST-VDR-L fusion proteins and GST control protein were
purified (40). The GST fusion proteins were pulled down by
glutathione beads at 4jC for 1 h and washed thrice with
washing buffer. The purified GST fusion proteins and beads
were incubated in 100 AL binding buffer with ethanol or
1 Amol/L 1,25-VD for 1 h, at 4jC. Nuclear extracts prepared
from cells were added and incubated for another 2 h at 4jC.
Glutathione beads were washed with washing buffer thrice.
Protein complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
RXRh was detected by Western blotting.
Western Blotting
Total cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Igepal CA-630,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in PBS). The
lysates were clarified by centrifugation. The protein concen-
trations of the supernatants was evaluated with the Bio-Rad
reagent kit. From each sample, 60 Ag protein was separated by
10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were blocked in TBST [10 mmol/L Tris-Cl
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20] containing 5%
nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Primary
antibodies in TBST were added and incubated at 4jC
overnight, and then the alkaline phosphatase–conjugated
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBS
were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The
membranes were washed thrice in TBST (10 min at room

temperature) and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by
alkaline phosphatase activity with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-
indolylphosphate-nitroblue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate
(Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Construction of DNA Vector–Based RNA Interference
Plasmids and Stable Cell Lines
Small interfering RNA target sites were selected by using the
siRNA design tool on Ambion website and OligoEngine
Workstation 2 software. The corresponding oligonucleotides
for generating the scrambled control siRNA insert are 5¶-
GATCCCCAACAAGCACACACGTGTCTTTCAAGAGAA-
GACACGTGTGTGCTTGTTTTTTTA-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-
AGCTTAAAAAAACAAGCACACACGTGTCTTCTCTT-
GAAAGACACGTGTGTGCTTGTTGGG-3¶ (reverse). The
corresponding oligonucleotides for generating the NCoR1
siRNA insert are 5¶-CGCGGGCCCTGGGCAGCAATTGC-
TAAACAAGAGTTTA-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-CGGAATT-
CAAAAACTGGGCAGCAATTGCTAAACTCTTG-3¶ (re-
verse). The corresponding oligonucleotides for generating the
SMRT siRNA insert are 5¶-GATCCCCGGTCCAACACACTT-
GACAAT TCAAGAGAT TG TCAAGTGTGT TG -
GACCTTTTTA-3 ¶ (forward) and 5 ¶-AGCTTAAAAA-
GGTCCAACACACTTGACAATCTCTTGAATTGT-
CAAGTGTGTTGGACCGGG-3¶ (reverse). These were subse-
quently cloned into the pMSCV/U6 (41) or pSuperior.retro.puro
(OligoEngine). Stable cell lines expressing these siRNAs were
generated according to manufacturer’s manual (OligoEngine).
