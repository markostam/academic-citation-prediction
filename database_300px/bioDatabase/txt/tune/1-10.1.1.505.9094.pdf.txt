ABSTRACT
Retrotransposons make up over 40% of the mam-
malian genome. Some copies are still capable of
mobilizing and new insertions promote genetic var-
iation. Several members of the APOBEC3 family of
DNA cytosine deaminases function to limit the rep-
lication of a variety of retroelements, such as the
long-terminal repeat (LTR)-containing MusD and
Ty1 elements, and that of the non-LTR retrotranspo-
sons, L1 and Alu. However, the APOBEC3 genes are
limited to mammalian lineages, whereas retrotran-
sposons are far more widespread. This raises the
question of what cellular factors control retroele-
ment transposition in species that lack APOBEC3
genes. A strong phylogenetic case can be made
that an ancestral activation-induced deaminase
(AID)-like gene duplicated and diverged to root the
APOBEC3 lineage in mammals. Therefore, we tested
the hypothesis that present-day AID proteins pos-
sess anti-retroelement activity. We found that AID
can inhibit the retrotransposition of L1 through a
DNA deamination-independent mechanism. This
mechanism may manifest in the cytoplasmic com-
partment co- or posttranslationally. Together with
evidence for AID expression in the ovary, our data
combined to suggest that AID has innate immune
functions in addition to its integral roles in creating
antibody diversity.
INTRODUCTION
The formation of highly speciﬁc antibodies of multiple
isotypes requires the activity of activation-induced deami-
nase (AID), which deaminates cytosine bases to uracils
(C to U) in single-stranded DNA (1–9). At expressed anti-
body loci, these deamination events trigger somatic
hypermutation (SHM) at the immunoglobulin variable
regions and class switch recombination (CSR) at the
switch regions. AID and antibody diversiﬁcation are
highly conserved in vertebrates from ﬁsh to primates
(although ﬁsh do not undergo CSR) (10–13).
AID is a member of a much larger family of deaminases
that includes the APOBEC3 (A3) proteins, which play a
critical role in the innate immune response [for recent
reviews see (14,15)]. Many of the A3 proteins can inhibit
the replication of a variety of retroviruses. For example,
human A3G has potent activity against human immuno-
deﬁciency virus (HIV)-1 and Murine Leukemia Virus
(MLV), predominantly through C to U deamination of
the viral plus-stand cDNA during reverse transcription
(16–21).
A number of the A3 proteins have also demonstrated
activity against two fundamentally diﬀerent classes of
endogenous retroelement: long-terminal repeat (LTR)-
containing retrotransposons, such as MusD of mice and
Ty1 of yeast, and non-LTR retroelements, such as long
interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE1, L1) (22–34).
LTR-retrotransposons, which are structurally similar to
HIV-1 and other retroviruses, predominantly undergo
reverse transcription in the cytoplasm of an infected cell.
Inhibition of the LTR-retrotransposons also most likely
occurs by DNA deamination during reverse transcription,
but deamination-independent mechanisms are also possi-
ble (16,17,35). Furthermore, several inactive endogenous
retroelements bear strand-speciﬁc G-to-A mutational sig-
natures characteristic of A3-dependent hypermutation
(36–38). In contrast, the non-LTR retrotransposon L1
undergoes target-primed reverse transcription in the
nucleus of the host cell (39,40). Inhibition of L1 retrotran-
sposition by human A3B or A3F does not appear to
involve mutation of the retroelement DNA or require
A3 catalytic activity (22,23,25,27,31,33,34). However, the
anti-L1 activity of A3A requires an intact catalytic site
glutamate (E72) (25). Thus, at least two mechanisms
may be used by A3s to inhibit the replication of L1.
Retroviruses and endogenous retrotransposons are
widely distributed from single cell eukaryotes (e.g. yeast)

However, the A3 genes are only present in placental mam-
mals (41). Phylogenetic studies have indicated that the ﬁrst
A3 gene(s) arose from an AID-like ancestral gene through
a series of duplication and diversiﬁcation events (41–44).
The evolutionary history (and the common enzymatic
activity) of this gene family led us to hypothesize that
the A3s acquired their anti-retroviral activities from the
AID-like gene from which they evolved (45). Here, we
have addressed this question by testing the ability of a
panel of representative vertebrate AID proteins to inhibit
the replication of a diverse set of retroelements: L1,
MusD and Ty1. Our data showed that AID is able to
inhibit the replication of L1 and MusD through a DNA
deamination-independent mechanism, but it does not have
a signiﬁcant eﬀect against Ty1.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic studies
The following AID sequences were used: human (NM_
020661.1), pig (BP157753.1), mouse (NM_009645.2),
rat (XM_001060382), chicken (AJ446140.1), zebraﬁsh
(NM_001008403) [the zebraﬁsh sequence cloned and
used in the functional studies had one amino acid substi-
tution (R191Q) from this reference sequence], puﬀerﬁsh
(AY621658) and catﬁsh (AY436507). AID amino acid
sequences were aligned in ClustalX version 1.83.1 (46).
The nucleotide sequences were aligned to the amino acid
alignment using PAL2NAL (47). Gaps were deleted from
both alignments in JalView (48). Recombination break-
points were ruled out using GARD (49). Phylip seqboot
was used to create bootstraps for the nucleotide sequence
alignment and then Phylip dnaml was used to generate 100
unique trees from the bootstrapped sequences (50). Phylip
consense was used to create a consensus tree and dnaml
was used to add the branch lengths.

viously (54). All constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing.
Escherichia colimutation assays
BW310 E. coli cells, which are deﬁcient for uracil DNA
glycosylase (UNG), were transformed with pTrc99A-based
AID expression plasmids and grown overnight at 378C on
media containing ampicillin. Four independent colonies
were used to inoculate liquid LB cultures containing ampi-
cillin and glucose. Saturated cultures were diluted 106-fold
and used to inoculate eight liquid LB cultures containing
ampicillin and 1mM IPTG to induce AID expression. An
aliquot of the saturated induced culture was plated onto
medium containing 100 mg/ml rifampicin (Rif), and an
appropriate dilution was plated onto medium containing
ampicillin for a viable cell count. All plates were incubated
overnight at 378C to allow colony formation. Mutation
frequencies were calculated as the number of Rif-resistant
colonies per viable cell. Full procedures were described
previously (4,55).
Cell culture and microscopy
HeLa cells and HEK293 cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100U/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. For microscopy, HeLa cells
were seeded in eight-well chambered coverglasses
(Nunc LabTek) at 8000 cells per well. 24 h later, cells
were transfected with 200 ng of pEGFP-N3-based plasmid
DNAs. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, half of
the wells were treated with 20 ng/ml leptomycin B
(LC Laboratories) for 2 h. The growth medium was then
replaced with phenol-red-free and serum-free DMEM and
the cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 micro-
scope (with kind permission from Dr M. Titus).
MusD transposition assays
HeLa cells were plated in six-well plates at 1.5  105 cells
per well. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected
with 0.5mg MusD plasmid, 0.4mg of an EGFP expression
plasmid (pEAK8-GFP) and 1 mg of the AID-HA,
APOBEC3G-HA expression plasmid or empty vector
(pEAK8-HA) using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus). For the titra-
tion of human AID, AIDE58Q and A3G against MusD,
various amounts (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5mg) of the AID or
APOBEC3G expression plasmid and/or empty vector
were transfected into cells (2.4 mg total DNA per transfec-
tion). Two days posttransfection, 10% of the cells were
analyzed for EGFP expression by ﬂow cytometry and the
rest plated into 100-mm dishes in the presence of 850 mg/ml
G418. After 14 days, G418-resistant colonies were ﬁxed,
stained with crystal violet solution and counted.
L1 retrotransposition assays
HEK293 cells were plated in six-well plates at 2 105 cells
per well. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected
with 0.5 mg of the L1 (or control plasmid) and 0.5 mg of the
AID-HA, APOBEC3-HA expression plasmid or empty
vector (pcDNA3.1-HA) using TransIT-LT1-mediated
transfection. For the titration of wild-type and mutant
deaminases against L1, various amounts (0.25, 0.5 or
1 mg) of the pcDNA3.1-HA-based AID or APOBEC3
expression plasmid and/or empty vector were transfected
into cells (1.5 mg total DNA per transfection). Twenty-four
hours posttransfection, cells that had received the L1 plas-
mid were selected for with 0.75 mg/ml puromycin. Three
days posttransfection, 35% of the cells were analyzed for
GFP expression by ﬂow cytometry, 35% of the cells were
lyzed for western blot analysis and the remaining 30% of
cells were left in the plate in medium containing 0.75 mg/ml
puromycin. On day ﬁve posttransfection, the remaining
cells were analyzed for GFP expression by ﬂow cytometry.
Although some inter-experiment variation was observed
for transposition frequencies (due to any number of
factors), the relative fold-eﬀects attributable to AID/A3
proteins were reproducible and statistically signiﬁcant
(e.g. Supplementary Figure S1).
Ty1 retrotransposition and yeast mutation assays
Endogenous retrotransposition assays were performed
with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DG1141 (mata
trp1-hisG ura3-167 his3200 Ty1-2y2his3AI). DG1141
was transformed with pYES3/CT and its derivatives
using a standard lithium acetate heat-shock procedure.
Transformants were selected on synthetic complete
media lacking tryptophan (SC-TRP). Single colonies
were used to inoculate SC-TRP + glucose liquid cultures
and incubated at 378C. Saturated cultures were diluted
500-fold and used to inoculate 2ml SC-TRP + 3% galac-
tose, which were grown to saturation at 208C (10 days).
To determine the transposition frequency, 200 ml of each

culture was plated onto SC-HIS media and 100ml of a 105
dilution was plated onto YPAD (rich) media. The trans-
position frequency of Ty1 was calculated as the number of
HIS+ colonies divided by the number of viable cells.
Yeast-based canavanine-resistance assays for DNA
mutation were performed in a UNG-deﬁcient derivative
of the S. cerevisiae strain, L40 [MATa his3D200 trp1-901
leu2-3112 ade2 LYS2(4lexAop-HIS3) URA3(8lexAop-
lacZ) GAL4; (26)]. L40-UNG was transformed with
pYES3/CT and its derivatives and selected on SC-TRP
media. Single colonies were used to inoculate 2ml
SC-TRP + 2% galactose + 1% raﬃnose liquid cultures,
which were grown to saturation at 308C. Two hundred
microliters of each culture was plated onto SC media con-
taining 30 mg/ml of canavanine, and 100ml of a 105 dilu-
tion was plated onto YPAD (rich) media. The mutation
frequency was calculated as the number of canavanine-
resistant colonies per viable cell.
Immunoblots
HeLa and 293 cells were lyzed in 2 Laemmli buﬀer and
boiled for 5min to obtain whole-cell extracts. Proteins
were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyviny-
lidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes and probed with
anti-HA (Covance) or anti-a-tubulin (Covance)
antibodies.
Quantitative PCR analyses
Tissues were harvested from three male and two female
C57/BL6 mice and ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA
was extracted from the frozen tissue using an RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and a rotor-stator homogenizer.
RNA extracts were treated with DNase (Ambion DNA-
free Turbo DNase) and 500 ng of each RNA sample was
reverse transcribed using Transcriptor Reverse
Transcriptase (Roche) to make cDNA. cDNA samples
were further diluted in water and the cDNA equivalent
of 10 ng of RNA was used for quantitative PCR (qPCR)
in a Lightcycler 480 II (Roche). Primer-probe sets for
qPCR for each gene were designed using the Roche
Universal Probe Library (UPL) website. AID cDNA was
detected using primers 50-TCC TGC TCA CTG GAC

RESULTS
AID proteins from eight vertebrate species are functional
DNAmutators inE. coli
We hypothesized that present day AID (either mammalian
or non-mammalian) has the ability to inhibit the replica-
tion of retroelements, similar to that of the related
APOBEC3 (A3) proteins. Towards testing this hypothesis,
we acquired and (sub)cloned AID cDNAs from eight rep-
resentative vertebrate species (Figures 1A and B) and con-
ﬁrmed their ability to mutate DNA using an E. coli-based
DNA mutation assay (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Figure S2). Expression of all of the AID proteins in
E. coli increased the frequency of occurrence of
Rifampicin-resistant (RifR) E. coli colonies, ranging
from 2.2-fold (puﬀerﬁsh AID) to 12.4-fold (zebraﬁsh
AID) over the empty vector. Almost all of these proteins
have been shown to elicit activity in E. coli previously and,
as discussed in these studies, the variation in the mutation
frequencies observed here may be due to diﬀerences in
protein expression, optimal temperatures for enzymatic
activity, intrinsic enzymatic activity and/or other factors
(43,56–58). Regardless of the multiple explanations, the
most important points from these initial studies were
that all of these AID cDNAs were capable of encoding
a catalytically active protein and that they were therefore
suitable for subsequent experimentation.
AID can inhibit the transposition of the non-LTR
retrotransposon, L1
Several human A3 proteins have been shown to possess the
capacity to inhibit the transposition of L1 in cell culture-
based assays (22,23,25,31–34). L1 undergoes target-primed
reverse transcription to produce a DNA copy of its genome
within the nucleus of the host cell. Since AID is capable
of entering the nuclear compartment, we considered that
AID might also possess anti-L1 activity. We therefore
tested its activity against an L1 reporter construct in 293
cells. The L1 construct used in our studies harbors a GFP
reporter gene in the reverse orientation to the L1 genome
(59). The GFP gene contains an anti-sense intron that must
be removed by splicing of the full-length L1 transcript,
followed by reverse transcription and integration, in
order for the GFP protein to be functionally expressed.
A GFP-positive cell therefore indicates that a successful
retrotransposition event has occurred.
The 293 cells were co-transfected with AID-HA expres-
sion plasmids and the L1 reporter plasmid, and transfec-
tants were selected with puromycin (L1 plasmid). L1
retrotransposition was monitored by the appearance of
GFP-positive cells 5 days later. All of the AID proteins
tested inhibited L1 retrotransposition (the appearance of
GFP+ cells) (Figure 2A). The ability of pig AID to inhibit
L1 transposition was comparable with the positive con-
trol, human A3A [7.3-fold and 8.0-fold, respectively
(23,25,31,32)]. Human AID displayed a 3.8-fold inhibition
and, puﬀerﬁsh AID showed a 3.2-fold inhibition despite
its lower expression level (Figure 2B) and activity in E. coli
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S2). Chicken and
zebraﬁsh AIDs had the weakest activity against L1 at

1.7-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. Mouse and rat AIDs
showed intermediate levels of activity. The A3A catalytic
site mutant, (A3AE72A) was used as a negative control
(23,25,31,32). The inter-species diﬀerences may be attrib-
utable to multiple factors, including amino acid diﬀerences
(Figure 1A), but it is important to emphasize that
these results clearly demonstrated that the AID proteins
of multiple species are capable of inhibiting L1
retrotransposition.
The inhibition of L1 by AID occurs through a DNA
deamination-independent mechanism
We next asked whether L1 inhibition requires the DNA
cytosine deaminase activity of AID. The 293 cells were
transfected with the L1 reporter plasmid and plasmids
expressing HA-tagged human AID, A3A, A3G, A3B or
the equivalent catalytically inactive mutants in either 2:1,
1:1 or 1:2 ratios (L1:AID/A3). Interestingly, the anti-L1
activity of AID was not aﬀected by substituting the con-
served catalytic glutamate for glutamine (E58Q;
Figure 2C). Catalytically inert A3G and A3B mutants
also showed near wild-type inhibitory activity, as observed
previously (22,25,31). In contrast, but consistent with
prior reports, L1 inhibition by A3A was dependent upon
the catalytic glutamate (25,30–32). Protein expression
levels were similar for all of the wild-type and mutant
proteins in these cells (Figure 2D). These data demon-
strated that E58 is not required for the AID-dependent
inhibition of L1 retrotransposition and, further, that the

mechanism is most likely not through mutation of the L1
genome.
To conﬁrm and extend these studies, we tested several
mutants of human AID that were expected to disrupt
catalysis by preventing zinc coordination (C87A, C90A)
or altering the catalytic site pocket [W84A; extrapolated
from the NMR structure of the C-terminal domain of
A3G (60)]. These mutants also displayed close to wild-
type levels of activity against L1, despite being catalyti-
cally inactive in the E. coli-based DNA mutation assay
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S2). In contrast,
consistent with the requirement of the integrity of the
catalytic site of A3A for L1 restriction, mutation of W98
(equivalent to W84 in AID) to alanine completely elimi-
nated the anti-L1 activity of A3A (Figure 3). These data
indicated that AID and A3A restrict L1 replication by two
distinct mechanisms.
However, despite these diﬀerential mechanistic require-
ments, L1 inhibition by A3A (or, understandably, AID)
does not appear to be associated with hypermutations
(22,23,31,32). At present, it is diﬃcult to fully reconcile
these observations, but one explanation is the possibility
that an edited (uracilated) L1 replication intermediate
attracts DNA repair proteins that trigger its rapid
degradation.
As an additional control to rule out the possibility that
the reduction in GFP expression observed in the presence
of AID or A3A may have been due to a nonspeciﬁc eﬀect
on the L1 plasmid, we repeated the experiment with a
selected number of AID and A3 constructs, but replaced
the L1 construct with a plasmid that expresses GFP con-
stitutively (pEGFP-N3) (Supplementary Figure S3).
Although we detected a decrease of 10–20% in the
percentage of GFP-positive cells in the presence of wild-
type AID or A3A, it was clearly insuﬃcient to fully
explain the observed reduction in L1 retrotransposition.
Moreover, this eﬀect appeared dependent upon the cata-
lytic activity of both proteins. A3G did not have any eﬀect
on the percentage of GFP-positive cells.
DNA binding by AID is not required for the inhibition of
L1 transposition
Since the catalytic glutamate (E58) and the active site
tryptophan (W84) were not necessary for AID to inhibit
L1 transposition, we sought next to dissect this deamina-
tion-independent mechanism. First, we asked whether
DNA binding was required. Based on the NMR structure
of the C-terminal catalytic domain of A3G, we mutated
two conserved arginine residues in human AID that are
predicted to be required for DNA binding (R24E, R112E
and R24E/R112E) (60). The ability of these arginine
mutants to impede L1 transposition was almost identical
to that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that direct
DNA binding is not required for L1 restriction
(Figure 3A). Despite some variability in the immunoblot
results, all AID variants were expressed similarly
(Figure 3B and data not shown). As expected, these
AID mutants were inactive in the E. coli-based DNA
mutation assay (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S2).
Inhibition of L1 transposition is unaffected by the nuclear
accumulation of AID
Since L1 undergoes reverse transcription in the nucleus of
the host cell, we initially hypothesized that AID would
need to be in the nucleus to inhibit this process.
However, since mutation of the L1 DNA by AID is not
required to inhibit L1 replication, AID could be acting
either within the nucleus or within the cytoplasm, where
it is localized predominantly [(61); Figure 4D]. To address
this question, we tested a variant of AID that is
mostly nuclear because it lacks the last 10 amino acids,
which includes the nuclear export sequence (AIDC)

[(62,63); Figure 4D]. AIDC inhibited L1 to the same
extent as the wild-type protein (Figure 4).
However, we and others have noted that AID is
imported into the nucleus of 293 cells at a lower rate
compared with other cell lines (A. M. Patenaude and
J. Di Noia, personal communication). We therefore
repeated the experiment in HeLa cells. Again, we observed
that AID and AIDC inhibited L1 to similar extents
despite their clearly distinct subcellular localizations
(Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S4). This result
suggested either that the amount of AID protein required
for inhibition of L1 is not limiting in our systems (i.e. the
small amounts of protein present in the nucleus or cyto-
plasm are suﬃcient to inhibit L1) or that AID inhibits L1
soon after it is translated in the cytoplasm. We also noted
that the rate of L1 transposition and the expression of
AID are both lower in HeLa cells than in 293 cells
(Supplementary Figure S4 and unpublished data). The
reason(s) for these diﬀerences were not investigated.
Phosphorylation of AID does not affect its ability
to inhibit L1
It has been demonstrated previously that AID can be
phosphorylated at threonine (T)27 and serine (S)38 and
that these events may be important for the function of
AID (64–68). Therefore, we considered that phosphoryla-
tion could regulate the ability of AID to inhibit L1 trans-
position, and generated variants of AID with these sites
mutated to either alanine (to prevent phosphorylation) or
to glutamate (to mimic phosphorylation). Again, these
mutants inhibited L1 replication to the same extent as
the wild-type protein, indicating that phosphorylation of
AID is not required for the restriction of L1 (Figure 5).
AID cDNA and RNA are not sufficient to inhibit L1
transposition
Since all of the AID variants we tested behaved almost
identically to the wild-type protein, we considered that the
anti-L1 activity might be conferred by the AID expression
plasmid or the RNA, rather than by the protein. To
address this possibility we generated two AID expression
constructs that contained early premature termination
codons (K10X and W20X). Neither of these constructs
was able to inhibit L1 transposition, strongly indicating
the requirement for the AID protein (Supplementary
Figure S6).
AID can also inhibit the transposition ofMusD
In addition to inhibiting L1, a non-LTR retrotransposon,
A3 proteins are also capable of interfering with the repli-
cation of LTR-type endogenous retroelements, such as
MusD (16,26–28,32,35–38,69–72). We considered that
AID may possess the same activity and therefore tested
AID’s ability to inhibit MusD transposition.
Retrotransposition of a marked MusD element from a
plasmid in HeLa cells can be monitored by the appearance
of neomycin-resistant (NeoR) colonies (73). Consistent
with a previously published report, AID proteins from
multiple species had a modest, inhibitory eﬀect on the
formation of NeoR colonies, whereas human A3G
almost completely eliminated retrotransposition [(35);
Figure 6A]. Analysis of data from four independent
experiments conﬁrmed that human AID exerted a signif-
icant inhibitory eﬀect against MusD (P< 0.0001,
Student’s t-test; Supplementary Figure S5). However, we
noticed that the expression of AID was 20-fold lower
than that of A3G in HeLa cells, making a direct compar-
ison between the two proteins diﬃcult. To extend this
study and to determine whether the inhibitory eﬀect of
AID was dependent upon its catalytic activity, we

transfected varying amounts of human AID and AIDE58Q
into the cells along with the MusD-containing plasmid
and monitored retrotransposition. Again, wild-type AID
displayed weak anti-MusD activity that varied with the
amount of transfected AID plasmid (Supplementary
Figure S3A). Similar to our L1 studies, AIDE58Q inhibited
MusD to the same extent as the wild-type protein
(Figure 6C), suggesting a deamination-independent
mechanism.
AID does not significantly inhibit the transposition of
Ty1 in yeast
We considered that HeLa and 293 cells (non-B cells) may
contain an inhibitor of AID that is interfering with its
function. We therefore opted to use an extremely hetero-
logous system: transposition of a yeast LTR-retroelement,
Ty1 (26,28). Retrotransposition of the Ty1 genome results
in the removal of an intron from a HIS3 reporter gene,
conferring a HIS+ phenotype to yeast cells with a newly
retrotransposed Ty1 element. The replication of Ty1, and
therefore the formation of HIS+ colonies, was largely
unaﬀected by the presence of any of the AID proteins,
in contrast to human A3G and A3F [Figure 7A; (26,28)].
This negative result prompted us to determine whether
our AID constructs were capable of catalyzing DNA cyto-
sine to uracil deamination in yeast cells. We determined
that all of the AID proteins used increased the rate of
mutation to canavanine resistance compared with vector
(Figure 7B), indicating that they were all able to mutate
the CAN1 gene DNA, as shown previously for human
AID (74). Thus, these controls helped support the conclu-
sion that AID is not able to inhibit the transposition of
Ty1 in yeast.
AID is expressed outside of the B-cell compartment in mice
While the anti-L1 and anti-MusD activities of AID were
certainly intriguing, we were unsure how a protein that is
expressed in B lymphocytes could prevent the transposi-
tion of retroelements that replicate mostly in germ cells
and/or early in embryogenesis (although reports of
somatic mobilization of L1 are emerging) (75–78).
However, several studies have suggested that AID may
be expressed outside of the B-cell compartment in certain
circumstances (58,79–82). Therefore, since a good anti-
mouse AID antibody is not commercially available for
protein detection, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to
determine the relative levels of AID expression in various
mouse tissues. We showed that AID is expressed in the
spleen (as expected) and ovaries (60% compared with
spleen), but only weakly in heart, and not at all in liver
or testes (Figure 8A). These data were in accordance with

another study that found high levels of AID expression in
oocytes (82). Representative PCR reactions products were
also visualized on an agarose gel to verify the qPCR data
(Figure 8B). The AID amplicon was visible in the reaction
from spleen and ovary cDNA, but not from heart, liver or
testes cDNA. We conﬁrmed speciﬁc ampliﬁcation of AID
by cloning and sequencing the qPCR product. RPL13A
was used as the housekeeping gene control, and it ampli-
ﬁed similarly in all samples. We concluded that AID is
indeed expressed in a tissue relevant to L1 and MusD
replication in vivo.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we showed that AID from multiple species
could inhibit the replication of the retrotransposon L1.
We were surprised to ﬁnd that many highly conserved
residues of human AID were dispensable for L1 restric-
tion, including the catalytic glutamate E58, the zinc-coor-
dinating cysteines C87 and C90, the active site tryptophan
W84 and the single-strand DNA binding arginines R24
and R112. These data combined to demonstrate a DNA
deamination-independent mechanism. Similar DNA
editing-independent L1 restriction mechanisms have also
been documented for human A3B and A3G, but the repli-
cative stage of the block has yet to be determined
(22,23,25,31,33,34). In contrast, restriction of L1 by
human A3A clearly has a diﬀerent set of genetic require-
ments dependent upon the analogous, conserved catalytic
glutamate, zinc-coordinating cysteines and active site tryp-
tophan [(25,32) and this study]. Thus, at least two distinct

mechanisms may serve to limit the transposition of L1 and
similar non-LTR type retroelements in vertebrates.
Additional studies will be required to pinpoint the step
(or steps) at which AID/A3 proteins interfere with L1
replication.
Although the restriction of many retrotransposon and
retrovirus substrates by multiple A3 proteins is clearly
associated with G-to-A hypermutations in the coding
DNA strand, a growing number of studies have indicated
deamination-independent mechanisms (14,15). Several
prior studies showed that L1 restriction was not associated
with A3 protein subcellular localization, as A3F (cyto-
plasmic) and A3B (nuclear) each inhibited L1 replication
with similar eﬃciencies (22,23,25,32). Our studies with
AID (predominantly cytoplasmic) and AIDC (mostly
nuclear) also indicated that sub-cellular compartmentali-
zation is not a rate-limiting step in L1 restriction. Thus, we
favor an L1 restriction model in which cytoplasmic AID
(A3B, A3F or A3G) engages assembling L1 replication
complexes co- or post-translationally (Supplementary
Figure S7). This cytoplasmic restriction model is sup-
ported indirectly by data showing that at least one family
member, A3G, forms high-molecular mass cytoplasmic
complexes, and that this complex is required for restriction
of the L1-dependent retroelement Alu (24,83–85). AID
also appears capable of forming large cytoplasmic com-
plexes (1,2,86), and it is possible that at least some of the
complex components are shared with A3G. A cytoplasmic
restriction model is also appealing because it is the ﬁrst to
suggest a function for AID in the subcellular compartment
in which it is predominantly located.
It is notable that G-to-A hypermutations have not been
associated with L1 restriction by AID, A3B, A3F, A3G
or even A3A, which requires key catalytic residues
[(22,23,25,31–34) and this study]. As mentioned above, a
part of this apparent failure (at least for A3A) may be due
to rapid degradation of edited L1’s by cellular DNA repair
enzymes. However, a reasonable alternative explanation
is the possibility that editing may be co-factor or post-
translational modiﬁcation dependent. For instance, like

Figure 7. Eﬀect of AID on Ty1 retrotransposition. (A) The transposi-
tion frequency of Ty1 in yeast cells expressing the indicated untagged
AID or A3 (A3F, A3G) proteins or empty vector. The transposition
frequency was calculated as the number of HIS+ colonies per viable
cell. The vector control was normalized to 1 for each experiment.
Histogram bars represent the mean of the medians from four indepen-
dent experiments (actual mean for vector=2.8  106) and error bars
represent the standard deviation. (B) Yeast-based CANR assay for
DNA mutation. Each ‘x’ represents the mutation frequency of an inde-
pendent culture, calculated as the number of CANR colonies per viable
cell. Six independent cultures were assayed for each AID variant, and
the median mutation frequencies are indicated by the horizontal bars.
Vector represents the background level of mutation in UNG-deﬁcient
yeast.

the RNA editing family member APOBEC1, C-to-U dea-
mination of its physiological substrate APOB mRNA is
thought to require a co-factor called ACF. It is therefore
plausible that AID (and also APOBEC3s) employ tissue-
speciﬁc co-factors and/or post-translational modiﬁcations
for maximal editing and/or restriction eﬃciency. AID may
very well use distinct co-factors or modiﬁcations in germi-
nal center B cells to edit antibody gene DNA than those
that it may use in other tissues to inhibit L1 replication
(such as the ovary). For instance, cofactors have recently
been implicated for AID in antibody diversiﬁcation and
for A3G-dependent restriction of HIV-1 (87,88).
We also conﬁrmed a previous report that AID mRNA
is expressed in ovarian tissue (82), at least in mice, placing
AID in a compartment where replication of L1 may have
the greatest impact in vivo (75–77). Although AID expres-
sion has also been detected in human testes (81), we did
not ﬁnd it in mouse testes tissue; species-speciﬁc diﬀer-
ences, sterile housing conditions and/or other factors
may be responsible. Nevertheless, expression data
[(80–82,89) and this study], L1 restriction data (this
study) and phylogenetic evidence that an AID-like ances-
tor duplicated and diverged to give rise to the present day
A3s (41–44) combine to indicate that AID may indeed also
function in providing innate immunity to retroelements [as
originally proposed in (45); see also (90)]. Future studies
will be directed toward testing this hypothesis in vivo, in
mice or ﬁsh or an organism where both precise genetics
and quantitative transposition assays are possible.
Endogenous retrotransposons make up a large portion
of the mammalian genome, with L1 elements alone con-
stituting around 20% of the human and mouse genomes
(91,92). With approximately 100 active copies in humans
and around 3000 active copies in mice (93–95), it is likely
that cellular factors are required to maintain a balance
between new insertions contributing to beneﬁcial genetic
diversity and causing deleterious gene disruptions. The
APOBEC3 proteins are almost certainly one class of
innate restriction factors. It is probable that A3 genes
evolved from their more ancient family member, AID,
and ﬁne-tuned the anti-retroelement activity during this
process. In contrast to many of the APOBEC3s, which
appear to have undergone a strong diversifying selection
(41,43,96,97), AID appears to be under purifying selection
(41), which probably reﬂects the essential nature of AID’s
function in antibody diversiﬁcation. The A3s may have
therefore emerged to enable mammals to ‘keep up’ with
the retroviruses and retrotransposons due to AID’s func-
tional constraints.
