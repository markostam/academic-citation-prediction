Pseudocalanus species are important contributors to the secondary production of the northern
hemisphere mid- to high-latitude oceans. In the coastal Gulf of Alaska, Pseudocalanus are present
year round and are represented by three species. In 2001, Pseudocalanus mimus was the dominant
Pseudocalanus species on the shelf during spring and summer, comprising 30–100% of the total,
while Pseudocalanus newmani dominated in Prince William Sound (10–90%). Pseudocalanus
minutus were only abundant in Prince William Sound during early spring. Egg production (by
number and volume) was a function of female prosome length and decreased from spring to summer;
however, significant variability was attributable to regional influences that were independent of size.
For the same sized female, P. newmani produced more eggs per clutch than P. mimus. Pseudo-
calanus mimus, however, tended to have a larger mean egg size than P. newmani. Consequently,
clutch volumes of the two species were indistinguishable. Pseudocalanus egg production rates
(EPRs) (eggs female–1 day1) were lower in July and August (ca. 2–4) than April and May
(ca. 1–9), but total egg production by the population (eggs day1) was nearly equivalent for the
two time periods due to higher female concentrations in summer.
INTRODUCTION
The copepod genus Pseudocalanus is common in tempe-
rate and boreal pelagic ecosystems and is thought to play
an important role in the trophic ecology of these systems
due to its high rate of production relative to larger
crustacean zooplankton (Corkett and McLaren, 1978).
Researchers once published results for a complex of
copepods (often called Pseudocalanus spp. or Pseudocalanus
elongatus); a relatively recent revision of the genus now
recognizes seven species (Frost, 1989). This has facili-
tated species-specific studies of the genus that examine
differences in life history of sympatric species (McLaren
et al., 1989a; Bucklin et al., 2001).
The coastal Gulf of Alaska (northern North Pacific
Ocean) is a biologically productive ecosystem that
appears to be driven by downwelling (Weingartner
et al., 2002; Stabeno et al., 2004). It contains many
harvested and protected living resources. In this region,
Pseudocalanus is generally the second most numerically
abundant genus (behind Oithona) among the crustacean
zooplankton (Cooney, 1986; Incze et al., 1997; Coyle and
Pinchuk, 2003), yet only a single report has documented
species proportions (Siefert, 1994). Within this system and
the adjacent Bering Sea, Pseudocalanus spp. are estimated to
be among the top secondary producers (Coyle and
Pinchuk, 2002) and are important prey items for both
larval and juvenile fish (Kendall and Nakatani, 1991;
Hilgruber et al., 1995; Napp et al., 1996; Schabetsberger
et al., 2003).
Female Pseudocalanus spp. are clutch spawners, laying
their eggs into a single egg sac that is carried by the
female until hatching. Egg production rates (EPRs) are a
function of the clutch size, the embryonic duration and
the interclutch period (Corkett and McLaren, 1978).
Egg production is thought to be independent of food
concentration above ca. 100 mg C L1 (Corkett and
McLaren, 1978) or 2 mg Chl m3 (Bunker and Hirst,
2004). Temperature has a strong influence on EPR by
modulating clutch size (through female size) and
embryonic duration (Lee et al., 2003). Species-specific

EPRs are only now appearing in the literature (Ban et al.,
2000; Lee et al., 2003), but there are few comparisons
among sympatric species.
The present study combines initial results of two
research groups’ efforts to understand secondary pro-
duction in the coastal Gulf of Alaska as part of the
North East Pacific GLOBal Ocean ECosystems
Dynamics Program (NEP GLOBEC; Weingartner et al.,
2002). We ask here, what are the temporal and spatial
patterns of female Pseudocalanus species distribution in the
Gulf of Alaska, and how does female length, clutch size
and egg production vary between the species during a
year?
METHOD
Samples were collected, and experiments conducted
aboard the R/V Alpha Helix during the GLOBEC Process
and Long-Term Observation Program (LTOP) cruises in
2001. Process cruises were in April, May and late July/
early August, while LTOP cruises occurred in April, May,
July, August and October. Investigations were generally
conducted in three regions of the shelf (inner, middle and
outer) and in Prince William Sound, a large, deep fjord
(Fig. 1). The geographic location of stations varied among
Process cruises, but not LTOP cruises (GAK Stations 1, 4,
9, 13 on the Seward Line and PWS2). The inner shelf
station was typically within the Alaska Coastal Current
during both types of cruises. Concurrent environmental
sampling was accomplished with a SeaBird 911Plus CTD.
Preserved samples from the first year of LTOP cruises
(1998) were also used to examine cross shelf patterns in
species distributions. Their method of collection was iden-
tical to the protocol given below.

zooplankton were collected with a 25-cm diameter mouth

between 145 and 152 W. Measurements were taken along the Seward Line (GAK Stations) and in Prince William Sound. The Alaska Coastal
Current was always over the inner shelf (between GAK 1 and 3). The term ‘middle shelf’ refers to the area between GAK 4 and GAK 6, and the
‘outer shelf’ was seaward of GAK 9. Station in Prince William Sound was PWS2.

CalCOFI vertical egg tow (CalVET) frame (Smith et al.,
1985) or a QuadNet (four, 25-cm rings welded together in
a square frame). Both CalVET nets had 150-mmmesh and
the catch from the two nets was combined. The QuadNet
had two 150- and two 53-mm mesh nets (on opposing cor-
ners), and the catches from identical mesh sizes were com-
bined (only the 150-mm data are presented here, samples
from the 53-mmmesh nets were used to capture copepodite
stages of smaller copepods such as Oithona and copepod
nauplii). Tows of both frames were vertical, from 100 m to
the surface. Flow meters in each net mouth were used to
estimate filtered volume. All samples were preserved in 5%
buffered formalin seawater. Samples from the LTOP cruises
were enumerated in Fairbanks, Alaska. Samples from the
Process cruises were sorted and enumerated at the Polish
Plankton Sorting and Identification Center, Szczecin,
Poland. In both cases, Pseudocalanus copepodites were only
identified to the generic level. Species identifications for
Pseudocalanus females were accomplished in Seattle and Fair-
banks by the authors (C. Baier and C. Clarke).
Egg production studies
Females for egg production studies were captured using
comparable techniques: Process cruises used a 0.8-m
diameter ring net (150- or 200-mm mesh) while the
LTOP cruises used a 0.5-m diameter net with 200-mm
mesh net. In both cases, nets were equipped with large
volume cod ends and slowly hauled vertically through
the upper water column. Sorting was usually completed
within 1, or at most, 2 h of capture for the Process
cruises and within 2–3 h for LTOP. Non-egg sac bearing
Pseudocalanus females were transferred with a wide bore
pipette to the incubation chambers (20-ml plastic vials,
Process; 70-ml polystyrene tissue culture flask, LTOP)
filled with prescreened water from the mixed layer
(35-mm screened surface water, Process; 100-mm
screened subsurface water, LTOP). All incubations
were accomplished within 1–2C of the mixed layer
temperature.
Process cruises incubated 30–50 females per experi-
ment in the dark for 24 h at the mixed layer tempera-
ture; a new experiment was initiated each day for three
successive days while at the same station. The first two
Process cruises incubated up to four females per con-
tainer; however, species-specific EPRs were only calcu-
lated when each and every clutch from an experiment
could be attributed to a species. Clutch size–length rela-
tionships were only recorded for females with attached
egg sacs. The third Process cruise used one female per
container. All females were preserved at the end of the
experiment by adding formalin to the vial. LTOP cruises
incubated 60–80 females under natural lighting cycles at
mixed layer temperatures for 3 days. LTOP experiments
incubated a single female per flask. Females were
checked every 24 h; females producing egg sacs before
the conclusion of the experiment were removed and
individually preserved. All non-producing females were
preserved together at the conclusion of each LTOP
experiment.
In the laboratory, females were identified to species
(Frost, 1989) and measured for prosome length. The
number and size of eggs in a clutch were also deter-
mined, with either an ocular micrometer (Process) or a
computer-assisted measuring system (LTOP; Roff and
Hopcroft, 1986). The operational measurement resolu-
tion was 6 mm for the ocular micrometer measurements
of eggs, 36 mm for female prosome length and 5 mm
(eggs and prosome length) for the computer-assisted
method. EPR was calculated as (mean observed clutch
size)  (fraction of females extruding a clutch)/the incu-
bation time in days (1 day for Process and 2 or 3 days for
LTOP; Runge and Roff, 2000).
Statistical analyses
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to detect
significant differences among sources of variation (e.g.
laboratories, regions or months) in the relationship
between prosome length and clutch size. A natural loga-
rithm transformation of prosome lengths was necessary to
stabilize the variance. Linear regressions were accom-
plished with Systat v. 10.2. Descriptive statistics for the
concentration of Pseudocalanus females were calculated
after applying the 4th root transformation to the raw data.
RESULTS
Distribution of species
Initial investigation of species distribution on the north-
ern Gulf of Alaska shelf in 1998 demonstrated that
P. mimus females dominated the catches during late win-
ter to early autumn (Fig. 2). Pseudocalanus newmani was
present on almost all occasions and was most prevalent
in the spring samples (March–May). Pseudocalanus minutus
was rarely observed. There did not appear to be a cross-
shelf trend in the relative occurrence of the three species
(Fig. 2); females were most abundant in the summer and
autumn samples (not shown).
In 2001, when both the GLOBEC Process and LTOP
program components were in the field, we observed a
similar pattern to that observed in 1998 using the species
composition of females obtained for egg production
experiments (Fig. 3). In April, May, July and August,
P. mimus dominated the shelf stations, with the exception

of the LTOP collections in the inner shelf (May and
August). Pseudocalanus newmani females dominated collec-
tions in Prince William Sound and were sometimes a
significant fraction of the total number of females in the
coastal region. Pseudocalanus minutus occurred more fre-
quently in our 2001 collections than in 1998 and was
most prevalent during spring in Prince William Sound,
which was not sampled in 1998.
Seasonal trends in female length
Female prosome lengths exhibited a distinct seasonal
signal (Fig. 4) with the largest individuals of both species
being found from late April through May. There was an
increase in the median prosome length of animals col-
lected on the Seward Line between the April LTOP and
Process cruises, and a subsequent decrease in length
between the July LTOP and Process cruises. The mean
(lower 95%CI/upper 95%CI) prosome length for
P. newmani decreased from 0.975 (0.965/0.985) to
0.794 (0.788/0.801) mm, while the mean length of
P. mimus decreased from 1.127 (1.119/1.134) to 1.001
(0.993/1.009) mm. The prosome length of female
P. mimus in April was the most variable with both very
small and very large individuals present.
Species-specific egg production
The number of eggs per clutch increased as a function of
female prosome length (Fig. 5A and B), and for the same
sized female, P. newmani tended to lay more eggs per clutch
than P. mimus. There were no significant differences
between the Process and LTOP data sets for clutch size
as a function of female length for the two species
(ANCOVA; P. newmani, P > 0.68; P. mimus, P > 0.64).
There was a difference in the mean egg diameter for the
two species. Pseudocalanus mimus tended to have slightly
larger eggs (mean diameter  SE; 121.0  1.0 mm) than
P. newmani (112.0  0.7 mm) for the same size female
(Fig. 5C). Egg diameter was not a function of clutch size

Observation Program (LTOP) (K. Coyle, University of Alaska, Fair-
banks, unpublished). Samples were obtained at GAK Stations 1 and 2
(inner shelf), 6 (middle shelf) and 9 (outer shelf).

(Fig. 5D). Clutch volume (number of eggs average egg
volume) for the two species was nearly equivalent and a
function of female length (not shown).
Predicting clutch size from female length
The statistics of predicting clutch size from female length
were complicated for our data. The ANCOVA model
included terms for female prosome length, month, region,
data source (LTOP or Process), duration (LTOP data
only), their interaction terms and the residual variance.
The duration term (LTOP data only; see Methods) was
not significant for P. newmani (P = 0.724), but P. mimus had
a significant duration  month interaction term (P =
0.048). Further use of the LTOP data for P. mimus com-
bined data from the first and third durations as they could
not be distinguished from one another (a posteriori test).
For both species, prediction of clutch size from female
length was complicated by several significant interactions
between variables [P. newmani, month region (P = 0.001)
and lengthmonth (P = 0.002); P. mimus, month source
(P = 0.006) and month region (P = 0.015)]. To take into
account each and every complicating factor would have
resulted in a large number of regression equations with very
low sample sizes for each.We chose instead to pool the data
and examine predictions based on month (the strongest
effect; Table I). When we did this, 8 of 10 linear relation-
ships by month (4 for each species) had slopes that were
significantly greater than zero. For P. newmani, clutch size
increased with prosome length for all months except July.
The increase was greatest in April when themean prosome
length of females increased between the first and second
cruises (Fig. 4). Clutch size as a function of prosome length
for P. mimus also increased for all months except July. The
greatest increase was in May, not April as observed for
P. newmani. (Table I).
Overall, when the data from all months were
combined, there was a strong trend in clutch size as a
function of female prosome length for each species
(P < 0.001). There was also a high degree of variability
(Fig. 6) associated with each regression, and this pro-
duced low amounts of explained variance for each rela-
tionship (P. newmani, R2 = 0.595; P. mimus, R2 = 0.347).
Temporal trends in egg production and egg
production rate
During 2001, Pseudocalanus spp. females were most abun-
dant in Prince William Sound and on the inner shelf
(Alaska Coastal Current), and their concentration
increased during the year until August when the highest
concentration of females was observed over the inner
shelf (Fig. 7). Mean individual EPRs varied over the
course of our sampling (Fig. 8). Initial rates (April) were
quite variable among regions. EPR was high in May for
both species (>8 eggs female1 day1) in one or more
regions. Pseudocalanus newmani had high rates of egg pro-
duction in Prince William Sound (late April through late
May) and P. mimus had its highest rate over the middle
shelf (GAK 4) in early May. By July, the EPR had
dropped for both species; both species had their lowest
rates in Prince William Sound and their highest rates on
the middle shelf. In August and October, the EPR for
both species was moderate (2–4 eggs female1 day1)
and less variable among habitats than in July.
Patterns of population egg production were different
for the two species (Fig. 8). Pseudocalanus newmani had
more or less constant production in Prince William
Sound from late April to August, except for the large
increase in early May. Total production over the inner

gram (LTOP) data (first set of each pair) were collected in the first half

July, the LTOP data were collected in early to mid-July and the

shelf was without the large spike seen in Prince William
Sound. Pseudocalanus mimus on the other hand appeared
to have increasing production over the inner and middle
shelf from early May through August. Both species had
low production in October, although the values were
higher in October than in early April.
DISCU SSION
Pseudocalanus spp. play a key role in the trophic ecology of
northern temperate and subarctic waters (Corkett and
McLaren, 1978).Their estimatedproduction inother coastal
ecosystems, for exampleGeorgesBank, is oftenmuchgreater
than that of larger copepods such as Calanus (Davis, 1984a).
In the Gulf of Alaska, average annual production of Pseudo-
calanus spp. was estimated to be >700 mg C m2 year1 (or
>70mgCm3 year1 over the upper 100m).This wasmore
than seven times greater thanCalanus spp., but comparable to
the combined production ofNeocalanus plumchrus andNeocala-
nus flemingeri (Coyle and Pinchuk, 2003).
Secondary production by Pseudocalanus spp. is thought
to be controlled more by temperature than by
food (McLaren, 1978; Davis, 1984b; Frost, 1985; Klein
Breteler et al., 1995; Hirst and Lampitt, 1998; Hirst and
Bunker, 2003), thus their populations may respond
directly to interannual and decadal variability in water
temperature making them a good species for study of the
direct consequences of global climate change (Coyle and
Pinchuk, 2002; Mo¨llmann et al., 2003). In late winter
and spring, their egg production is important for

establishing prey levels of recently spawned fish larvae
such as walleye pollock (Kendall and Nakatani, 1991;
Napp et al., 1996) and Atlantic cod (Lynch et al., 2001;
Hinrichsen et al., 2002). Due to improvements in the
taxonomy of the genus (Frost, 1989), as well as the
introduction of molecular techniques (Se´vigny et al.,
1989; Bucklin et al., 2001), scientists are now able to
address species-specific ecological and life history
problems of this genus (McLaren et al., 1989a,b;
Yamaguchi et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2003).
In the Northeast Pacific, Gulf of Alaska GLOBEC
program, rate measurement of processes, including
Pseudocalanus egg production, were conducted on both
LTOP and Process cruises. Due to limited availability of
ships, both programs used the same vessel, but at different
times. This provided better temporal coverage
during spring and summer than would have been achieved
if the programs had simultaneously sampled. Our com-
bined studies used similar, but slightly different techniques,
coming to the same conclusions. For example, although
species distributions were described from animals sorted
for experimental work rather than direct net tows, the
results were very similar. This is remarkable given that
the live sorting as well as final identifications were accom-
plished by different persons. Similarly, female size distribu-
tions and EPRs were very similar, despite the different
experimental protocols (e.g. duration of the incubations).
Distribution of species
Frost (Frost, 1989) describes the coastal northern
Gulf of Alaska as having three Pseudocalanus species present:
P. mimus (temperate), P. minutus (arctic) and P. newmani
(temperate). In 2001, we found the distribution of species
to be similar to other regions of the Pacific coast of North
America (off Oregon and Washington) where P. mimus
tends to dominate the coastal current (Landry et al., 1991;
Keister and Peterson, 2003; Morgan et al., 2003). Similarly,
P. newmani was found in Prince William Sound year round,
similar to its occurrence in Puget Sound ( Jonasdottir, 1989).
Pseudocalanus newmani is also important in Funka Bay, Japan
(Ban et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2003), another walleye pollock
nursery area (Kendall and Nakatani, 1991). Individual
species of Pseudocalanus may show geographical differences
in life history traits (McLaren et al., 1989a). For example,
numbers of P. newmani diminish in Bedford Basin during
the warm water season (>10C), while those in Prince
William Sound appear to increase and maintain their
dominance during the warm water season (maximum ca.
15C). In Toyama Bay, Japan, the period of active growth
and reproduction by P. newmani is restricted to February,
March and April when the surface waters are 10–12C.
They begin to disappear from the Bay after the surface
waters become >14C (Yamaguchi et al., 1998).
Pseudocalanus moultani, a temperate species, was present
in one offshore Gulf of Alaska sample (Frost, 1989), but

was not observed in this study. In Washington state,
P. moultani occurs during winter and early spring in
Puget Sound. Its absence from Prince William Sound is
noteworthy.
In 2001, P. minutus was abundant in early spring, but
soon disappeared from the samples. We suspect that the
timing of its disappearance varies among years, as a
subsequent year (2003) shows higher abundances into
late April/early May (Hopcroft and Clarke, unpublished
data; Napp and Baier, unpublished data). It may sink
from the surface waters of Prince William Sound as a
CV copepodite to overwinter in the deep holes (Cooney
et al., 2001; Hopcroft, unpublished data) as in Toyama
Bay, Japan (Yamaguchi et al., 1998), and Bedford Basin
(McLaren et al., 1989a). Pseudocalanus minutus represents
one of several relict arctic species found within Prince
William Sound (Coyle and Pinchuk, in press).
Seasonal trends in female length
A seasonal decrease in adult Pseudocalanus spp. size conco-
mitant with increasing temperatures and decreasing food
concentrations is commonly observed [Yamaguchi et al.,
1998 (and references therein); Ban et al., 2000; Halsband
and Hirche, 2001; Lee et al., 2003]. In our study, female
size peaked in spring and then decreased with increasing
temperature. Gulf of Alaska surface water temperature
increased from about 5C to nearly 15C during the
course of our investigations. Animals at the end of summer
were approximately 15–23% shorter in length compared
to those in the spring. In the laboratory, growth of
P. newmani incubated at different temperatures began to
diverge at the second copepodite stage (C2; Lee et al.,
2003). In that study, the reduction of mean female total
length between 6 and 15Cwas 15% (from 1.3 to 1.1 mm),
consistent with our observations.
April length frequency distributions for P. mimus had
long tails or a second mode at the smaller sizes. This was
also observed for P. newmani from Shelikof Strait, Alaska
(Siefert, 1994). It is not clear whether the smaller indivi-
duals represent a different generation or animals from a
different source. Application of cohort analysis in these
regions may thus be difficult given the complicated
hydrography of the Gulf of Alaska.
Species-specific egg production
Despite the colder temperatures observed in the Gulf of
Alaska, the EPRs for P. newmani and P. mimus were
similar and comparable to the mean (ca. 4 eggs
female1day1) reported for these species in other
locales (Table II). Our maxima for P. newmani and
P. mimus (9.3 and 8.1 eggs female1 day1, respectively),
however, tended to be slightly higher than that observed
in other regions of the North Pacific Ocean. A recent
compilation of EPRs (Bunker and Hirst, 2004) suggested
that saturated EPR for Pseudocalanus, standardized to
15C is 7.8 eggs female1 day1. Scaling this published
statistical result to 5C (using a Q10 of 2) predicts an
EPR of 4 eggs female1 day1 which is similar to the
mean from other locations (Table II), but seriously
underestimates the maximum rates observed in this

study at that temperature. We hypothesize that the cool
temperatures and sustained production of large phyto-
plankton cells (in the Alaska Coastal Current and Prince
William Sound) create favorable conditions for high
reproductive output by Pseudocalanus (i.e. large females
and food-replete waters).
The two species, P. newmani and P. mimus, have different
reproductive strategies. For the same sized individuals,
P. newmani has larger clutches than P. mimus, but P. mimus
has larger eggs. Our egg diameter measurements were
almost identical to those reported by Frost (Frost, 1989).
The relative advantages of these strategies warrant future
study particularly when the species co-occur. Recent
studies demonstrate variable hatching success and a high
proportion of births with presumably debilitating defor-
mities associated with some diatom blooms (Ban et al.,
2000; Halsband-Lenk et al., personal communication).
Molecular markers will be useful to determine the relative
survival/reproductive success of each of these species that
co-occur in open coastal and fjord environments.
Predicting clutch size from female length
Within the Calanoida there exist relationships between
brood volume and body volume, and egg diameter and
prosome length for egg sac spawners (Mauchline, 1998). As
in other studies of the genus Pseudocalanus, clutch size was a
function of female size (prosome length, Corkett and
McLaren, 1978). We did not, however, observe a relation-
ship between egg diameter and prosome length over the
short length interval measured during this study. Our sta-
tistical analyses suggest that length was not the only variable
that contributed to clutch size. ANCOVA detected sign-
ificant effects of the underlying seasonal cycle (i.e. month)
and the location of the experimental animals (i.e. region)
that were independent of variations in size. While general
univariate regression equations can be used to predict
clutch size over all regions, the most accurate equations
for the coastal Gulf of Alaska would be ones uniquely
developed for each region. Ideally one would construct a
predictive equation for each combination species, month
and region. Unfortunately, in this current study, sample
size was insufficient to derive useful predictive equations for
each region and month. Thus, for pragmatic reasons we
chose to construct simple, univariate predictive equations
by species and month and ignored the other sources of
variability identified by the ANCOVA.
In other areas of the North Pacific Ocean, predictions of
Pseudocalanus clutch size from length have been accom-
plished (Table II). Examples of studies of P. newmani out-
number those of P. mimus at this point in time. There is a
large range in the amount of explained variance (R2) for
the various predictive relationships (0.03–0.90). The study
with the highest amount of explained variance (Ban et al.,
2000) used averages from seven different experiments
where both clutch size and female prosome length were
allowed to vary. The lower explained variance in the
present study is due, in part, to inclusion of data from the
summer months when the population was dominated by
small females with low individual reproductive output.
Temporal trends in egg production and egg
production rate
Pseudocalanus species in theGulf of Alaska increase in relative
abundance as the summer progresses and Neocalanus species
enter diapause (Incze et al., 1997; Cooney et al., 2001; Coyle
and Pinchuk, 2003; Coyle and Pinchuk, in press). Due to
their relatively high production rates compared with other
late summermembers of themesozooplankton community,
Pseudocalanus spp. are likely an important conduit of primary
and secondary production to upper trophic levels. Large
seasonal increases in the number of females in some areas of
our study more than compensated for the smaller clutch
sizes produced by the smaller summer females (mean clutch
size was reduced by about 50–75%). Thus, total population
of EPRs were approximately comparable between the early
spring and late summer for P. newmani and increased from
late April to August for P. mimus.
Increasing population size, in our study, suggests that
rates of mortality did not keep pace with increases in
reproduction as the season progressed. In addition to our
increasing knowledge regarding the importance of pre-
dation (Ohman, 1985; Bollens, 1988; Eiane and
Ohman, 2004), egg viability, hatching success and nau-
pliar survival rates as a function of diet are just now
being recognized as potentially important variables mod-
ifying recruitment in Pseudocalanus (Ban et al., 2000;
Halsband-Lenk et al., personal communication). It
would be interesting to explore whether species-specific
differences are manifested in these variables, and
whether they bear any relationship to the differences in
the reproductive strategies (clutch size and EPR)
observed between P. mimus and P. newmani in this study
and in other regions.
