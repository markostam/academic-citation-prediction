ABSTRACT
Several bioinformatics studies have identified an
unexpected but remarkably prevalent 10 bp peri-
odicity of AA/TT dinucleotides (hyperperiodicity) in
certain regions of the Caenorhabditis elegans gen-
ome. Although the relevant C.elegans DNA seg-
ments share certain sequence characteristics with
bent DNAs from other sources (e.g. trypanosome
mitochondria), the nematode sequences exhibit a
much more extensive and defined hyperperiodicity.
Given the presence of hyperperiodic structures in a
number of critical C.elegans genes, the physical
characteristics of hyperperiodic DNA are of consid-
erable interest. In this work, we demonstrate that
several hyperperiodic DNA segments from
C.elegans exhibit structural anomalies using high-
resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) and gel
electrophoresis. Our quantitative analysis of AFM
images reveals that hyperperiodic DNA adopts a
significantly smaller mean square end-to-end dis-
tance, hence a more compact coil structure, com-
pared with non-periodic DNA of similar length. While
molecules remain capable of adopting both bent
and straight (rod-like) configurations, indicating that
their flexibility is still retained, examination of the
local curvatures along the DNA contour length
reveals that the decreased mean square end-to-end
distance can be attributed to the presence of long-
scale intrinsic bending in hyperperiodic DNA. Such
bending is not detected in non-periodic DNA.
Similar studies of shorter, nucleosome-length
DNAs that survived micrococcal nuclease digestion
show that sequence hyperperiodicity in short seg-
ments can likewise induce strong intrinsic bending.
It appears, therefore, that regions of the C.elegans
genome display a significant correlation between
DNA sequence and unusual mechanical properties.
INTRODUCTION
DNA structures are frequently modeled as flexible, isotropic
rods both in solution and in their ability to contribute to
native biological structures such as chromatin (1). Despite
the utility of such models, it has been clear for some time
that the sequence of a DNA molecule can contribute very
specifically to its 3D structure, both in vitro (2,3) and
in vivo (4). Particularly striking in their non-linear structure,
certain sequences can introduce a stereo-specific bend in
DNA. The most prominent sequence contributing to these
structural anomalies are strings of three, four or more consec-
utive A or T residues (A-tracts) (5,6), although other nucleot-
ide segments can also induce structural anomalies (7). A-tract
bending has been investigated using X-ray crystallography,
gel electrophoresis, electric birefringence, circular dichroism
and NMR [for reviews see (8,9)]. DNA curvature of
non-genomic DNA has also been investigated with
electron microscopy (10,11) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) (12–14).
Many of the unusual DNA sequences that have been the
subject of biophysical and modeling studies have involved
relatively short (10–80 bases) bent regions either examined
in isolation (15) or examined in the context of a longer frag-
ment (13). This type of DNA structure is common in many
genome sequences and in numerous cases has been associated
with biological function, either in facilitating a specific
protein interaction at the site of the bend as in the case of nuc-
leosomes (16) or in facilitating a long-range interaction of
two sites in the genome that otherwise might not be capable
of interacting (17).
Recently, it has become clear that certain eukaryotic gen-
omes include sequences with a more extended anomalous
character in which groups of An/Tn residues are present in
a periodic and highly non-random manner over a range of

several hundred nucleotides (18,19). In the Caenorhabditis
elegans genome, a remarkable periodicity of 10 bp
AA/TT dinucleotides has been described elsewhere (20–24).
One proposed role for such sequences has been to limit the
capability of nucleosomes to slide into the kind of ordered
arrays needed for heterochromatin formation (19). Although
such long DNAs can be readily modeled using the extensive
data available for shorter bent segments, it is by no means
clear that such models continue to provide an accurate
approximation as the length of the Periodic An/Tn Cluster
(PATC) increases. At extremes of possibility, it could
be imagined that such DNAs would form complex coils
and knots in solution or, alternatively, might behave as relat-
ively straight segments perhaps with unusual microscopic
flexibility properties.
In order to understand the genesis and role for extended
PATCs in eukaryotic genomes, we first need to define their
physical properties. Genomes for C.elegans and other nemat-
ode species have been shown to exhibit an unusual high fre-
quency of extended PATCs (20,23,24), particularly in regions
of the genome that are transcribed in germline tissues. The
C.elegans genome has the additional advantage that it is
among the most extensively characterized both in structure
and function, since the sequence is known and individual
genetic studies, genome expression and phenotype analysis
have been done.
In this work, we have used gel electrophoresis and AFM to
carry out an extensive analysis of several extended PATCs
from the genome of the nematode C.elegans. We find that
the hyperperiodic DNA shows a significant and readily
discernible degree of bending compared with non-periodic
DNAs, adopting correlated angles over long distances, and
that increased flexibility alone cannot explain the mechanical
properties of this DNA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
AFM constructs
For AFM imaging, we fabricated a pseudo-palindrome
construct of 2885 bp using a method similar to that described
in Ref. (14). This construct contained two segments of 923 bp
of hyperperiodic W4 fragments from C.elegans in an inverse
orientation each located at the ends of the construct (for
description of the fragments of C.elegans used, see Results).
We refer to this construct as the periodic palindrome con-
struct (PPC). Our AFM analysis focused on the first 953 bp
at both ends, which included the hyperperiodic sequences.
We analyzed a fragment of DNA slightly longer than the
pure hyperperiodic fragment because the very ends were
not considered in the analysis. The extra non-periodic 979
bp, located in the middle part of the construct, was chosen
to be non-palindromic, although it was also part of the
C.elegans genome. In doing so, we avoided the synthesis of
a real palindromic construct, which could generate two inde-
pendent double-stranded DNA molecules of length equal to
half of the original one. The scheme of the PPC, including
the sequence of one of the hyperperiodic DNA fragments
(capital letters), is shown in Figure 1a. PPC fabrication and
long-term stability was verified using gel electrophoresis.
We also analyzed two short DNAs, which contained frag-
ments W6 and W7 (for description of these fragments see Res-
ults). Fragments W7 and W6 were amplified by cloning into
the pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Promega), yielding two short
DNAs (SQ100 and SQ322) that were analyzed with gel elec-
trophoresis and AFM. SQ100 (185 bp) contained the
non-periodic fragment W7 (Figure 1b) and SQ322 (182 bp)
contained the hyperperiodic fragment W6 (Figure 1c). Capital
letters in Figure 1b and c denote the W7 and W6 sequence
components. Sequences are specified excluding the single-
stranded overhangs.
All sequences in Figure 1 are displayed in a 10 bp arrange-
ment to facilitate visualization of same-residue coincidence
every helical turn. To assist this, two or more consecutive
Ts are colored in red and two or more consecutive As in
green. The sequences in Figure 1a and c, corresponding to
the hyperperiodic fragment in the PPC and the SQ322 con-
struct fragment, respectively, demonstrate a propensity for
an AA/TT to be present every 10 bp. In contrast, the degree
of periodicity in SQ100 (Figure 1b) is negligible.
Gel electrophoresis
Both 1D and 2D electrophoresis techniques were used to
identify anomalous migration behavior of fragments of
DNA from C.elegans. 2D gels were cast in 4% NuSieve agar-
ose gels using 1· TAE Buffer in the absence of ethidium
bromide. For DNA samples run with an internal standard, it
was important to avoid overloading of DNA and consequent
smearing of the first dimension during electrophoresis; this
was achieved by constructing single-tooth combs that were
relatively wide (2.5–5 mm) rather than the narrower combs
used in other 2D gel systems. The first ‘vertical’ direction
in all 2D gels was run at 53 V for 3 h in a cold room at
4C. At this voltage, heating by the electrophoretic current
was observed to be minimal. Each gel was then soaked for
2 h in 1· TAE Buffer with ethidium bromide (0.3 mg/ml)
at room temperature. Next, the second dimension (horizontal
direction in the 2D gels) was run with the gel box at room
temperature at 80 V for 2 h. Temperatures are somewhat
raised by the higher voltage of the second dimension electro-
phoresis, and were estimated to be 37C.
Similar analysis using 1D electrophoresis was carried out
by running two separate gels on each sample. One gel was
cast with 0.3 mg/ml ethidium bromide present and run at
60 V for 6 h at room temperature, while the other was cast
with no intercalator present and run at 30 V for 15 h in a
cold room at 4C and then stained with ethidium bromide
(2.0 mg/ml) in 1· TAE for 1 h. Although the two gel systems
are comparable in resolution, the paired 1D gels offer the
ability to analyze greater numbers of samples, while the 2D
gels allow more sensitive detection of modest electrophoretic
anomalies.
Sample preparation and AFM imaging
DNA samples for AFM imaging were prepared by depositing
5 ng of DNA, diluted in 6 ml of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0)
and then supplemented with 15 mM MgCl2, onto freshly
cleaved mica. After 60 s, the mica was washed with MilliQ-
filtered water and blown dry in a gentle stream of nitrogen
gas. Samples were imaged at 1.95 nm per pixel resolution

in air at room temperature and humidity using tapping mode.
We used an AFM from Nanotec (Nanotec Electro´nica, Mad-
rid, Spain) and also a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments,
Santa Barbara, CA). We utilized tapping mode SuperSharp-
Silicon tips, type SSS-NCH-8 (Nanosensors, Neuchaˆtel, Swit-
zerland). Image processing, including plane subtraction and
flattening, was done using WSxM freeware (www.nanotec.
es). Traces were obtained using the tracing routine described
in (P.A. Wiggins, T. van der Heijden, F. Moreno-Herrero,
A. Spakowitz, R. Phillips, J. Widom, C. Dekker and
P.C. Nelson, manuscript submitted).
Calculation of periodicity value and predictions of
curvature
Calculations of predicted radius of curvature for DNA seg-
ments and of overall periodicity used several available
algorithms (5,7,19) (see also Supplementary Data). Source

RESULTS
Periodic DNA segments from C.elegans
We chose a number of hyperperiodic DNA fragments from
C.elegans for analysis based on the relevance of the proteins
that they encode and on the periodicity value provided by the
PATC algorithm described in Ref. (19). This algorithm is by
no means unique and we note that many different algorithms
identify a strongly periodic character to C.elegans DNA
(data not shown) and could have been used to select specific
fragments. For reference, the PATC algorithm returns a
numerical score with greater numbers indicating more highly
periodic character. A score of >95 is reached at <106 fre-
quency in a random sequence with base composition equival-
ent to C.elegans. There is no segment in the entire unique
genomes of Drosophila melanogaster (euchromatin) or
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (two genomes with comparable
AT content to C.elegans) with a periodicity score >200. Of
the natural bent DNAs that have been analyzed previously
on a biophysical level, only the mitochondrial DNA of
Crithidia shows a substantial signal in the PATC assay
(a score of 235 maintained over a distance of 175 bp).
Supplementary Figure S2 shows the periodicity values as
a function of sequence for the DNAs used in this work.
Fragment W4 is a 932 bp segment comprising the fourth
intron of C.elegans gene F54C4.1 on chromosome III. The
F54C4.1 gene is essential, encodes mitochondrial ribosomal
protein L40, and is likely expressed in both somatic and
germline tissue of the animal. The intron 4 fragment W4
was chosen from among the many hyperperiodic segments
in the C.elegans genome based on its localization in a well-
defined essential gene. Informatic analysis of fragment W4
using the PATC algorithm (19) or standard bending
algorithms (5,7) indicated a degree of periodicity that is char-
acteristic of a subset of germline-expressed C.elegans genes
but which has not been seen outside of nematode DNA.
Using the PATC algorithm, an average score of 433 for the
W4 fragment was observed. This magnitude of score has

the molecule is independent of the particular end chosen as a starting point. Capital case letters denote the hyperperiodic fragment W4 from C.elegans.

respectively.

never been observed in random DNA or in the genomes of
non-nematode species. Of sequences in the W4 fragment
89.7% have PATC scores above 95 (the cutoff for 106
occurrence in random DNA).
Several other fragments have also been analyzed in this
work. Fragment W6 is a strongly periodic 147 bp segment
comprising the third intron of C.elegans gene ZK792.7 on
chromosome IV. The gene is predicted to encode a protein
with metallophosphoesterase activity. The periodicity value
of W6 is 122 with 76.9% of the sequences with PATC scores
above 95. Fragment W6 was originally isolated among a set
of random clones of Microccocal nuclease treated C.elegans
lysates, consistent with the possibility that this fragment rep-
resents a single nucleosome core (25). We stress, however,
that no further in vivo analysis has been carried out on this
segment of the chromosome.
As controls, we have examined the behavior of several
DNAs which had no unusual periodic character. These
include lambda DNA, pUC plasmid backbones and W7, a dis-
tinct C.elegans genome fragment. Fragment W7 was 150 bp
and was also derived from Micrococcal nuclease digestion
of C.elegans lysates, but did not show distinct periodicity.
W7 is an exonic fragment from gene Y38F1A.3. Table 1
summarizes the DNAs employed in this study including the
origin of the DNA, the periodicity value and the derived
AFM construct.
From the periodicities above one would expect unusually
bent DNA structures for the fragments W4 and W6, but not
for W7. We tested this prediction by gel electrophoresis,
which exactly confirmed the expectations (Figure 2). Each
of the hyperperiodic fragments (W4 and W6) was retarded
compared to size markers, with retardation relieved at higher
temperatures and with the addition of an intercalating agent
(ethidium bromide) during electrophoresis. In contrast, the
non-periodic fragment W7 did not show any retardation.
Interestingly, our observations were made using agarose gel
electrophoresis, which has not been seen to distinguish

fragments (indicated by arrows) migrated more slowly than one would expect on the basis of its length. Similar anomalies were observed when using 2% agarose
gels (data not shown). Gel electrophoresis on fragments SQ100 (185 bp, non-periodic, lane 3) and SQ322 (182 bp, hyperperiodic, lane 4) run at 37C with EtBr

slowly than expected.

anomalies were observed in other two different hyperperiodic
fragments from C.elegans (data not shown).
Single-molecule AFM imaging
After the electrophoresis experiments indicated the presence
of unusual DNA structures, we analyzed our samples
with quantitative AFM analysis. The different DNA
samples were imaged at high resolution and traced using a
custom-written tracing routine. Typically, measured DNA
profiles displayed a width of 4–7 nm at half height. We
imaged the PPC (2885 bp), the control DNA (2743 bp) and
the short C.elegans fragments (182 and 185 bp). Figure 3a
shows an image of the PPC, where two DNA molecules are
visible. The average measured contour length L0 was 1032 ±
27 nm, yielding a rise per bp of 0.36 ± 0.01 nm. To illustrate
the analysis, we plotted in Figure 3b an example of a single
trace. The tracing routine accurately generates XY pairs sep-
arated by ‘ ¼ 2.5 nm that follow the contour of the molecule.
We found this length to be the lowest meaningful length that
faithfully followed the contour given the pixel size of the
images, 1.95 nm, and the high resolution obtained by using
ultra-sharp tips. A magnification of the trace illustrates the
three quantities deduced that are important for the analysis
that follows (Figure 3b, inset). These are the contour length
spacing L (in the example, L equals 3 · 2.5 ¼ 7.5 nm), and
the end-to-end distance R. Clearly, a given contour length
spacing L can be associated with several values of R (three
of them are plotted in the inset). The inset also shows the def-
inition of curvature, C. The curvature of a 10 nm long seg-
ment is defined as the inverse of the radius r of the circle
that encompasses three points separated by 5 nm (showing
in red in the inset in Figure 3b).
High-resolution AFM images of the short DNA samples,
SQ100 and SQ322, are shown in Figure 3c and d. Figure 3c
corresponds to the non-periodic sequence and Figure 3d to
the hyperperiodic one. By eye, one can already notice that
Figure 3d displays more bent molecules. This was confirmed
in the subsequent numerical and analytical analysis (see
below). Insets represent histograms of contour lengths for
each sample. They show that our tracing routine precisely
deduces the contour length with a standard deviation of
3 nm. For samples SQ100 and SQ322, 692 and 653 molecules
were analyzed, respectively.
Single molecule AFM-based quantitative analysis of
hyperperiodic C.elegans DNA
A quantitative analysis of the traces of hyperperiodic DNA
showed systematic deviations from the worm-like-chain
(WLC) model consistent with extra bending induced by

data analysis and tracing of the DNA molecules. A segmented line made of points separated by ‘ ¼ 2.5 nm follows the contour of the molecule. The important
parameters we employ are the contour length spacing L, the end-to-end distance R and the curvature C defined as the inverse of the curvature radius r that
embraces three contour points, C ¼ 1/r. In the inset in (b), these parameters are shown together with an example of three values of R for the same contour length
spacing L, in this case L ¼ 3 · ‘ ¼ 7.5 nm. We also show an example for the calculation of r for three points separated by L ¼ 2 · ‘ ¼ 5 nm (red arc). (c) AFM

sequence periodicity. As described by Rivetti et al. (26) DNA
equilibrates on a mica surface when adsorption is promoted
by divalent ions such as Mg2+. The behavior of DNA
molecules under these conditions can be predicted by the
WLC model (26). The WLC describes a mean trajectory of
the polymer on the mica with the following equation:
hR2s‚ sþLi ¼ 4P

L þ 2PðeL/ð2PÞ  1Þ‚ 1
where P is the persistence length of the polymer, L is the con-
tour length spacing and hR2s‚ sþLi is the mean-squared separa-
tion between points along the chains located at distances
s and s+L from the end of the molecule. The average is com-
puted over s and over all observed contours. The averaging is
done up to the upper limit in the contour length of the
molecule L0 (for the PPC, L0 equals 325 nm) minus the con-
tour length spacing L analyzed, thus 0 < s < L0  L.
Using this analysis, the control DNA and the non-periodic
short fragment SQ100 displayed exactly the behavior pre-
dicted by the WLC model; the hyperperiodic DNA, however,
did not. Figure 4a shows hR2s‚ sþLiversus L for the Control
and PPC samples. We calculated hR2s‚ sþLi up to a contour
length spacing of L ¼ 200 nm. This is because the length
of the segment studied in the PPC was 325 nm, necessarily
restricting one to values of L < L0 to obtain a statistically
reliable calculation for all L. For consistency, we also used
an upper limit for L of 200 nm for the control DNA. A fit
using Equation 1 was done for the control DNA (Figure 4a,
black line). The fit yielded a value for the persistence length
of 51 nm, in agreement with published results (26,27). These
data were consistent with the hypothesis that our sample pre-
paration yields contours that reflect equilibrium 2D chain
conformations. We repeated the same type of analysis on
the PPC, tracing 325 nm (953 bp) from both ends. The use
of a palindrome construct is very convenient because it avoids
ambiguity in the sequence analyzed: the traced fragments
always included the hyperperiodic Fragment W4 from
C.elegans independently of which end was selected. In this
way, 190 fragments coming from three sets of experiments
done on different days, mica surfaces and preparations were
traced and analyzed. Remarkably, the same analysis done on
the PPC showed significantly smaller hR2s‚ sþLi than predicted
by the WLC model (Figure 4a), which is indicative of extra
bending. To guide the eye we included plots of Equation 1
using P ¼ 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 nm (solid lines in
Figure 4a). The PPC data curves mostly overlaid the curve
of P ¼ 30 nm. It should be noted, though, that the WLC
model does not necessarily hold for intrinsically curved DNA.
We conducted a similar analysis using samples SQ100
and SQ322. In this case due to the shorter length of the
molecules we plotted hR2s‚ sþLi up to a contour length spacing
of L ¼ 47.5 nm (Figure 4b). This required tracing many more
molecules to have comparable statistics with those for the
PPC sample. We traced 692 and 653 molecules for SQ100
and SQ322, respectively. The analysis showed that SQ322

total, 190 PPC fragments were studied. The control DNA follows the prediction given by the worm-like-chain model with a persistence length of 51 nm. The
hyperperiodic DNA regions from the C.elegans genome clearly show a very different behavior, characterized by lower <R2>. To guide the eye, predictions from
WLC with different values for the persistence length are included (solid grey). The five curves included are for P ¼ 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 nm. The slope of the
curves increases as P increases. Bending of the DNA, is evidenced by lower <R2> than predicted by WLC. (c) Normalized histograms of absolute curvature |C|

independently of the spacing L [inset in (c)]. Bins and associated errors (square root of number of points in the bin) were normalized by the area of the histogram.
We note that occasionally one cannot distinguish the error bars because they are smaller than the points.

contours had smaller mean squared end-to-end distances than
those of non-periodic SQ100 (Figure 4b). To stress the
significance of the result, we included in Figure 4b plots of
Equation 1 with P ¼ 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 nm to guide the
eye. Whereas SQ100 data lay as expected between the curves
of P ¼ 50 and 60 nm, SQ322 data overlaid the curve of
P ¼ 25 nm.
Summarizing the results from these different DNA samples
(Figure 4a and b), we find consistently that hyperperiodic
DNA results in a shorter hR2s‚ sþLi than predicted by the
WLC at the two length scales studied: hundreds of bp and
tens of bp. This can be most easily explained by increased
bending of the DNA. Furthermore, the plot for hR2s‚ sþLi
deviates from the WLC at lower persistence length. This
suggests that the increase in bending is not due to an increase
in random bending/flexibility, which would exhibit WLC
behavior, but rather due to non-random bending.
The presence of increased bending in hyperperiodic
C.elegans DNA compared to non-periodic DNA was further
supported by examining distributions of absolute curvatures
jCj. We calculated curvatures from traces at a fixed spacing
L (see inset in Figure 3b as an example, for L ¼ 5 nm). To
do this, we fitted a circle to three points separated by
L along the contour of the DNA. The curvature (C) at this
spacing is defined as the inverse of the radius of that circle
and its value was assigned to the middle point of the three
contour points. Hence to calculate Ci at a given position
i, for a given L, we used DNA stretches of 2 · L nm. Then
we moved to the next point i + ‘ along the contour, which
is ‘ ¼ 2.5 nm (7 bp) apart from the previous, and we obtained
a new value of Ci+‘. We arbitrarily assigned positive curva-
ture if by progressing along the DNA the contour turned to
the right, and we assigned negative curvature if it turned
to the left. As expected, we found Gaussian distributions of
C centered at zero for all type of molecules studied, proving
no preferential curvature orientations due to adsorption (data
not shown).
Absolute curvatures jCj distributions were calculated at
different values of L. Figure 4c shows absolute curvature
distributions for the PPC and the control non-periodic DNA
for L ¼ 5 nm. We analyzed 100 control DNA molecules,
which yielded 12 000 curvature values, and 190 PPC
molecules, which yielded 24 000 curvature values.
Figure 4d shows similar absolute curvature distributions for
the short DNA fragments studied, SQ100 (non-periodic)
and SQ322 (highly-periodic). We analyzed 613 SQ100 and
567 SQ322 molecules, each yielding 12 000 curvature values.
Distributions were normalized to have an area of one, and
error bars denote normalized square root of number of points
in the bin. All absolute curvature distributions were fit with a
Gaussian function centered at curvature zero. From these fits
we extracted the standard deviation sC. The values sC of the
Control, PPC, SQ100 and SQ322 samples from curvature his-
tograms calculated using a spacing of L ¼ 5 and 25 nm are
quoted in Table 2 (the latter only for long DNAs). Systemat-
ically, we found that DNA with hyperperiodic sequences had
larger sC than non-periodic DNA. This was found to be inde-
pendent of the spacing L used to calculate curvatures up to
50 nm. The inset in Figure 4c proves this by showing jCj dis-
tributions for PPC and control samples calculated at a larger
spacing of L ¼ 25 nm. Spacings larger than 50 nm, the per-
sistence length of the DNA, did not generate statistically sig-
nificant curvature distributions.
Intrinsic curvature in hyperperiodic C.elegans DNA
In principle, a broad jCj distribution could result from either
increased flexibility or intrinsic curvature (Supplementary
Data). In order to determine which of the two phenomena
dominates in our hyperperiodic DNA, we performed two cal-
culations: (i) we calculated the distance over which the hand-
edness of the curvature persists, and (ii) we calculated an
average curvature per single imaged AFM molecule and con-
sidered its absolute value j<C>moleculej.
One way to measure the persistence of handedness is to
plot a correlation function CCL,D of the form:
CCL‚ D ¼
PL0D
s CL;sCL;sþDPL0D
s jCL;sjjCL;sþDj
‚ 2
where CL,s is the curvature calculated at spacing L at position
s and L0 is the total contour length of the molecule. CL,s can
therefore be positive or negative as defined above. The func-
tion CCL,D involves addition over all the molecules con-
sidered in this study, 100 for the control DNA and 190 for
the PPC. To examine the persistence of handedness, renor-
malization was included to compare the two datasets. For a
given spacing L, CCL,D is a function that depends on the cor-
relation spacing D. Figure 5a shows a plot of CCL,D for L ¼ 5,
15 and 25 nm for the PPC (dashed lines) and the control DNA
(solid lines). Systematically, a significantly larger correlation
distance was found for the hyperperiodic DNA than for the
non-periodic DNA. As expected, at large correlation spacing
D, the correlation function approached zero for non-periodic
DNA, showing that the ‘memory’ of handedness is lost very
quickly. Interestingly, for hyperperiodic DNA the correla-
tion function approaches a non-zero value, for large

D. Qualitatively similar correlation functions were predicted
from theoretical calculations for chains with long-range cor-
relations (28). Therefore, these data are strongly indicative of
the presence of an intrinsic bend rather than increased
flexibility.
A complementary approach to the correlation distance con-
sisted of calculating an average curvature per molecule and
taking its absolute value j<C>moleculej. The distributions of
absolute curvature per molecule are shown in Figure 5b and c.
The statistics in these experiments is poorer (resulting in lar-
ger error bars) than in the jCj distributions (shown in
Figure 4c and d), as per definition the total number of values
for the histogram equals the number of molecules imaged.
Figure 5b shows j<C>moleculej distributions for the PPC and
the non-periodic control DNA, and Figure 5c shows
j<C>moleculej for the SQ100 and SQ322 fragments. Distribu-
tions were calculated using a spacing of L ¼ 5 nm to calculate
the curvature values, except the inset in Figure 5b, which
used L ¼ 25 nm. The distributions were fit with Gaussian
functions. As expected, the distributions for both non-
periodic DNA molecules had a maximum at curvature zero.
However, the distributions for the two hyperperiodic
DNA samples displayed an offset, j<C>0,molecule L¼5 nmj of
0.01 nm1. This implies that a given molecule has the tend-
ency to bend either more towards the right than towards the
left or vice versa. This observation can only be explained by
the presence of an intrinsic curvature, as the distributions for
the ‘random’ control DNAs had a maximum at around zero.
We note that the effect is more pronounced for the long DNA
samples, as here more curvature values contribute to the
mean curvature, which can directly be seen from the width
of the distributions s<C>molecule (Table 2). Similar conclusions
can be drawn from the analysis done at L ¼ 25 nm (inset in
Figure 5b), showing that the detection of an intrinsic bend is
independent of the spacing L used.
DISCUSSION
We report anomalous gel migration of several fragments of
the nematode C.elegans genome with unusual periodicity of
AA/TT dinucleotides. AFM allowed detailed characterization
of the bending of these DNA structures showing that PATCs
generate intrinsic bending. Despite the presence of an
intrinsic bend, the AFM images also showed that hyperperi-
odic DNA can still adopt a wide range of bending configura-
tions (Figure 3d), suggesting that flexibility is retained.
In order to be able to extract quantitative information
related to bending of DNA, we first verified that our DNA
contours reflect 2D equilibrium states and that the average
behavior can be accurately described by the WLC model.
For this, we used as a control the plasmid pGem-3Z, which
had no unusual periodic character. We observed that the aver-
age trajectory of adsorbed control DNA molecules fulfilled
several criteria: (i) the distribution of curvatures was Gaus-
sian (Figure 4c, black squares), and (ii) the mean square
end-to-end distance followed Equation 1 with the accepted
value for the persistence length (Figure 4a, black squares).
Thus, we conclude that the WLC describes accurately the
average trajectory of our molecules and that these trajectories
reflect equilibrium states of the molecules on the mica sur-
face. The fact that the control DNA molecules are equilib-
rated on the surface is crucial for allowing us to extend the

Control DNA calculated for curvatures measured at contour length separations of L ¼ 5, 15 and 25 nm. A long-range persistence of handedness in hyperperiodic
DNA is evident from the graph, indicating the presence of intrinsic bending. (b) Normalized histograms of absolute mean curvatures per molecule |<C>molecule|

Hyperperiodic DNA showed a preferred mean curvature per molecule of 0.01 nm1 at L ¼ 5 nm, consistent with the presence of intrinsic bending. Bins and
associated errors (square root of number of points in the bin) were normalized by the area of the histogram.

same analysis to DNAs with hyperperiodic sequences. Plots
of mean squared end-to-end distances of hyperperiodic
DNA samples, PPC (Figure 4a, colored symbols) and
SQ322 (Figure 4b, red circles), showed that AA/TT period-
icity induces extra bending in the DNA structure. This was
demonstrated by significant deviations of the hyperperiodic
DNA from the predictions of the WLC model using a persist-
ence length of 50 nm.
Subsequent analysis to determine the source of this devi-
ation took into account distributions of absolute values of cur-
vatures jCj. As a check for the validity of this analysis, we
found that curvature distributions had a maximum at zero,
showing equal probability for the observation of positive
and negative curvatures. The value sC (Table 2) obtained
from Gaussian fits to the jCj distributions indicated how
often large curvatures were present in the trace or the degree
of bendability. Figure 4c and d showed that hyperperiodic
DNA (PPC and SQ322) accommodates high curvatures
more readily than non-periodic DNA (Control and SQ100).
However, it is not possible from the value of sC alone to attri-
bute the increased presence of high curvatures to increased
flexibility or to the presence of intrinsic bends: indeed either
intrinsic curvature or unusual flexibility will widen the C
distribution (Supplementary Data). Nevertheless, it is accur-
ate to say that if the DNA does not have an intrinsic bend,
then the value of sC directly reflects the degree of flexibility.
One characteristic feature of the C.elegans hyperperiodic
sequences analyzed in this work is the distance over which
substantial periodicity is maintained. In the AFM images,
this corresponds to what appears to be a considerable distance
over which the handedness of the curvature persists
(Figure 3a). We quantified the distance D over which handed-
ness was correlated using Equation 2. These correlation plots
were computed for the PPC and the Control DNA (Figure 5a).
It was observed that at a given distance D the probability of
finding a curvature with the same sign was significantly
higher in the hyperperiodic DNA than in non-periodic
DNA. The curvature correlation increased with larger values
of L. This indicates that AA/TT periodicity induces a long-
scale effect in the structure of DNA and provides a strong
argument for bending as opposed to flexibility, since flexibil-
ity would definitely not increase the correlation distance. In
principle, the process of adsorption itself could cause switch-
ing of handedness as the DNA might flip over at certain
points, leading to an underestimation of the correlation
distance D, compared to the 3D structure in solution.
A complementary approach to analyze the presence or
absence of long-scale correlated intrinsic bends consists of
calculating the mean curvatures per molecule (Figure 5b
and c). This analysis showed a maximum at zero for the
non-periodic DNA samples (control and SQ100), in agree-
ment with purely random bending. A clear peak, however,
was found for both of the hyperperiodic DNA samples
(PPC and SQ322), suggesting the presence of a large-scale
intrinsic bend with an average curvature of 0.01 nm1
(at L ¼ 5 nm). It should be noted that we underestimate the
bending of the DNA, because it is not clear how the bent
regions absorb to the mica, resulting in a mixture of regions
with positive and negative curvature. The absence of intrinsic
bending for the non-periodic SQ100 DNA suggests that its
widened curvature distribution (Figure 4d) could be due to
an increase in flexibility compared to the non-periodic Con-
trol (Figure 4c). For hyperperiodic DNA, however, it was
not possible to address flexibility, as flexibility is convoluted
by intrinsic bending in the curvature distributions. However,
the variety of shapes displayed in the AFM images
(Figure 3d) indicated that hyperperiodic DNA seems to be
flexible enough to adopt straight and strongly bent conforma-
tions.
DNA sequences from numerous organisms have been
shown to contain regions with periodic character correspond-
ing to the helical repeat of 10–10.5 bp. Despite a number of
cases in which structural roles have been assigned to relat-
ively short periodic regions (17), the functions of extended
periodic regions in DNA are unknown. Of the numerous
‘model’ genomes that have been subject to intensive analysis,
C.elegans has (at least by some measures) the strongest peri-
odicity signal (19,24). Given that 1–2% of the base pairs in
the C.elegans genome appear constrained by their contribu-
tion to periodic character (19), it seems likely that these
sequences have substantial roles in the evolution and/or func-
tion of the genome. One role that has been considered by vir-
tually every investigator who has studied these sequences has
been to constrain or otherwise influence nucleosome position-
ing. Despite these proposals, it remains a possibility that other
extended surfaces in the nucleus are implicated in the
observed long-range sequence relationships.
In summary, we analyzed molecules with a greater degree
and extent of periodicity than any previously analyzed DNA.
We used gel electrophoresis and AFM to investigate the
effect of long PATCs in the structure of the genome of the
nematode C.elegans. Gel electrophoresis showed that hyper-
periodic DNA migrates more slowly than non-periodic DNA.
We quantified trajectories of equilibrated molecules on a
mica surface obtained with high-resolution AFM, and proved
that the PATCs exhibit large-scale intrinsic bending. This
explained the anomalous gel migration. Finally, we studied
two nucleosome-length DNA fragments that survived vigor-
ous Micrococcal nuclease digestion in situ, and likewise
found the presence of an intrinsic bend for the fragment con-
taining hyperperiodic sequences. The fragment without
intrinsic bending exhibited increased flexibility. This is con-
sistent with the idea that bendability of the DNA might be a
relevant factor in promoting binding to nucleosomes.
