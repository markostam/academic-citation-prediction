ABSTRACT
Whether population regulation is global or local determines if hard or soft selection, respect-
ively, is operating. Differences between hard and soft selection, in turn, affect the maintenance
of genetic variation and the mean strength of natural selection in heterogeneous environments.
Here we investigated whether there were differences in the strength of soft and hard selection on
plant defence traits in a spatially replicated field experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana. We
estimated selection gradients for basal branch number and susceptibility to apical meristem
herbivory in 10 spatial environments of an Arabidopsis field experiment. Net patterns of soft
selection across these 10 spatial environments were calculated as weighted averages of the
selection gradients, weighted by the frequency of each environment. Hard selection was
estimated in a similar fashion, except that selection gradients for each spatial environment were
first multiplied by a fitness ratio that assigned more or less weight to selection gradients
depending on whether local mean fitness in that environment was greater or less than global
mean fitness across all environments. In general, soft selection was stronger than hard selection,
possibly because selection on plant defence traits is relaxed in environments that otherwise
lead to high fitness. To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the frequency of spatial
environments, we repeated our analyses under several different hypothetical scenarios in which
we varied the cumulative frequency of the environments that led to highest fitness. In these
analyses, we found that the mean strength of hard and soft selection, and the relative magnitude
of the two estimates, varied greatly depending on the frequency of high fitness environments.
These analyses also revealed that estimates of the overall pattern of selection in spatially
heterogeneous environments can be very sensitive to the frequency of individual, unusual
environments – for example, environments with above average fitness but local patterns of
selection dramatically different from other above average fitness environments. We suggest that
more empirical effort be devoted to characterizing the frequency of selective environments in
natural systems, although that is likely to be extremely challenging.

INTRODUCTION
Population regulation is an important factor in determining how evolution will occur in
spatially heterogeneous environments. At one end of the spectrum, population regulation
can be local – for example, plant populations that are regulated within individual patches.
At the other end of the spectrum, population regulation can be global – for example,
plant populations that are regulated at the forest level containing several suitable patches.
These two alternative modes of population regulation lead to two different models
of evolution: soft and hard selection (Levene, 1953; Dempster, 1955; Wallace, 1968; Wade, 1985; Gomulkiewicz
et al., 2000).
Soft selection is a model of selection in which population regulation is local. Levene (1953)
proposed the model of soft selection to predict the maintenance of allelic polymorphisms in
a population with multiple niches. Under soft selection, successfully breeding individuals
are limited by factors independent of genotype or patch fitness (Levene, 1953; Wallace, 1968; Holsinger
and Pacala, 1990). The proportion of gametes contributed to the next generation from each
patch is directly proportional to the frequency of the patch in the entire population
(Christiansen, 1975). In a model of soft selection, all patches contribute equally to the subsequent
generation (Juenger et al., 2000).
In contrast to soft selection, hard selection is a model in which a population is
globally regulated (Dempster, 1955), and the maintenance of genetic variation depends on
the fitness of individuals within a given patch. Successfully breeding individuals are
determined by a strict fitness cut-off, and only the individuals that meet the fitness
criterion contribute offspring to the subsequent generation (Wallace, 1968). The proportion
of gametes contributed by each patch is dependent on the fitness of individuals in the
patch relative to the mean fitness of the population (Christiansen, 1975). Therefore, regardless
of the size of the patch, patches with higher fitness contribute substantially more
individuals to the subsequent generation under a model of hard selection (Via and Lande, 1985;
Gomulkiewicz et al., 2000).
The mode of population regulation determines which model of selection, soft or hard,
is appropriate for estimating whether genetic variation can be maintained in a spatially
heterogeneous environment, and understanding the evolutionary dynamics of a trait
or multiple traits in the population (Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick, 1992). Although some
researchers have attempted to predict whether hard or soft selection will differ depend-
ing on life-history stage (Holsinger and Pacala, 1990), there are few empirical studies of hard
and soft selection on specific phenotypic traits (but see Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick, 1992;
Juenger et al., 2000).
There is appreciable evidence to suggest that hard and soft selection are both likely to
contribute to the evolution of plant traits (Kelly, 1997). For instance, natural selection on plant
traits is frequently heterogeneous on a small spatial scale (Hartgerink and Bazzaz, 1984; Kalisz, 1986;
Schmitt and Antonovics, 1986; Antonovics et al., 1987; Stewart and Schoen, 1987; Schmitt and Gamble, 1990; Bell et al., 1991;
Stratton, 1994), suggesting that differences between hard and soft selection are likely to be
common for many plant traits. In addition, plant populations often exist in patches of
varying size and spatial scale, with pollen and seed dispersal ranges that are often larger
than the patches that the populations are located in. Such spatial variation in the strength of
natural selection, the distribution of plant populations, and the range of seed and pollen
dispersal all suggest the importance of hard and soft selection (Kelly, 1997). However, the
consequences of hard and soft selection are largely unknown for quantitative traits. In part,
Kelley et al.288
this is because much of the historic literature on hard and soft selection focuses on the
maintenance of genetic variation at the allelic level (Levene, 1953; Dempster, 1955; Wallace, 1968).
Although the role of hard and soft selection in the evolution of quantitative traits has been
well explored theoretically (Via and Lande, 1985; Holsinger and Pacala, 1990; van Tienderen, 1991), few
researchers have examined it empirically (but see Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick, 1992; Juenger et al., 2000).
Consequently, it is difficult to determine if any general patterns are evident. We therefore
asked the following questions: (1) Does selection on plant defence traits in the genetic model
organism Arabidopsis thaliana differ under models of soft and hard selection? (2) How
sensitive are estimates of the strength of soft and hard selection to the frequency of selective
environments?
METHODS
Study species
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) (Brassicaceae) is a self-fertilizing annual plant that is a model
organism for genetic and ecological studies (e.g. Mauricio et al., 1997; Bergelson et al., 2001; Kliebenstein et
al., 2001; Pigliucci, 2003). In a recent field experiment, we used the Landsberg erecta × Columbia
recombinant inbred lines developed by Lister and Dean (1993) that are available from the
Arabidopsis stock centre (www.arabidopsis.org). Because Arabidopsis undergoes many
generations of selfing after rare outcrossing events, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) may be
a close approximation to natural Arabidopsis populations (Weinig et al., 2002). The data used
in our analysis were originally collected and analysed by Weinig et al. (2002, 2003a). As full
details of the field methods are given by Weinig et al. (2002, 2003a), only a brief summary is
presented here.
Experimental design
Seeds from 98 RILs were planted in randomized flats in the Brown University greenhouse.
After germination, the seedlings were transplanted to a field plot at Brown’s Haffenreffer
Reserve, Bristol, Rhode Island. Replicate seedlings from each RIL were sown into
30 randomized blocks in the field. Plantings occurred in the fall and spring to simulate fall
and spring germinating cohorts. Replication of each RIL was one per block. To increase the
number of individuals per block per RIL, we combined the 30 blocks in the field into ten
superblocks for analysis; this was achieved by grouping the three nearest neighbouring
blocks in the field into triangular superblocks. Each superblock constitutes a different
spatial environment.
During the experiment, the plants experienced a considerable amount of apical meristem
damage, which circumstantial evidence suggested was due to rabbit herbivory (e.g. Weinig et al.,
2003a,b). We estimated apical meristem damage (AMD) as either present (1) or absent (0)
on each individual plant; taking the mean AMD for an RIL (see below) estimates the
percentage of RIL replicates that received AMD (see Weinig et al., 2003a, for more details). Because
the intensity of AMD varied across the plot, we hypothesized that hard and soft selection
on plant defence traits may lead to qualitatively or quantitatively different evolutionary
dynamics for these traits. We therefore chose to analyse patterns of hard and soft selection
on susceptibility to AMD and basal branch number (a tolerance trait). Susceptibility
Selection on plant defence in Arabidopsis thaliana 289
to AMD increases the likelihood that an individual plant will experience damage, while
the number of basal branches on a plant affects a plant’s tolerance to herbivore damage
(Weinig et al., 2003a,b).
Statistical analysis
Experimentally observed patterns
For the first analysis, we estimated selection on susceptibility to AMD and basal branch
number separately for each season and superblock. Before analysis, we calculated the
average value of susceptibility to AMD, basal branch number and fruit number for each
RIL within each superblock for use in selection analyses. Our goal in utilizing the RIL
means within individual superblocks was to reduce the influence of environmental
covariances on our estimates of selection (Rausher, 1992; Stinchcombe et al., 2002). We estimated
directional selection gradients in each superblock as the partial regression coefficients from
a linear regression model with relativized fruit number, which is our estimate of fitness, as
the dependent variable, and both susceptibility to AMD and basal branch number as
independent variables. Fitness was relativized by dividing by overall mean fitness within
each superblock.
Under the model of soft selection, each environment contributes propagules in propor-
tion to the frequency of the environment. For this data set, the environments are the
superblocks, which occur with equal frequency of 0.1. To estimate the overall strength
of selection on susceptibility to AMD and basal branch number under a model of soft
selection, we computed a weighted average of the selection gradients for that trait, weighted
by the frequency of the superblock:
βs =
i 
 fiβi (1)
where fi is the frequency of the i th environment and βi is the selection gradient in the i th
environment. In this formulation (e.g. Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick, 1992), βs is the
overall strength of selection on the trait under soft selection. (Note that the sum of the
environmental frequencies equals one, i.e. 
i
 fi = 1.)
Under a model of hard selection, the relative fitness of the individuals in each superblock
influences the proportion of propagules contributed to the next generation. To estimate the
overall strength of selection on susceptibility to AMD and basal branch number under hard
selection, we computed a weighted average of the selection gradient by multiplying the
selection gradient for an individual environment by the frequency of that environment and
by a fitness ratio. The fitness ratio was the mean fitness in the individual superblock divided
by the mean overall fitness in the season. Thus, hard selection was estimated as:
βh =
i
 fiβiWiW¯¯¯  (2)
where fi is the frequency of the i th environment, βi is the selection gradient in the i th
environment, Wi is the mean fitness in the ith environment and W¯¯¯ is the grand mean of
Kelley et al.290
fitness in the season (Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick, 1992). For both hard and soft selection, we
present 95% confidence limits of the net patterns of selection as estimated by 1000
bootstraps.
We present unstandardized selection gradients rather than standardized selection
gradients for two reasons. First, our goal is to compare hard and soft selection for the same
trait, rather than to compare the strength of natural selection on traits measured in differ-
ent units. Second, the standard deviations for the traits vary considerably from superblock
to superblock. Accordingly, standardizing separately in each superblock can create the
impression that the pattern of selection on the traits differs between superblocks, even
when the estimated unstandardized selection gradients are similar or even identical. To
provide some intuitive understanding of the magnitude of the unstandardized selection
gradients, we also present fitness elasticities of susceptibility to AMD and basal branch
number – that is, the proportional change in relative fitness caused by a proportional
change in the trait (see, for example, Morgan and Schoen, 1997; van Tienderen, 2000; Hansen et al., 2003).
Operationally, this amounts to standardizing traits before analysis by dividing them by
their means, or multiplying unstandardized selection gradients by the mean of the trait
(for more details, see Morgan and Schoen, 1997; van Tienderen, 2000; Hansen et al., 2003). In this instance, we
multiplied the selection gradient for each superblock by the mean value of the trait in
that superblock.
Sensitivity to environmental frequencies
The calculations described above for soft and hard selection include the frequency
superblocks (see equations 1 and 2), which, in our experiment, were all equal to 0.1. How-
ever, the natural frequency of spatial and selective environments will rarely, if ever, be evenly
distributed. To study the sensitivity of the previous results to different environmental
frequencies, we used the following approach. First, for each season, we ranked each super-
block by its fitness ratio (Wi/W¯¯¯) to determine the best superblocks in each season (‘best’
in this case defined by superblocks with high relative fruit production within a season);
superblocks were ranked without regard to the strength of selection on either trait in that
superblock (see Table 1). We then varied the cumulative frequency of the top N superblocks
from zero to one systematically (in units of 0.025) and plotted how hard and soft selection
would change as these superblocks changed in frequency, for the top N = 2, 3 and 4
superblocks (as defined by their fitness ratios). In these analyses, the top N environments
were constrained to have equal frequency (i.e. the top two superblocks each ranged in
frequency from 0 to 50% for N = 2, the top three superblocks each ranged in frequency
from 0 to 33.3% for N = 3, and the top four superblocks each ranged in frequency from
0 to 25% for N = 4).
For example, for N = 2 superblocks, we calculated hard and soft selection when the top
two superblocks each ranged from 0 to 50% of the environments in which selection was
acting. This procedure was repeated in an iterative fashion, gradually increasing the
frequency of each of the top two superblocks from 0% to 2.5% to 5% and so on up to 50%
for each superblock. For each of these analyses, the frequency of selective environments
not made up by the top two superblocks was evenly distributed among the remaining
superblocks (e.g. if the top two superblocks each represented 20% of the selective environ-
ments, the remaining eight each represented 7.5% of selective environments; if the top
two superblocks each represented 30% of selective environments, the remaining eight each
represented 5% of the selective environments, and so on).

RESULTS
Experimentally observed patterns
To calculate hard and soft selection for susceptibility to AMD, we used the selection
gradients from each superblock (Table 1) regardless of their statistical significance. We
chose to retain these selection gradients in our calculations of the net pattern of hard and
soft selection (i.e. non-significant selection gradients were not set to zero when calculating
net patterns of hard and soft selection), because they represent the best estimate of the
actual strength of selection in that superblock (M. Kirkpatrick, personal communication)
and we were not testing hypotheses about the pattern of natural selection on these traits
within any individual superblock. In general, natural selection acted to reduce susceptibility
to AMD and to increase basal branch number, with some variation in the magnitude of
selection in each season and superblock. We did not observe any instances of significant
reversals in the sign or direction of natural selection across superblocks (i.e. there were no
cases of significant selection in favour of a trait in one superblock and significant selection
against the same trait in another superblock).
Using equations (1) and (2), the strength of selection on susceptibility to AMD in the fall
was −0.217 under a model of hard selection and −0.305 under a model of soft selection
(Table 2a), although the bootstrapped 95% confidence limits for these estimates overlapped.

selection were −0.18 and −0.22, respectively, suggesting that a 10% increase in susceptibility
to AMD leads to a 1.8 and 2.2% decrease in relative fitness. For the spring, the strength
of selection was −0.181 and −0.231 for hard and soft selection, respectively (Table 2b),
with non-overlapping 95% confidence limits. These selection gradients correspond to fitness
elasticities of −0.0355 and −0.0376, respectively, indicating that a 10% increase in
susceptibility to AMD in the spring would lead to a 0.35 and 0.37% decrease in relative
fitness. The point estimates for hard and soft selection, as well as the 95% confidence limits
for the spring cohort, both suggest that selection on susceptibility to AMD was stronger
under a model of soft selection – not only are the estimated overall selection gradients
larger, but proportional changes in susceptibility to AMD lead to greater proportional
changes in relative fitness under the soft selection model.
Using equations (1) and (2) to estimate the strength of selection on basal branch number
under models of soft and hard selection, respectively, we detected similar patterns in the
strength of hard and soft selection for the fall cohort. For the fall, the strength of selection
under a model of hard selection was 0.210, while under a model of soft selection the
strength of selection was 0.209 (Table 2a). These selection gradients correspond to fitness
elasticities for basal branch number of 0.75 and 0.61, indicating that proportional changes
in basal branch number had dramatic effects on relative fitness (i.e. a 10% change in basal
branch number would lead to either a 7.5 or 6.1% increase in relative fitness), and suggesting
a trend for the fitness impacts of changes in basal branch number to be greater under a
model of hard selection. In the spring cohort, selection on basal branch number was
reduced: the strength of selection was 0.151 under a model of hard selection and 0.141
under a model of soft selection (Table 2b). In addition, in the spring cohort, these selection
gradients correspond to much lower fitness elasticities – these selection gradients corre-
spond to fitness elasticities of 0.33 and 0.29, both of which indicate lower proportional
changes in relative fitness for a given percentage change in basal branch number. For both

the fall and spring cohorts, the trend for greater fitness elasticities under the hard selection
model appear to be due to the fact that superblocks with high fitness ratios (i.e. Wi /W¯¯¯ > 1)
also had higher means for basal branch number. In general, fitness elasticities for basal
branch number were higher, regardless of selection model, than fitness elasticities for
susceptibility to AMD, indicating that the proportional effects on relative fitness of changes
in basal branch number are greater than changes in susceptibility to AMD. These data are
consistent with previous reports of significant overlap between QTL mapped for fitness and
basal branch number in this experiment (Weinig et al., 2003a).
Sensitivity to environmental frequencies
Susceptibility to apical meristem damage
The strength of both hard and soft selection on susceptibility to AMD, and the relative
difference between the two, depends on the frequency of selective environments (e.g. Fig. 1).
For susceptibility to AMD in the fall cohort, the strength of soft selection declines as high
fitness superblocks become more and more common. In other words, when superblocks that
had high relative fruit production within a season represent a greater proportion of the
selective environments, the net strength of soft selection is reduced. The decline in the
strength of soft selection is most apparent when the top two superblocks are increasing in

frequency (solid diamonds in Fig. 1), whereas when the top three or four superblocks (solid
triangles and squares in Fig. 1) increase in frequency the strength of soft selection declines,
but not to the same extent. These trends are driven by the fact that natural selection on
susceptibility to AMD is, on average, weaker in these superblocks with high fitness ratios
than in the other superblocks (see below). The patterns for hard selection on susceptibility
to AMD are reversed – when the weighting ratio is added to the analysis, hard selection on
susceptibility to AMD becomes appreciably more negative (this result is most apparent
with the analyses of the top three and four superblocks). This apparently counter-intuitive
pattern is driven entirely by two superblocks (1 and 3 of Table 1) that have the second and
third highest fitness ratios and are also the superblocks in which we observed the third and
fourth strongest selection gradients on susceptibility to AMD. The trend is less pronounced
for the analyses of the top two superblocks, mainly because the superblock with the highest
fitness ratio (superblock 4) had the weakest overall pattern of selection on susceptibility to
AMD.
For the spring cohort, the strength of soft selection on susceptibility to AMD also
declined as high fitness superblocks increased in cumulative frequency (Fig. 2). Similar to
the fall cohort, this appears to be due to the strength of selection on AMD being reduced in
high fitness superblocks. Under a model of hard selection, these trends also appear to hold –
at least for the cases in which the top two and top three superblocks increase in cumulative
frequency. However, when the top four superblocks increase in frequency, hard selection

on susceptibility to AMD begins to decline slightly, mainly because the superblock
with the fourth highest fitness ratio was an environment (superblock 19) in which
selection on susceptibility to AMD was appreciably stronger than in the other top three
superblocks.
Basal branch number
The patterns we observed for hard and soft selection on basal branch number under
variable environmental frequencies were similar in both the fall and spring cohorts (Figs. 3
and 4). In general, under hard selection, the net strength of selection on basal branch
number increases in magnitude when high fitness environments increase in frequency (solid
symbols in Figs. 3 and 4). This pattern is driven by environments in which selection on basal
branch number was moderately strong and positive, receiving added weight due to the
fitness ratios that are greater than 1.
The strength of soft selection in the fall cohort appears to be largely insensitive to the
cumulative frequency of the top four superblocks (solid squares in Fig. 3), although the
strength of soft selection actually declines when only the top two or three superblocks
increase in cumulative frequency. The trend for soft selection to decline when the top two or
three superblocks increase in frequency is driven by the top superblock (#4), in which
selection on basal branch number was approximately half as strong as selection in the
second and third best superblocks. A similar pattern is seen for the strength of soft selection

in the spring cohort – as the cumulative frequency of the top three or four superblocks
increases, the strength of soft selection is relatively stable or mildly increasing. However,
the strength of soft selection actually declines when the top two superblocks increase in
cumulative frequency – in this case, driven by the second ranked superblock (#17) in which
selection on basal branch number was approximately one-quarter as strong as it was in the
first, third and fourth ranked superblocks.
DISCUSSION
Two major results emerge from our analysis of hard and soft selection on plant defence
traits in Arabidopsis thaliana: first, in general, it appears that the mean strength of soft
selection is greater than the mean strength of hard selection; and second, that the frequency
of selective environments has dramatic effects on the strength of hard and soft selection,
and the relative difference between the two.
Previous empirical studies of hard and soft selection on quantitative traits have failed
to reveal a clear consensus on how commonly these two models of selection result in
differences in the mean strength of selection, or evolutionary trajectory of traits. For
example, in simulation studies, Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick (1992) determined that differ-
ences between hard and soft selection could lead to the evolution of strikingly different

reaction norms of node number in response to light availability in the agricultural weed
Abutilon theophrasti. In contrast, Juenger et al. (2000) failed to detect significant differences
between hard and soft selection on node production, an important tolerance trait, in the
field gentian (Gentianella campestris). Our results for susceptibility to AMD in both
the spring and fall cohorts, and basal branch production in the fall cohort, are similar to
those of Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick (1992), in that we detected consistent differences
between hard and soft selection (in this case, finding that soft selection was of a greater
magnitude than hard selection). However, our results for basal branch production in the
spring cohort are similar to those of Juenger et al. (2000), in that we detected minimal
differences between hard and soft selection. Although we did detect a stronger pattern
of soft selection than hard selection on basal branch production, these results were
only detectable at the thousandth decimal place, a level of precision that is unlikely to be
obtainable in most field estimates of selection (see, for example, the standard errors of the
selection gradients in Table 1). Further evidence in support of this interpretation comes
from our analysis of the fitness elasticities for basal branch number under models of hard
and soft selection in the spring cohort: the percent change in relative fitness caused by
a fixed percentage change in basal branch production differed by only 0.4% between
models of soft and hard selection, also suggesting minimal differences between hard and
soft selection.
If soft selection was in fact acting on Arabidopsis in our experiment, our finding that soft
selection was of greater magnitude than hard selection stands in contrast to the theoretical
results presented by Holsinger and Pacala (1990). It is important to note, however, that our
results only bear on the consequences of what would occur if hard or soft selection were
acting, rather than which type of selection was in fact occurring in our experiment. In their
study, Holsinger and Pacala (1990) attempted to predict whether soft or hard selection was
likely to predominate for certain types of traits, or alleles for those traits. Their findings
suggested that soft selection appears to be the appropriate model of selection for traits
influencing early life-cycle attributes such as germination and establishment, because
germination and establishment are often space-limited life stages and not dependent on
overall population fitness. Holsinger and Pacala (1990) also suggested that hard selection
controls the evolution of late life-stage traits that depend on the genotypes found within
subpopulations, including survival and reproduction. Because both of the traits we studied
are expressed later in the life cycle of Arabidopsis – for instance, susceptibility to AMD can
only be expressed after the differentiation to the apical meristem and the transition to
flowering, and basal branches are often only initiated after flowering has occurred on the
apical meristem – we were unable to compare the consequences of hard and soft selection
on early versus late life-stage traits.
Our finding that the net pattern of selection on susceptibility to AMD was of greater
magnitude under a model of soft selection than under a model of hard selection suggests
that in good environments that would otherwise lead to higher fitness, resisting herbivory is
under weaker selection (Table 2, β column) and has lower proportional effects on fitness
(Table 2, elasticity column). Under a model of hard selection, good environments with local
mean fitness that is greater than the global mean fitness (i.e. Wi /W¯¯¯ > 1) are assigned more
weight in estimating the net pattern of selection. If, in these environments that led to above
average fitness, selection was relaxed on plant defence traits, the net pattern of selection
on these traits would be reduced under a model of hard versus soft selection because of
the additional weighting factor given to selection gradients that are smaller in absolute
Kelley et al.298
magnitude and the decreased weighting given to selection gradients that are larger
in absolute magnitude. Our data provide support for this hypothesis. For instance, in the
fall cohort, the average selection gradient for susceptibility to AMD in the superblocks
with the five highest fitness ratios was −0.17, while the average selection gradient for
susceptibility to AMD in the superblocks with the five lowest fitness ratios was −0.44.
Results from the spring cohort show a similar pattern: the average selection gradient for
susceptibility to AMD in the superblocks with the five highest fitness ratios was −0.09, while
the corresponding average of the selection gradients in the superblocks with the five lowest
fitness ratios was −0.37. Thus for both the fall and spring cohorts, it appeared that
susceptibility to AMD was under weaker selection in environments that otherwise led to
high fitness.
The frequency of selective environments is important for the evolution of plant traits
(Via and Lande, 1985; van Tienderen, 1991; Gomulkiewicz and Kirkpatrick, 1992). Yet, the natural distribution of
selective environments is largely unknown (but see Weis and Gorman, 1990; Kingsolver et al., 2001; Arnold
and Peterson, 2002; Huber et al., 2004), and selective environments are almost certainly not uniformly
and evenly distributed like our experimental superblocks. To evaluate the robustness of
experimentally observed results, we explored the strength of hard and soft selection under
different scenarios in which the cumulative frequency of high fitness environments was
altered. The results of these analyses speak to the importance of the frequency of selective
environments. For instance, changes in the cumulative frequency of high fitness environ-
ments often led to dramatic changes in the magnitude of the net pattern of selection
(e.g. Fig. 1, open triangles). Depending on the cumulative frequency of the high fitness
environments, we either observed all the possible configurations of the relative strength of
the point estimates for hard or soft selection: hard selection being of greater, approximately
equal or less magnitude than soft selection.
The sensitivity of our selection estimates to the frequency of environments also illustrates
the potential effect of one or two unrepresentative environments on the overall pattern of
hard and soft selection. In general, we found that selection on susceptibility to AMD was
weaker in high fitness environments (see above), contributing to our overall finding of
weaker patterns of hard selection. However, in varying the cumulative frequency of the high
fitness environments for the fall cohort, we found a counter-intuitive trend for natural
selection on susceptibility to AMD to become stronger (Fig. 1, open symbols). This trend is
entirely driven by two superblocks with strong selection on susceptibility to AMD and high
fitness ratios, and exists despite the overall pattern in our data for selection on susceptibility
to AMD to be weaker in environments with high fitness ratios. These results illustrate the
imperfect correlation between an environment’s quality (i.e. its fitness ratio) and the
strength of selection in that environment. In addition, if by chance we had only sampled
these regions of the field for this experiment (or a smaller experiment, for example), we
might have obtained a dramatically different picture of the nature of selection on suscepti-
bility to AMD. Taken together, our analyses of how selection on susceptibility to AMD and
basal branch number changes with the cumulative frequency of high fitness environments
suggest that greater empirical effort should be devoted to measuring the frequency of
selective environments – despite the considerable logistical, experimental and statistical
challenge of doing so.
The spatial variability of the environment will also affect the magnitude of the differences
between hard and soft selection. For instance, there will be little or no difference in the
calculated strength of selection between models of hard and soft selection in spatially
Selection on plant defence in Arabidopsis thaliana 299
homogeneous environments in which either the strength of natural selection or mean fitness
is constant or similar across environments. However, as the spatial environment becomes
more varied and either the strength of selection within each environment or the mean fitness
in that environment becomes more heterogeneous, differences between hard and soft
selection become more pronounced. For example, the selection gradients for susceptibility
to AMD varied from −1.033 to 0.1257 in the fall, whereas the selection gradients all fell
within the range of −0.0595 to 0.3402 for basal branch number. Thus our finding that
differences between soft and hard selection are more pronounced for susceptibility to
AMD than for basal branch number is due in large part to the greater heterogeneity among
selection gradients for that trait.
Distinguishing between hard and soft selection statistically is likely to be a challenging
endeavour, whether done by bootstrapping (as we did) or by analytical methods. Given
spatial variation in estimates of selection, spatial variability in local fitness estimates is
the only factor that can produce differences in the point estimates of hard and soft selection
(i.e. equations 1 and 2 differ only by the weighting ratio). While such spatial variability
in local fitness estimates leads to greater differences in point estimates of hard and soft
selection, such variability might paradoxically reduce our ability to distinguish between
hard and soft selection statistically in many cases. When there is more spatial variability in
local fitness estimates, there will be more variability among individual bootstrap estimates
of hard and soft selection. One consequence of this is that the 95% confidence limits of
hard and soft selection estimates are likely to be larger and more likely to include each other.
Nevertheless, difficulty in ascribing a P-value to the difference between hard and soft
selection statistically does not imply that the distinction is not useful, nor that there is
no heuristic value to be gained by examining point estimates of hard and soft selection, and
how these change with different frequencies of selective environments.
Despite the theoretical importance of the distinction between hard and soft selection,
relatively few empirical studies have sought to evaluate whether qualitatively or quantita-
tively different outcomes are likely to be produced under a model of hard versus soft
selection. Our results suggest that soft selection typically has a greater absolute magnitude
than hard selection, which we hypothesize is due to selection on plant defence traits being
relaxed in favourable environments. It would be of interest to establish if this pattern is
consistent in studies of other traits, and in other systems in which spatial environments
are known to vary in a consistent manner (e.g. density of inter-specific competitors or
predators, nutrient or water availability, and so on). By measuring natural selection
on quantitative traits in multiple spatial environments and in multiple study systems, an
assessment of how frequently hard versus soft selection leads to different evolutionary
trajectories should be possible.
