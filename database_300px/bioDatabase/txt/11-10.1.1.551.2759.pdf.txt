ABSTRACT
Heterogeneity in the genome copy number of
tissues is of particular importance in solid tumor
biology. Furthermore, many clinical applications
such as pre-implantation and non-invasive prenatal
diagnosis would benefit from the ability to charac-
terize individual single cells. As the amount of DNA
from single cells is so small, several PCR protocols
have been developed in an attempt to achieve
unbiased amplification. Many of these approaches
are suitable for subsequent cytogenetic analyses
using conventional methodologies such as com-
parative genomic hybridization (CGH) to metaphase
spreads. However, attempts to harness array-CGH
for single-cell analysis to provide improved resolu-
tion have been disappointing. Here we describe a
strategy that combines single-cell amplification
using GenomePlex library technology (Genome-
Plex Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit,
Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and detailed analysis of geno-
mic copy number changes by high-resolution array-
CGH. We show that single copy changes as small as
8.3 Mb in single cells are detected reliably with
single cells derived from various tumor cell lines as
well as patients presenting with trisomy 21 and
Prader–Willi syndrome. Our results demonstrate the
potential of this technology for studies of tumor
biology and for clinical diagnostics.
INTRODUCTION
Clinical applications such as pre-implantation and non-
invasive prenatal diagnosis and studies of tumor heterogene-
ity and of single disseminated tumor cells (micrometastases)
require the analysis of genome copy number changes at
the single-cell level. Although this can be achieved using
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), resolution and
scope are severely limited and the procedure is time consum-
ing. Alternatively, the whole genome can be scanned for
changes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH),
but as insufficient DNA is available from single cells directly
for hybridization, PCR amplification protocols have been
investigated for this purpose. Initially, degenerate oligonu-
cleotide primed (DOP)-PCR (1) was used successfully by
various groups to analyze copy number changes in minute
subregions of specimens derived from, e.g. frozen tumor
sections, formalin fixed or paraffin-embedded materials (2–
5). However, the amplification of single cells compared with
several hundreds of cells from tissue sections is much more
demanding as unbiased amplification from such a small
amount of starting DNA has proved particularly challenging.
Protocols based on linker-adaptor PCR (6) or modified
DOP-PCR amplification (7,8) have been developed which
yield reproducible amplification products from single cells
suitable for subsequent CGH analysis onto metaphase spreads.
These methods have been applied to prenatal diagnostics
(9,10) and for the analyses of minimal residual disease (11,12).
However, amplification of single cells using these approaches
is labor-intensive and not amenable for high-throughput
applications. Recently, Le Caignec et al. (13) reported the
amplification of single lymphoblastoid cells, fibroblasts and
blastomeres by use of multiple displacement amplification
(MDA) and subsequent copy number analysis by array-CGH.
This approach was able to detect aneuploidies of whole chro-
mosomes, however, with a detection resolution of 34 Mb
at best, it failed to demonstrate a significant improvement
compared with conventional methodologies.
Here we describe a strategy combining single-cell amplifica-
tion by use of GenomePlex library technology (GenomePlex
Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit, Sigma-Aldrich,
UK) and genomic copy number analysis employing high-
resolution array-CGH (14). The GenomePlex library technol-
ogy allows a representative amplification of genomic DNA
based on random fragmentation and subsequent conversion
to PCR amplifiable products. Using this approach, we have

been able to detect copy number changes as small as 8.3 Mb in
microdissected tumor cells and cells derived from patients with
trisomy 21 and Prader–Willi sydrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient samples/cell lines
Genomic DNA derived from patients with trisomy 21 and
Prader–Willi Syndrome was isolated from peripheral blood
using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the instructions of the suppliers. The Chromo-
some 15q11–13 microdeletion was confirmed by FISH onto
metaphase spreads of the patient, using a commercially avail-
able FISH probe mapping to the SNRPN-gene (Abbott-Vysis).
The primary renal cell adenocarcinoma line (769P, ATCC
No. CRL-1933) and the colorectal cell line HCT116 (gener-
ously provided by Dr Christoph Lengauer and Dr Bert
Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore,
MD) were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium (Gibco Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 100 U/ml penicil-
lin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Genomic DNA was isolated
as described above.
The karyotype of HCT116 has previously been described
as 45, X–Y, der (10) dup (10) (q24q26)t(10;16)(q26;q24),
der (14) t(8;16)(q13;p13), der (15) t(17;18)(q21;p11.3) (15)
Preparation of cells on membrane-coated slides
Cell suspensions were prepared for microdissection by cen-
trifuging the cells for 10 min at 120 g. Pellets were washed
twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended
to obtain 2.5 · 106 cells/ml. 200 ml of the cell suspension
was then transferred by cytocentrifugation (120 g for
3 min) onto slides covered with a polyethylene-naphthalate
(PEN) membrane (PALM Microlaser Technologies, Bern-
ried, Germany).
Isolation of cells by laser microdissection
and pressure catapulting
Single cells were isolated using the PALM MicroBeam Sys-
tem (PALM Microlaser Technologies, Bernried, Germany) as
described previously (11,16,17) and collected in a 200 ml
Eppendorf tube cap containing 10 ml lysis and fragmentation
buffer as detailed below.
Single-cell amplification
Single-cell amplification was performed using the Gen-
omePlex Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK) according to the instructions of the sup-
pliers but with slight modification. Briefly, after catapulting
single cells into Eppendorf caps containing a mix of 1 ml
lysis and fragmentation buffer/proteinase K solution and
9 ml of water, individual cells were collected in separate
tubes by centrifugation for 10 min at 18 890 g. Cell lysis,
fragmentation and library preparation was performed accord-
ing to the instructions supplied in the kit. Amplification of the
library was performed as follows: 7.5 ml of 10· Amplification
Master Mix, 51 ml of nuclease free water and 1.5 ml Titanium
Taq DNA polymerase (BD Biosciences Clontech, Heidel-
berg, Germany) was added to 14 ml library mix. Samples
were amplified using an initial denaturation of 95C for
3 min followed by 23 cycles each consisting of a denaturation
step at 94C for 15 s and an annealing/extension step at 65C
for 5 min. The reaction mixture was stored at 20C until
further use.
Array-CGH
Whole genome tiling path arrays employed in this study were
prepared as described previously (14). The clone set used for
array construction was verified by fingerprinting and BAC
end sequencing, and can be viewed within the Ensembl gen-
ome browser (http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/
cytoview). Arrays were printed at the UCSF microarray facil-
ity (http://cc.ucsf.edu/microarray) and stored at room tem-
perature until use.
Array-CGH was performed as described previously with
slight modifications (14). Briefly, 200 ng of single-cell amp-
lification products and non-amplified genomic male reference
DNA were differentially labeled with dCTP-Cy3 or dCTP-
Cy5 (NEN Life Science Products) in a 150 ml reaction
using a Bioprime Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsberg, CA,
USA). All experiments were performed at least as duplicate,
color reversal hybridizations. Unincorporated nucleotides
were removed by use of Microcon YM-30 filter devices (Mil-
lipore Co.) according to the instructions of the suppliers.
Hybridizations were carried out by use of a Tecan HS
Hybridization Station (Tecan Group Ltd.). For hybridization
to an array of an area of 1.8 · 3.6 cm, Cy3 and Cy5 labeled
DNAs were combined, precipitated with 135 mg of human
Cot1 DNA (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, UK) and 33 mg of E.coli
genomic DNA (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) and resus-
pended in 120 ml of hybridization buffer (50% formamide,
5% dextran sulfate, 0.1% Tween-20, 2· SSC, 10 mM Tris–
Hcl, pH 7.4 and 10 mM cysteamine). Pre-hybridization solu-
tion was prepared simultaneously by precipitating 100 ml of
herring sperm DNA (10 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and
33 mg of E.coli genomic DNA (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France)
and resuspending in 165 ml of hybridization buffer.
The pre-hybridization and hybridization solutions were
then denatured for 10 min at 72C. Into the hybridization sta-
tion chamber, 100 ml of the pre-hybridization mix was then
injected following instructions displayed on the station. Dur-
ing pre-hybridization (45 min at 37C), the hybridization mix
was incubated at 37C. Hybridizations were carried out for
45 h at 37C with medium agitation frequency. Slides were
washed with PBS/0.05% Tween-20/2 mM cysteamine
(wash time 0.5 min, soak time 0.5 min, 15 cycles at 37C),
0.1· SSC (wash time 1.0 min, soak time 2.0 min, 5 cycles
at 54C), PBS/0.05% Tween 20/2 mM cysteamine (wash
time 0.5 min, soak time 0.5 min, 10 cycles at 23C) and
HPLC water (wash time 0.5 min, soak time 0.0 min,
1 cycle at 23C) before drying for 2.5 min using nitrogen gas.
Data analysis
The arrays were scanned using an Agilent scanner (Agilent
Technologies, UK) and images quantified by use of GenePix
version 6.0 software (GRI, UK). For each individual hybrid-
ization, the fluorescent ratios were normalized by dividing the
raw ratios of each clone by the median ratio of all autosomal
clones present on the array. Replicate experiments were

combined and data points were accepted if they were within
±10% of the median and if at least two accepted data points
remained. For comparison with Le Caignec et al. (13), a
subset of clones spaced at 1 Mb intervals across all chromo-
somes was selected from the full tile path set and this reduced
resolution analysis applied to hybridizations with the trisomy
21 and Prader–Willi cases. The clone selection was made by
simply identifying the clone mapping closest to the start of
each 1 Mb interval of each chromosome. The average clone
spacing of this subset was 1.03 Mb. For full tiling path anal-
ysis, the average ratio across 10 clones was calculated for
each chromosome and plotted against the midpoint position
of the 10 clones used for analysis. Each averaged data
point was then normalized further by dividing by the median
ratio of all autosomal averaged data points.
The estimate of experimental variability (SDe) was calcu-
lated using the 68.2th percentile value of absolute dye-swap
combined ratios as described in Fiegler et al. (14) for DNA
from the microdeletion and trisomy 21 cases. In a normal dis-
tribution, the area within ±1 SD from the mean contains
68.2% of all values. The 68.2th percentile value thus provides
an estimation of the standard deviation, which is relatively
insensitive to outlying values.
However, for DNA from tumor cell lines, copy number
changes (outliers) often make up >31.8% of ratio values
such that the 68.2% is no longer a good estimate of the vari-
ance of the central distribution. Therefore, for the two tumor
cell lines we used the 34.1% value which defines ±0.46 SD,
scaling this value accordingly. Significant gains and loses
were defined as regions of at least three consecutive data
points all above or all below 1.5 times the SDe.
Raw normalized ratios for all arrays, mean ratios across 10
tilepath clones and data for the 1 Mb selection can be found
in Supplementary data files 1, 2 and 3.
RESULTS
Three cells each of two different tumor cell lines and patients
with defined constitutional rearrangements were microdis-
sected, independently treated and amplified using the
GenomePlex library technology. The Single Cell WGA Kit
produced a consistent yield (between 3 and 6 mg) and size
range as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1).
The amplification products of each cell were then used for
analysis by high-resolution array-CGH. The array used in
this study consists of 26 574 clones selected from the pub-
lished Golden Path and covers 93.7% of euchromatic regions
in tiling path resolution. This array has been employed to sur-
vey copy number variations in the human genome and has
been subjected to high levels of validation (14,18). Hybridiza-
tions of single-cell amplifications generally showed an
increase in variation compared with corresponding non-
amplified DNA hybridizations. However, hybridizations were
consistent as the mean difference in the standard deviation
between duplicate dye-swap experiments (n ¼ 6) was <6%.
Hybridization with a renal cell carcinoma
cell line (769P)
To test whether single copy number changes of large regions
could be detected using single-cell array-CGH, we compared
hybridizations of single-cell amplification products and non-
amplified genomic DNA of a female renal cell carcinoma cell
line (769P). This cell line in our laboratory has been studied
extensively by M-FISH and array-CGH (14,19) and is prim-
arily tetraploid but with the equivalent of single copy gains
and losses (relative to diploid state) across the genome. In
general, areas of copy number change identified by hybridiza-
tion of non-amplified DNA could be detected with the single-
cell products. Chromosome 1, e.g. harbors the equivalent of a
single copy deletion on the p-arm covering a region of
30 Mb and the equivalent of a single copy gain on the q-
arm of 90 Mb. Both regions of copy number change were
identified in single-cell amplified material and non-amplified
DNA (Figure 2). Mean ratios across these regions on Chro-
mosome 1 compared well between the two applications,
however, standard deviations were generally increased when
hybridizing single-cell amplification products (Table 1).
Moreover, standard deviations across all autosomes were sig-
nificantly increased when hybridizing amplified single-cell
material [SDe (single-cell products): 0.24 (Cell 1), 0.27
(Cell 2) and 0.22 (Cell 3), SDe (non-amplified DNA):0.07].
Hybridization with HCT116
Hybridization of a colorectal tumor cell line, HCT 116, pro-
duced similar observations. Experimental variability (SDe)
was 0.18 (Cell 1), 0.19 (Cell 2) and 0.26 (Cell 3) across the
autosomes for single cells, compared with 0.05 for non-
amplified genomic DNA. Moreover, we identified small
differences between amplified single-cell DNA and non-
amplified genomic DNA and within single-cell amplifications.
For example, we identified a 8.3 Mb single copy deletion on
Chromosome 3 (genomic position 0.7–9.0 Mb) followed by
a gain of 9.2 Mb (genomic position 18.4–27.6 Mb) in one
out of the three cells analyzed, which was also not present
in non-amplified DNA (Figure 3).

able for the types of analyses required for prenatal diagnostic

tests, we hybridized amplified single-cell material derived
from a female patient diagnosed with trisomy 21 and a
male patient with an established microdeletion (Prader–
Willi syndrome) both against non-amplified male control
DNA. CGH analysis using single-cell amplification products
of the trisomy 21 patient revealed a ratio increase affecting
nearly all Chromosome 21 data points in all three cells ana-
lyzed, with 22/28 data points (Cell 1), 23/28 data points (Cell
2) and 19/28 data points (Cell 3) reporting the trisomy
(Figure 4A–C). Additional small regions of gain or loss
were reported on various other chromosomes. Unfortunately,
we could not obtain genomic DNA from this patient for
comparison and so cannot confirm these observations in
non-amplified DNA.
This same data set was reanalyzed at a simulated resolution
of 1 clone per Mb for comparison with the study of
Le Caignec et al. (13). While all Chromosome 21 data points
showed an increased ratio, due to the higher level of varia-
tion, fewer data points were called according to our criteria

for significant regions of gain of loss (Figure 4 D–F). How-
ever, using the same whole chromosome averaging approach
as Le Caignec et al. (13) with a threshold for significance set
at ±3 times the standard deviation of all autosomes excluding
Chromosome 21, the trisomy 21 was easily detected. For each
of the three cells, only Chromosme 21 showed a significant
copy number change (Figure 5). Overall, the variance of
the chromosome averages for data from our simulated 1 Mb
resolution analysis was lower than the equivalent data from
Le Caignec et al. (13) (Table 2). For example, the mean
Chromosome 21 ratio for the three cells was 0.49 for the
Le Caignec et al. study and 0.48 in this study but the standard
deviations of the means were 0.11 and 0.07 respectively.
Similarly, the standard deviation of autosome means (exclud-
ing Chromosome 21) for all cells was 0.13 for the Le Caignec
et al. study and 0.08 in this study.
For a patient with Prader–Willi syndrome, array-CGH
analysis confirmed a microdeletion, previously identified
using a single FISH probe on Chromosome 15, with a size
of 10.8 Mb (Figure 6A–D). This deleted region was called
in non-amplified DNA (genomic position 20.0–30.8 Mb
involving 11 data points) and Cells 1 (genomic position
18.8–30.8 Mb involving 12 data points), 2 and 3 (genomic
position 20.0–30.0 Mb involving 10 data points).
Again, hybridizations with single-cell amplification prod-
ucts were noisier [SDe of 0.14 (Cell 1), 0.17 (Cell 2) and
0.14 (Cell 3)] than the equivalent hybridization with non-
amplified DNA (SDe ¼ 0.03). With the exception of three
small regions of reported copy number loss on Chromosomes
1, 11 and 20 detected in two of the three cells analyzed, none
of the additional copy number changes were reported in the
three hybridizations using single-cell products [12 regions
involving 50 data points (Cell 1), 17 regions involving
59 data points (Cell 2) and 20 regions involving 70 data
points (Cell 3)] could be verified in the control hybridization
producing a false positive rate of 2.0 (Cell 1), 2.4 (Cell 2) and
2.8% (Cell 3). Conversely, when applying the same threshold
parameters for the control hybridization using non-amplified
genomic DNA, 23 additional regions involving 75 data points
reported small but significant copy number changes which
were not detected in the single-cell amplifications, producing
a false negative rate of 3.0%.
Reanalysis of Chromosome 15 with the simulated 1 Mb
resolution clone set showed further increase in variation par-
ticularly for the non-deleted region (Figure 6 and Table 3).
Furthermore, although the deletion involving the expected
region was observed in all three cells, using the 1 Mb data
set fewer and a more variable number of clones reported

DISCUSSION
The detection of copy number changes in single cells is of
great importance for many clinical applications, in particular
pre-implantation and non-invasive prenatal diagnosis as well
as studies of tumor heterogeneity and micrometastasis. Nev-
ertheless, the unbiased amplification of the small amounts of
DNA available from single cells has proved particularly chal-
lenging. Recently, Hu et al., (20) have used a DOP-PCR
approach to amplify single lymphocytes and fibroblast cells
for subsequent detection of chromosome aneuploidies by
low resolution (whole chromosome) array-CGH. Although
they were able to detect known whole chromosome trisomies,
replicate control experiments using normal male or female
single lymphocytes were highly variable such that false chro-
mosome aneuploidies were found in many experiments.
Le Caignec et al. (13) described a strategy that combined
multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and array-CGH
to determine aneuploidy levels in single lymphoblastoid
cells, fibroblasts and blastomeres. Although this group used
an array with a resolution of 1 clone every Mb across the
genome, for the analysis of trisomy, clone ratios were aver-
aged across whole chromosomes. In single trisomy 13, 18
and 21 fibroblasts, mean log2 ratios of the affected chromo-
somes were found to be 0.58, 0.55 and 0.49, respectively
(theoretical ratio for trisomy ¼ 0.58), while mean ratios of
the unaffected chromosomes in general were close to zero.
Although this approach appears to be more reproducible
than the previous study, replicate experiments still showed
a high degree of variability requiring smoothing or averaging
of data points. While Le Caignec et al. (13) demonstrated that
a deletion of 34 Mb could be detected by averaging all of the
39 clones within this previously identified region, they did
not investigate the minimum level of smoothing required
for reliable detection of copy number changes and so the
absolute resolution of their strategy for detecting unknown
copy number changes.
We have employed the GenomePlex library technology
(GenomePlex Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification
Kit, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) for amplification of microdissected
single cells derived from tumor cell lines and patients with
constitutional rearrangements and characterized genomic
copy number changes by high-resolution array-CGH. The
detection of chromosome aneuploidies was tested by analyzing

single-cell material derived from a patient presenting with tri-
somy 21. We found that the vast majority of data points
(average of 10 clones equivalent to 1 Mb) representing
Chromosome 21 showed a single copy gain in all three
individually treated cells. However, we too found increased
variability associated with single-cell amplification compared
with non-amplified genomic DNA. This variability as well as
potential differences in DNA representation in amplifications
may well account for the small number of the data points that
did not reach the significance threshold. For comparison of
our results with the study of Le Caignec et al. (13) we calcu-
lated the mean ratios across the chromosomes for all three
cells (Table 2) using the simulated 1 clone per Mb data set.
Although mean ratios of the non-affected autosomes were
found to be similarly 0, Chromosome 21 clones reported
mean ratios of 0.46, 0.56 and 0.42 for the three cells which
compares well with the results obtained by Le Caignec
et al. who reported mean ratios of 0.38, 0.50 and 0.59, respec-
tively. However, in general our results were less variable with
a mean and SD of 0.01 ± 0.08 for the other autosomes com-
pared with 0.04 ± 0.13 for the study of Le Caignec et al. This
would suggest that the amplification method we have used
produces less variable results than the MDA method used
by Le Caignec et al. although these small differences could
also be explained by the use of different arrays and hybridiza-
tion protocols. However, the most dramatic improvement in
our results is due to the possibility to maintain a 1 Mb resolu-
tion while smoothing the data by averaging 10 tiling path
clones (Table 2, Figure 4).
With the development of high-resolution array-CGH, the
detection of microdeletions and microduplications in patients
with constitutional rearrangements as well as prenatal detec-
tion of well characterized microdeletion/microduplication
syndromes has become a widespread application for this
technique. We were curious to see whether our single cell
approach would be suited to identify reliably such small
copy number changes across the genome. We, therefore, ana-
lyzed single-cell material derived from a male patient present-
ing with Prader–Willi syndrome and compared the results with
hybridizations using non-amplified control DNA. An unusu-
ally large single copy deletion on Chromosome 15, which
had previously been confirmed using a commercially available
FISH probe, was detected in all three single cells as well as in
the control DNA and could be sized 10.8 Mb. The size of
this deletion is unusual as patients with Prader–Willi syn-
drome usually have a deletion of 4 Mb (21). Chromosome
analysis excluded the presence of a complex chromosomal
rearrangement and confirmed the presence of an interstitial
deletion (data not shown). However, we also tested DNA
from a patient with DiGeorge syndrome with a deletion of
3 Mb, which was not detected in single-cell amplifications
(data not shown). This result is not unexpected as the variabil-
ity of the single-cell amplifications necessitated smoothing of
the data by averaging 10 clones and requiring three data points
to exceed the threshold, which reduces the resolution of our
strategy to 3 Mb. The DiGeorge region is also rich in seg-
mental duplications which are known to reduce the response
of clones to specific copy number changes.

To test the detection limitations of our approach further,
we then analyzed two different, previously well characterized
tumor cell lines which are known to harbor various single
copy number changes of different sizes. For example, the
renal carcinoma cell line, 769P, harbors the equivalent of a
single copy number loss of 30 Mb on Chromosome
1p and a single copy number gain of 90 Mb on Chromo-
some 1q, both of which were readily detected by our meth-
odology. However, 769P also has a small single copy
deletion on Chromosome 9 of 6.3 Mb (genomic position
16.7–23.0 Mb), which due to our stringent calling parameters
was only called partially in one of the three single cells ana-
lyzed, although lower ratios consistent with a deletion of this
region could be seen in the other two single cells (Figure 7).
We are thus able to conclude that the resolution of our strat-
egy to detect single copy deletions in single cells is at least
10.8 Mb but not as low as 6.3 Mb.
It is well known that heterogeneity in the genomic consti-
tution of cells within solid tumors is an important feature in
the natural history of tumor progression and metastasis.
Accessing the exact copy number status of individual cells
or localized groups of cells within tumors has been technically
challenging. We identified copy number differences between
individual single cells of both tumor cell lines we studied.
For example, when analyzing the amplification products
derived from single HCT116 cells, we identified a 8.3 Mb
single copy deletion on Chromosome 3 (genomic position
0.7–9.0 Mb) followed by a gain of 9.2 Mb (18.4–27.6 Mb)

in one out of the three cells analyzed. HCT116 is a colorectal
cell line, which has often been used because of its stable kary-
otype. Our single-cell array-CGH observation of an imbalance
on Chromosome 3 may, therefore, represent merely a rare
finding. Alternatively, it may suggest that small rearrange-
ments below the detection limits of conventional cytogenetics
may be a common occurrence. A large series of array-CGH
experiments with single HCT116 cells could clarify which
of the two options is correct; however, this would be beyond
the scope of this study.
It should be noted, however, that some of the differences in
copy number between single-cell amplifications, at least for
dividing cells, may be due to the position of each cell within
the cell cycle. Cells which are harvested within S phase will
have a proportion of their genome replicated and so increased
in copy number when compared with cells in G1 phase. It
might be predicted that cells harvested during S phase
would show higher overall variability and, therefore, noisier
hybridizations which will reduce the ability to detect smaller
copy number changes.
We would expect the methods described here to be equally
applicable to cells microdissected from frozen sections. How-
ever, we do not yet have experience with paraffin-embedded
tissue but it is likely that variability of the ratio profiles may
be further increased in such histological preparations.
In conclusion, we have shown that by utilizing GenomePlex
library technology for the amplification of single cells with
high-resolution large insert clone array-CGH we can not
only identify with confidence whole chromosome trisomies,
but also detect copy number changes as small as 8.3 Mb. In
this way, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of single-
cell array-CGH to identify previously undetected microdele-
tions and microduplications and the potential for application
to non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (by the analysis of fetal
cells in the maternal circulation) and tumor heterogeneity.
