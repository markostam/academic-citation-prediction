ABSTRACT
Rev1 is a deoxycytidyl transferase associated
with DNA translesion synthesis (TLS). In addition
to its catalytic domain, Rev1 possesses a so-called
BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain. Here, we
describe cells and mice containing a targeted deletion
of this domain. Rev1B/B mice are healthy, fertile and
display normal somatic hypermutation. Rev1B/B cells
display an elevated spontaneous frequency of intra-
genic deletions at Hprt. In addition, these cells were
sensitized to exogenous DNA damages. Ultraviolet-C
(UV-C) light induced a delayed progression through
late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and many
chromatid aberrations, specifically in a subset of
mutant cells, but not enhanced sister chromatid
exchanges (SCE). UV-C-induced mutagenesis was
reduced and mutations at thymidine–thymidine
dimers were absent in Rev1B/B cells, the opposite
phenotype of UV-C-exposed cells from XP-V patients,
lacking TLS polymerase h. This suggests that the
enhanced UV-induced mutagenesis in XP-V patients
may depend on error-prone Rev1-dependent TLS.
Together, these data indicate a regulatory role of
the Rev1 BRCT domain in TLS of a limited spectrum
of endogenous and exogenous nucleotide damages
during a defined phase of the cell cycle.
INTRODUCTION
Completion of DNA replication prior to mitosis is a critical
phase in the cell cycle of eukaryotic cells. Blockage of the
replication machinery by unrepaired DNA nucleotide damage,
induced by endogenous or exogenous genotoxic agents, could
result in the collapse of replication forks that may lead to
DNA breaks and cellular lethality, when not properly resolved.
To avert a replicational catastrophe, the cells are equipped
with pathways that act to continue replication in the presence
of persistent DNA damage (1). Whereas recombination-
mediated DNA damage avoidance (DA) pathways are
associated with an error-free replicational bypass of DNA
lesions using the undamaged sister chromatid as a template,
error-prone bypass is executed by TLS, which is characterized
by the insertion of a nucleotide across the damaged nucleotide,
followed by the subsequent resumption of replication. TLS
is believed to be the major source of DNA damage-induced
point mutations, underlying pathological processes like tumor-
igenesis but presumably also the physiological process of
somatic hypermutation (SHM), a highly mutagenic process
required for the somatic evolution of high affinity antibodies,
occurring in antigen-stimulated B cells (2).
Most TLS polymerases belong to the conserved Y-family of
DNA polymerases, including Escherichia coli polymerases IV
and V, as well as the eukaryotic Rev1 protein and DNA poly-
merases pol h, pol i, and pol k (3). DNA polymerases from the
Y-family are distributive and are able to replicate a variety of
DNA template lesions in vitro, at the expense of a high rate of
misincorporations, depending on the type of DNA lesion and
the polymerase involved. Orthologs of Rev1 were identified in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, chicken,
mouse and man (3,4). In vitro, Rev1 proteins possess a unique
template-dependent deoxycytidyl transferase activity opposite
structurally diverse nucleotide damages, including abasic sites
and uracil residues (5–11). Although in S.cerevisiae, REV1 is
essential for the bypass of abasic sites also in vivo, its catalytic
domain may be dispensable for this process (12,13), indicating
an additional regulatory or structural role for the protein.
Although in vivo TLS of UV-induced photoproducts requires
REV1 (14), the protein does not incorporate a deoxycytosine
opposite dipyrimidine photoproducts in vitro (11) and in vivo
(15,16) in further support of such a catalysis-independent role.
In agreement with an important regulatory role of the Rev1
protein in TLS also in vertebrates, Rev1-deficient chicken
DT40 cells display reduced viability and are sensitive to a

wide range of DNA-damaging agents (4). ‘Knock down’
of REV1 mRNA in human cells results in a hypomutable
phenotype after UV treatment (17,18).
The presence of an N-terminal BRCT domain discriminates
Rev1 from the other members of Y family of DNA poly-
merases (19). BRCT domains have been identified in several
proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and
DNA metabolism (20,21). BRCT domains were shown to bind
proteins that are phosphorylated by DNA damage-activated
protein kinases ATR and ATM, supportive of the involvement
of these domains in regulating cellular DNA damage responses
(22–24). The hypomutability of a S.cerevisiae mutant, con-
taining an amino acid change in the REV1 BRCT domain, by
short-wave UV-C-light, ionizing radiation, and 4-nitroquino-
line 1-oxide (4-NQO) supports a regulatory role for the REV1
BRCT domain in the cellular response to exogenous DNA
damage in yeast (14,25–27).
To investigate a role for the Rev1 BRCT domain in regu-
lating DNA damage responses in mammalian cells, we have
generated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and mice with a
targeted deletion in the Rev1 BRCT domain. These Rev1B/B
ES cells show normal viability and are slightly sensitive to
genotoxic agents. Rev1B/B mice were born in a Mendelian
ratio, were normally fertile and did not display an obvious
phenotype. Spontaneously occurring Hprt mutants in Rev1B/B
ES cells contained predominantly gene deletions rather than
base pair substitutions. Following exposure to UV-C light,
Rev1B/B ES cells showed prolonged late S and G2 phases,
induction of multiple chromatid breaks in a small subset of
cells and a reduced frequency of Hprt mutants. This was
accompanied by a complete loss of induced mutations at
thymidine–thymidine (TT) dimer sites, implicating a role of
the Rev1 BRCT domain in regulating TLS of photoproducts at
these sites. SHM in the mutant mice was normal, indicating
that the Rev1 BRCT domain is dispensable for TLS of abasic
and uracil residues. Taken together, these results demonstrate
a regulatory role for the BRCT domain of mammalian
Rev1 in the mutagenic bypass of spontaneous and induced
DNA lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene targeting at Rev1
Genomic clones of the mouse Rev1 gene were isolated from a
129/SvEv PAC genomic library (Research Genetics). Gene
targeting vectors pBRCT–hygro and pBRCT–puro, aimed at
deleting of one or both alleles of the Rev1 BRCT domain were
generated by replacing a 3 kb genomic fragment encoding
exons 2 and 3 with pPGK–hygromycin, and pPGK–puromycin
cassettes, respectively. A pPGK–TK cassette was introduced
flanking the short arms of each vector, to enable counter
selection with ganciclovir. The resulting Rev1 alleles
were called Rev1B (hyg) and Rev1B ( pur). Targeting vector
pREV1–loxP was generated by introducing a cassette contain-
ing pPGK–neo and pPGK–TK, flanked by loxP sites between
exons 3 and 4, as well as an additional loxP site 50 of exon 2
(Figure 1D). This construct aimed at generating an exon 2 and
3-deleted Rev1 allele in the absence of intervening marker
sequences (the Rev1L allele), as well as at reverting the
Rev1B (hyg) allele to wild type, resulting in the Rev1L+ allele.
Site-specific recombination between loxP sites by introduction
of the Cre recombinase, was performed as described (28).
Culture, electroporation, selection and counter selection of
subline IB10 of the 129/OLA-derived ES cell line E14 was
performed according to established procedures.
Identification of targeted recombinants
To analyze ES cell clones electroporated with pBRCT–hygro
and pBRCT–puro, Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham
Pharmacia) of blotted agarose gels with KpnI-digested DNA
were hybridized with a probe externally to the left arm of
the targeting vector (probe A, Figure 1C). Membranes with
BglII-digested DNA were hybridized with a probe externally
to the right arm of the targeting vector (probe B, Figure 1C).
Targeting with pRev1–loxP was analyzed as follows: BclI-
digested DNA was hybridized with a probe A, BglII-digested
DNA with probe B.
Rev1 antibody preparation and immunoblotting
A DNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 772–1249 (the
C-terminus) of mouse Rev1 was cloned in pET30 (Novagen)
and expressed in E.coli. Rev1-containing inclusion bodies
were isolated, washed with 4 M urea and used to immunize
rabbits (Eurogentec). The resulting polyclonal antisera were
affinity purified using the Rev1 protein fragment, excised from
an immunoblot of a preparative polyacrylamide gel (29).
For the immunological detection of Rev1, cells were lysed
in RIPA buffer (30). Cellular proteins were separated by 6%
SDS–PAGE followed by a transfer to PVDF membranes
(Millipore). Incubation with affinity-purified Rev1 antibody
and subsequent incubation with goat-anti rabbit-peroxidase
secondary antibody (BioRad) was followed by an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection (ECL+), according to the man-
ufacturer’s recommendations (Amersham Biosciences).
RNA isolation and RT–PCR
Total RNA was isolated from ES cells using an RNeasy kit
(Qiagen). Mouse Rev1 cDNA was generated using Super-
script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligonucleo-
tide primer p15 (50-GCTGGAAGGGCAATTACACT-30) that
anneals at 3034–3015 nt downstream of the putative
translational start codon. Primers p17 (50-AGAACGGAGA-
ATGATGGC-30) and pGFP2 (50-GGCCCAGGATCCTCAG-
GTTTGCACACAGG-30) were used to amplify a reaction
product of 439 bp encompassing 25–464 nt from the transla-
tional start codon, containing exons 2–5 (partially). Primers
p20 (50-GTTGCATGGAGGTCAATACC-30) and pTH2
(50-AATACTGCCATTCCAG-30) gave a reaction product of
1176 bp, representing 226–1402 nt downstream of the putative
start codon, containing exons 4–8 (partially).
Exposure to genotoxic agents, cell cycle and cytogenetic
analysis, clonal survival assays and Hprt mutagenesis
Methylnitrosourea (MNU) treatment: cells were exposed to
MNU in medium without fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37C
for 60 min. Cells were washed once with ES culture medium.
4-NQO treatment: cells were exposed to 4-NQO (Sigma-
Aldrich) in medium lacking FCS, at 37C for 60 min. Cells
were washed once with ES culture medium. UV-C treatment
(Philips T.U.V. lamp, predominantly 254 nm) was performed
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 1 357
under a thin layer of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fresh
medium was added after UV-C treatment.
For cell cycle analysis, the cells were seeded at a density of
either 1.5 · 106 (untreated control) or 3 · 106 cells (treated
cells) per 90 mm gelatin-coated culture dish and grown in a
complete medium, containing 50% buffalo rat liver (BRL)
cell-conditioned complete medium, 15 h before treatment
with UV-C. At various time points after treatment, cells
were collected by scraping and subsequently washed twice
with cold PBS (4C) and fixed in 70% cold ethanol. After
removal of the fixative, cells were suspended in 500 ml of
PBS containing propidium iodide (PI, 33 mg/ml). Cell cycle
profiles were generated using a FACSCAN apparatus (Becton
Dickinson) and analyzed using ModFit LT software (Verity
Software House).
For cytogenetic analysis, cells were treated with UV-C as
above. After treatment, the cells were cultured in medium
supplemented with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 5 mM) for
24–32 h. Colcemid (0.1 mg/ml) was added to the medium
2 h before the cells were collected and washed in 75 mM
KCl at room temperature. Cells were fixed in methanol:acetic
acid (3:1). Metaphase spreads were stained according to the
FPG technique (31).
Clonal survival and induction of mutations at the Hprt gene
were determined as described previously (32).
Mutational spectra analysis of Hprt gene mutations from
independently derived mutant clones was performed as
described previously (33). Briefly, mouse Hprt cDNA was
generated from total RNA of 6-thioguanine-resistant cell
clones using the Hprt-specific primer hprt–cDNA (50-GCAG-
CAACTGACATTTCTAAAAATAAA-30). For some experi-
ments, an internal control mouse Aprt cDNA was synthesized
using an Aprt-specific primer sus2 (50-GGGGTGTGAC-
CATCTAGCCAG-30). After an initial denaturation step of
10 min at 94C, cDNA was amplified in a PCR reaction of
34 cycles (30 s at 94C, 30 s at 55C and 90 s at 72C) using
HotGoldstar Taq polymerase (Eurogentec) and Hprt-specific
primers hprt-mus1 and san2m13 (33), as well as Aprt-specific
primers sus3 (50-GTCTTCCCCGACTTCCCAAT-30) and
sus4 (50-GCCAGGAGGTCATCCACAAT-30), under conditions

cDNA was subjected to automatic DNA sequence analysis
(Applied Biosystems).
Generation of Rev1 BRCT-mutant mice and
SHM analysis
Two independently derived Rev1+/B ES cell clones were
injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric male
mice that were crossed to C57Bl/6 females. To determine the
germ-line transmission of the mutated allele, tail DNA was
genotyped in a multiplex PCR reaction using Taq polymerase
(Gibco) (35 cycles at 94C for 60 s, 53C for 60 s, and 72C
for 90 s), using primers BRCTKA1 (50-CAATGATAGCC-
CAACTTGTG-30) and BRCTKA3 (50-ACTGAGTCACACT-
AGCCACG-30) to identify the wild-type allele and primers
BRCTKA1 and PGKJ1 (50-GCTCATTCCTCCCACTCATG-
30) to identify the mutant allele. F2 heterozygous Rev1B/B mice
were interbred to obtain homozygously mutant animals.
Somatic hypermutation in memory B cells of non-immunized
mice was determined as described previously (34).
RESULTS
Generation and characterization of
Rev1 BRCT-mutant ES cells
To study the role of the BRCT domain of mouse Rev1 in
mutagenesis and genome maintenance, ES cells containing
a targeted deletion of the BRCT domain were generated.
Exons encoding this part of the Rev1 protein were mapped
(Figure 1A). Gene-targeting vectors pBRCT–hygro and
pBRCT–puro (Figure 1B) were constructed to delete exons
2 and 3 from both alleles, coding for the N-terminal 60 amino
acids of the protein, including conserved residues (10,21). One
Rev1+/B (hyg) clone was used in a second round of gene
targeting with pBRCT–puro (Figure 1B). Two resulting
Rev1B/B (hyg, pur) ES cell clones, named Rev1B/B-254 and
Rev1B/B-243, were used for the experiments described below.
To confirm that the phenotype of Rev1B/B cell lines was not
affected by the intervening hygromycin and puromycin cas-
settes, we have generated an independent ES cell line carrying
the biallelic exon 2 and 3 deletion in the absence of a marker
gene in one of both Rev1 alleles. This line was called Rev1L/B.
To confirm that the phenotype of Rev1B/B ES cells is caused
by the targeted Rev1 deletion, the Rev1B (hyg) allele of
Rev1B/B-254 ES cells was reverted to wild type, resulting in
Rev1-heterozygous control ES cell line Rev1L+/B (Figure 1D
and E). Clones from all gene-targeting experiments were ana-
lyzed with external probes A (Figure 1C and E) and B (data not
shown).
We investigated the expression of Rev1 in the Rev1B/B-
254 ES cell line by RT–PCR. The results of this experiment
indicated that Rev1B/B ES cells produce Rev1 transcripts only
lacking the sequences encoded by exons 2 and 3 that have been
deleted from the genome (Figure 2A). Western blot analysis of
cell lysates using an antiserum raised against a C-terminal
Rev1 fragment showed the presence of Rev1 protein with a
slightly reduced molecular mass in the Rev1B/B and Rev1L/B
mutants (Figure 2B). As judged by the similar expression in
the Rev1B/B and Rev1L/B lines, the presence of the intervening
marker in the Rev1B/B line did not affect the expression of the
truncated protein. A similarly shortened protein was detected
in cells transfected with a Rev1 cDNA expression construct
carrying a 50 deletion of 123 bp (including the translational
start codon; data not shown). Thus, Rev1B/B ES cells express
N-terminally truncated Rev1, most probably initiating within
exon 4 at one, or both, of two downstream ATG codons at
positions 211 and 214 (position 1 is at the adenine of the
putative start codon ATG in exon 2). The protein lacks
most of the BRCT domain and has the predicted molecular
mass of 129 kDa (versus 137 kDa for the full-length protein).
Increased DNA damaging sensitivity and specific defect
in cell cycle progression of Rev1 BRCT-mutant
ES cells
All ES cell lines generated in this study display wild-type
growth and cloning efficiency (data not shown). Thus, the Rev1
BRCT domain is dispensable for normal cellular viability or
growth. Clonal survival of Rev1B/B and wild-type ES cells
was determined following exposure to different types of muta-
gens: short-wave UV-C light, inducing cyclobutane- and
pyrimidine–pyrimidone dimers at adjacent pyrimidines
(CPD and 6-4 PP, respectively); 4-NQO, predominantly gen-
erating adducts at guanines (35) and MNU, an agent that
induces a variety of methylated nucleotides (36). Rev1B/B
ES cells display a small but reproducible increased sensitivity
to all agents (Figure 3).
To provide further evidence for a role of the BRCT domain
in response to DNA damage, we investigated the progress
through the S phase of the cell cycle in UV-C-damaged mutant
and wild-type cells. In all untreated ES cell lines, 70% of
cells were in S phase and 15% of the cells were in either G1
or G2 phases; there was no difference in the cell cycle pro-
gression between wild-type and mutant cell lines (Figure 4B).
Following exposure to 1 J/m2 of UV-C, the Rev1B/B and
Rev1L/B cells displayed a persistent accumulation specifically
in late S and in G2 phases, when compared with the wild-type
and the heterozygous Rev1+/B and Rev1L+/B lines (Figure 4A
and B). Since early- and mid-S phases are unaffected in the
mutant, the function of the BRCT domain of Rev1 is probably
restricted to the late S phase.

UV-C exposure of Rev1 BRCT-mutant cells induces
many chromatid aberrations in a small subset of
cells, without concomitant SCE
Arrested replication forks at sites of DNA damage may be
rescued either by TLS or by error-free DA, which depends on
the annealing of the arrested strand to the sister chromatid that
subsequently acts as a template for DNA synthesis. Defects in
TLS might result either in the enhancement of this template
switching or in collapsed replication forks if template switch-
ing is not possible. The latter can result in a double-stranded
DNA break (DSB) and consequent chromatid breaks, if the
DSB is not properly repaired by homology-mediated DSB
repair or by end-joining (37,38). To investigate the involve-
ment of the Rev1 BRCT domain in TLS and a possible
redundancy between TLS and DA, we measured the induction
of chromatid breaks as well as SCE as an indication of both
template switching and homology-mediated DSB repair. The
induction of chromatid breaks and aberrations was studied in
metaphase spreads of two Rev1B/B lines and wild-type ES
cells. After UV-C exposure, nascent DNA was labeled
with BrdU, enabling the specific selection of cells that had
undergone one complete S phase after treatment for analysis
of chromatid aberrations. In mutant cells, the time to com-
plete one cell cycle was significantly extended, as judged by
the reduced fraction of cells in the second cycle at 28 h after
UV-C treatment (Table 1). This is probably caused by their
accumulation at the late S- and G2 phases. To allow the
comparison of chromatid aberrations in both genotypes,
Rev1B/B cells were analyzed for chromatid aberrations at
32 h after UV-C treatment and wild-type cells at 28 h, at
which time point, similar fractions of each cell line had
undergone one complete replication cycle. After UV-C treat-
ment, both tested Rev1B/B ES cell lines displayed a moderate
(from 25 to 35% of all cells) increase in the number of cells
with a low number of chromatid breaks and aberrations, when
compared with wild-type ES cells (Table 1). More striking
was the strong increase (from 3% to 13% of all cells) in the
number of cells displaying many chromatid abnormalities
(resulting from more than six breaks, Table 1 and Figure 5)
and the increased number of aberrations in this subset of cells.
Since most of the cells were in S phase during UV-C-
irradiation, the limited number of cells with heavily damaged
genomes again points to a temporally restricted role of the
BRCT domain of Rev1 in the resolution of replication arrests
by TLS.
We analyzed second-division cells from the same experi-
ment for the presence of SCE. The number of SCE in untreated
cells was indistinguishable between untreated wild-type and
mutant cells. Although after UV-C exposure the number of
SCE per metaphase was increased in cells of both genotypes,
no significant difference in the level of SCE induction was
found between the wild-type and mutant cell lines tested
(Table 2).

Involvement of the Rev1 BRCT domain in spontaneous
and DNA damage-induced mutagenesis
To investigate whether the Rev1 BRCT domain is involved
in the TLS of endogenous DNA damage, we analyzed the
spontaneous mutagenesis at Hprt in Rev1B/B cell lines.
Although no significant differences in the spontaneous mutant
frequency were found between the different cell lines
(Figure 6), analysis of RT–PCR products of Hprt mRNA
from the spontaneous mutants revealed clear differences

between mutant and wild-type cell lines. Thus, we were able to
obtain Hprt cDNA from only 37% of the mutants (9/24),
although Aprt was readily amplified from all the mutants in
a multiplex RT–PCR reaction with Hprt (data not shown). This
is in contrast with wild-type cells where we obtained Hprt RT–
PCR product in 70% of all spontaneous Hprt-mutant clones.
Limited analysis of genomic deletions by performing PCR of
Hprt exons 3, 7 and 8 in the spontaneous Hprt mutants
revealed the presence of deletions in one or more of these
exons in 33% of all spontaneous Rev1B/B Hprt mutants, as
opposed to 20% of the wild-type Hprt mutants. In agreement,
substitution mutations and single nucleotide frameshifts,
indicative of TLS events, were found in only 13% of the
Rev1B/B Hprt mutant clones when compared with 40% of
the wild-type clones.
To examine the role of the BRCT domain of Rev1 in
mutagenesis induced by exogenous DNA damage, various
mutant and wild-type ES cell lines were exposed to UV-C
light followed by determination of mutant frequencies at
Hprt. All homozygous Rev1 BRCT mutant ES cell lines
that were generated in this study showed an approximately
3-fold reduction in the UV-C-induced Hprt mutant frequency
when compared with the Rev1-proficient cell lines tested
(Figure 6; data not shown). Of note, Rev1L/B cells, containing
the BRCT deletion in one Rev1 allele in the absence of a
marker gene, behaved similarly to the other Rev1B/B cell
lines (data not shown), validating the phenotype. We further
investigated the involvement of the Rev1 BRCT domain in the
bypass of UV-C-induced pyrimidine dimers by performing a
mutational spectra analysis of independent Hprt mutants from
wild-type ES cells and from Rev1B/B ES cells, exposed to
2 J/m2 of UV-C (Table 3; Supplementary Table). The fraction
of base pair substitutions at dipyrimidine sites in the non-
transcribed strand, as opposed to the transcribed strand
appeared slightly, but not significantly, higher in wild-type
cells (49%) than in the Rev1B/B ES cells (35%). Although GC
to AT transitions at dipyrimidine sites dominated the single
base pair substitutions in both cell populations, there are no
transversions found in the Rev1-mutant line. Moreover, no
single base pair substitutions at TT dipyrimidine sites were
found in UV-C-exposed Rev1B/B ES cells, in contrast to wild-
type cells, in which 24% of the base pair substitutions were
localized at TT sites (Table 3; Supplementary Table). This
result is statistically significant (P < 0.02, c2 test) and indi-
cates that in vivo UV photoproducts at TT dimers are specific
substrates for the error-prone TLS mediated by the BRCT
domain of Rev1.
SHM is normal in Rev1 BRCT-mutant mice
Two independent Rev1+/B ES cell clones were used to generate
chimeric mice. Both clones yielded germ line transmission
of the mutated allele. After intercrossing of the heterozygous
F2, homozygous Rev1B/B offspring was obtained in normal
Mendelian ratios: 53 wild-type, 110 heterozygous and
50 homozygous offsprings. Rev1B/B mice were healthy, dis-
played no overt abnormalities and had no obvious pathology
(the oldest mice were 19-months-old, the median age was
14 months). In addition, both male and female Rev1B/B
mice displayed normal fertility; offspring of these mice,
crossed to Rev1+/B mice segregated according to Mendel.

Uracil and abasic nucleotides are excellent substrates for
Rev1 in vitro and, in yeast, in vivo (5–7,10,14). In germinal
center B cells of vertebrates, uracil and abasic sites are gen-
erated by the activation-induced deoxycytidine deaminase and
base excision repair, respectively, and their formation plays an
essential role in SHM. This highly mutagenic process occurs in
the genomic region, encoding the variable region of an immu-
noglobulin protein in antigen-stimulated germinal center
B cells and is hypothesized to depend on TLS (2). To test
the role of the Rev1 BRCT domain in SHM in mammals, SHM
was analyzed in mice ofmixedbackground (129/Ola·C57Bl/6;
1:3 ratio) by sequencing functionally rearranged Vl1 genes
from memory B cells of 5 to 10-months-old wild-type and
Rev1B/B mice. The frequency of SHM was similar for both
genotypes (Table 4). Moreover, the pattern of SHM in germinal
center B cells, with respect to (i) the frequency and ratio of
transitions versus transversions (Table 4) and (ii) the distri-
bution of base pair substitutions along the rearranged Vl1
gene (data not shown) appeared to be normal in Rev1B/B
mice. In conclusion, deleting the Rev1 BRCT domain does
not interfere with the viability of the cell or of the organism
and has no effect on SHM. In addition, these data suggest that
the BRCT domain of Rev1 is not involved in regulating a
bypass at uracil and abasic residues in vivo.
DISCUSSION
Based on the important role of the BRCT domain of REV1 in
mutagenesis in yeast, we have generated ES cells and mice
carrying a truncation of the Rev1 BRCT domain. Using these
tools, we investigated the role of the BRCT domain of Rev1 in
mutagenesis, including SHM, and in DNA damage responses.
The Rev1B/B ES cells display a normal growth and cloning
efficiency and most probably have retained deoxycytidyl
transferase activity (10,14), as well as the C-terminal binding
to other TLS polymerases (39–41). In contrast, Rev1-deficient
chicken DT40 cells display a strongly reduced viability (4),
indicating that a complete loss of Rev1 in vertebrate cells has
a severe impact on cellular viability. Thus, although clearly
involved in cell cycle responses to exogenous DNA damage
and in mutagenesis, the BRCT domain of Rev1 is not essential
for normal viability.
Compared with wild-type cells, Rev1B/B ES cells and Rev1-
deficient DT40 cells (4) showed a prolonged late S and
G2-phases following UV-C exposure. In fibroblasts from
XP-V patients, lacking a functional TLS Pol h that is respons-
ible for bypass of CPDs, UV-C treatment induces a similarly
extended S-phase (37,42).
In most of the Rev1 BRCT mutant cells, like in Rev1-
deficient chicken DT40 cells and in human Pol h-deficient
fibroblasts (4,37,43,44), UV-C induced a similar frequency
of SCE and chromatid aberrations as in wild-type cells.
Only in a limited number (13%) of Rev1B/B cells, many
arrested replication forks do collapse, as evidenced by the
abnormally high number of chromatid aberrations that is
induced by UV-C. This phenotype supports the temporarily
limited requirement, likely during the late S phase, of the Rev1
BRCT domain for regulating TLS. In addition, these data
indicate that arrested replication forks at this stage of the
cell cycle are refractory to repair by DA (45). Conversely,
arrested replication forks that normally are resolved by DA
can be shuttled into a (mutagenic) TLS pathway since ‘knock-
ing down’ hMms2, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved
in DA, results in the enhancement of UV-C-induced muta-
genesis (46). Moreover, in mouse embryos and chicken DT40
cells deficient for the Rev3 TLS polymerase (47,48) and in
UV-C-exposed Pol h-deficient fibroblasts (37), chromatid-
type aberrations and translocations accumulate. This under-
scores the relevance of TLS in maintaining genome stability
in the presence of DNA damage. Recently, the UV-C-induced
S phase arrest in mammalian cells was attributed to the inhibi-
tion of initiation of replication by the ATR-dependent check-
point (49,50). In S.cerevisiae, this checkpoint mainly affects
the late-firing replication origins (51). BRCT domains bind
proteins phosphorylated by ATR (and ATM) of which ATR is
essential for the replicational stress response following expos-
ure to DNA damaging agents (22–24). It is therefore tempting
to speculate that the Rev1 BRCT domain is involved in regu-
lating an ATR-mediated TLS response, predominantly during
the late S phase.
Most spontaneous Hprt mutants of Rev1B/B ES cells have
lost the expression of Hprt mRNA. This was due to the fre-
quent presence of intragenic deletions. These deletions are
probably caused by the mutagenic end joining of DNA breaks
originating at sites of stalled replication forks at sites of endo-
genous DNA damage. This provides further evidence for the
involvement of the Rev1 BRCT domain in DNA damage
bypass and for the induction of DSB at collapsed replication
forks in the mutant. In the mutant cells, nucleotide substitu-
tion- and 1 frameshift mutagenesis is reduced but not absent,
indicating that the BRCT domain of Rev1 is important for
TLS of a subset of endogenous DNA lesions in vivo (also
see below).
UV-C light induced 3-fold less mutations in all Rev1 mutant
cell lines compared with wild-type cells, in agreement with a
role of the BRCT domain of Rev1 in DNA damage-induced
TLS and mutagenesis. Similarly, the rev1-1 yeast strain, car-
rying a mutation in the REV1 BRCT domain, is hypomutable
by UV-C (25,26); specifically, TLS on (6-4) PP photoproducts
is lost (14). Our mutational spectra analysis on UV-C-induced
Hprt mutants of wild-type ES cells confirms published data,
showing that deoxycytosine is very rarely inserted opposite
UV-C-induced pyrimidine dimers in wild-type S.cerevisiae
and mammalian cells (15,16,52). Our data entail a noncatalytic
role for Rev1 in the TLS of UV-C-induced DNA damage. Of
note, we found that Rev1B/B ES cells have lost all UV-C-
induced transversions at TT dipyrimidine sites. This implies
an essential role for the Rev1 BRCT domain in allowing
error-prone TLS of photoproducts at TT sites. Remarkably,

in Pol h-deficient fibroblasts derived from XP-V patients, the
UV-C-induced frequency of AT to TA transversions at TT
dimer sites is strongly increased (52,53). Thus, the frequency
and spectrum of UV-C-induced mutations in our Rev1B/B cells
and in XP-V-derived cells are complementary. This indicates
that the elevated UV-induced mutagenesis in these patients,
underlying the early onset of skin cancer, may be dependent on
a compensatory Rev1 BRCT domain-dependent pathway of
TLS.
It is unclear which TLS pathway is responsible for the
residual UV-C-induced mutagenesis in Rev1B/B ES cells.
Since the C-terminus of mammalian Rev1 interacts with
TLS pols h, i and k and with Rev7 (39–41), Rev1 may regulate
the activity of either of these polymerases. Although our
Rev1B/B cells (129/Ola background) are defective for pol i
due to a nonsense codon mutation in exon 2 (54), preliminary
results suggest that pol i does not play a role in UV-induced
damage responses (H. Vrieling, data not shown). Pol k is
unable to bypass CPDs or (6–4) PPs in vitro (55). Therefore,
pol z, which can weakly bypass pyrimidine dimers in vitro
(27,56), is a candidate for inducing a residual mutagenesis in
our Rev1B/B cells. Of note, murine cells deficient for Rev3,
encoding the catalytic subunit of pol z, are extremely sensitive
to UV-C light (57; unpublished results), implying a role in the
bypass of UV-C-induced DNA damage.
We have generated Rev1B/B mice, derived from Rev1+/B ES
cells. These mice display no overt phenotype and have normal
SHM, a process that strongly depends on the generation of
uracil and abasic sites via deamination of cytosine at the non-
transcribed strand of transcriptionally active variable regions
of immunoglobulin genes in germinal center B cells (2).
Normal nucleotide exchange patterns of SHM in Rev1B/B
mice appear to be in contrast with the important role of the
Rev1-BRCT motif in regulating TLS of abasic sites in yeast
(14). Possibly, the catalytic domain of Rev1, which probably
has normal activity in the Rev1B/B mutant, performs normal
TLS of abasic sites and uracil residues, in the absence of the
regulatory BRCT domain. In contrast to the BRCT domain of
Rev1, its catalytic domain might be involved in SHM since
chicken DT40 Rev1-deficient cells show almost no non-
templated SHM (4). However, in these cells, most SHM is
induced by copying of immunoglobulin pseudogenes into
rearranged variable light and heavy variable regions via
gene conversion, indicating that non-templated SHM by
Rev1 plays only a minor role (4). Alternatively, in our
Rev1B/B mutant, one or more of the other TLS polymerases
might take over the function of Rev1 in SHM although, in
view of the unique and limited deoxycytidyl transferase activ-
ity of Rev1, this is expected to result in an altered SHM
spectrum.
We predict that exogenous DNA damage-induced muta-
genesis, and carcinogenesis, is reduced in Rev1B/B mice.
Therefore, these mice will be a valuable tool to investigate
the feasibility of inhibition of the Rev1 pathway to counteract
the malignant consequences of exposure to mutagens, includ-
ing chemotherapeutics.
