Abstract
Background: The respiratory tract epithelium is a critical environmental interface that regulates
inflammation. In chronic infectious airway diseases, pathogens may permanently colonize normally
sterile luminal environments. Host-pathogen interactions determine the intensity of inflammation
and thus, rates of tissue injury. Although many cells become refractory to stimulation by pathogen
products, it is unknown whether the airway epithelium becomes either tolerant or hypersensitive
in the setting of chronic infection. Our goals were to characterize the response of well-
differentiated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to
understand whether repeated exposure induced tolerance and, if so, to explore the mechanism(s).
Methods: The apical surface of well-differentiated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cell
cultures was repetitively challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture filtrates or the bacterial
media control. Toxicity, cytokine production, signal transduction events and specific effects of
dominant negative forms of signaling molecules were examined. Additional experiments included
using IL-1β and TNFα as challenge agents, and performing comparative studies with a novel airway
epithelial cell line.
Results: An initial challenge of the apical surface of polarized human airway epithelial cells with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture filtrates induced phosphorylation of IRAK1, JNK, p38, and ERK,
caused degradation of IκBα, generation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factor activity, and
resulted in IL-8 secretion, consistent with activation of the Toll-like receptor signal transduction
pathway. These responses were strongly attenuated following a second Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or
IL-1β, but not TNFα, challenge. Tolerance was associated with decreased IRAK1 protein content
and kinase activity and dominant negative IRAK1 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa -stimulated NF-
κB transcriptional activity.
Conclusion: The airway epithelial cell response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa entails adaptation and
tolerance likely mediated, in part, by down-regulation of IRAK1.
Background
The innate immune system suppresses pathogen attach-
ment, colonization, growth, and invasion and co-ordi-
nates adaptive immunity [1]. Innate immunity entails
recognition of microbial signatures by the cellular reper-
toire of Toll-like receptors (TLRs [2,3]). TLR agonists

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:26 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/26initiate receptor-specific downstream signaling pathways,
ultimately enhancing production of anti-microbial mole-
cules and inflammatory mediators [4]. Much data has
been derived from monocyte/macrophages and myelo-
cytic cell lines, but the TLR pathway also functions in epi-
thelial cells where receptor and co-receptor expression
levels, and the activity of downstream signal transduction
intermediates, likely determine cellular sensitivity to path-
ogen products [5-7]. In the human airway, polymor-
phisms in TLR4, the LPS receptor, modulated the response
to inhaled LPS, and TLR4 was found on primary tracheo-
bronchial epithelial (hTBE) cells [8]. RNA for TLR1-6 was
present in hTBE cells in vitro, and high doses of commer-
cial LPS activated NF-κB and induced the neutrophil
chemotactic cytokine IL-8 and the anti-microbial peptide
beta defensin 2 (hBD-2) [9]. More recent studies demon-
strate TLR2-dependent IL-8 and hBD-2 production by
hTBE cells [10]. Culture filtrates of both Gram-positive
and -negative bacteria and a TLR2 agonist enhanced IL-8
secretion by hTBE cells 3–5 fold [11]. Hemophilus influen-
zae, an important respiratory tract pathogen, signals via
TLR2 in epithelial cells [12]. Recent studies indicate a role
for TLR2 and TLR5 in stimulation of airway epithelial cells
by flagellin or live Gram-positive and -negative bacteria
[13,14] and TLR2 was apparently recruited to lipid rafts at
the apical epithelial cell surface [15]. TLR1-10 expression
and positive responses to several TLR agonists were
recently reported in airway epithelial cells[16]. Thus, the
TLR signal transduction pathway is likely an important
regulator of airway immunity and inflammation.
The regulation of TLR signaling is dynamic. Up-regulation
of TLRs, for example by interferon [17] or virus [18], may
enhance epithelial cell sensitivity to pathogen products.
On the other hand, LPS exposure induces hypo-respon-
siveness to a second challenge, termed LPS tolerance
(reviewed in [19]). Other molecules acting through the
TLR pathway, including mycobacterial products [20] and
lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria [21], also
induce tolerance. Tolerance is associated with decreased
degradation of NF-κB inhibitory proteins, reduced MAP
kinase phosphorylation, prevention of NF-κB and AP-1
activation, altered transcriptional responses and suppres-
sion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine pro-
duction [22]. Decreased cell surface TLR4 protein [23] was
associated with tolerance, but tolerance could not be
attributed solely to receptor loss, since cells that did not
decrease TLR4 still became tolerant, and over-expression
of CD14, TLR4 and MD-2 in HEK293 cells did not prevent
LPS tolerance [20,24]. However, a hypo-responsive state
can be induced at the level of the plasma membrane by
the expression of endogenous, functionally inactive mem-
bers of the Toll-interleukin 1 receptor superfamily [25].
Many substances acting though the TLR signal transduc-
tion pathway induce cross tolerance, including LPS and
IL-1β [22], LPS and mycobacterial products [20], or LPS
and lipoteichoic acid [21]. Tolerance without down-regu-
lation of surface receptors and cross-tolerance suggest neg-
ative regulation of common elements in the downstream
signal transduction pathway. IRAK1 functions just distal
to TLRs and their adaptor proteins [3], and tolerance is
associated with decreased IRAK1 protein many cell types
[26-31]. Alternatively, signaling through IRAK1 may be
impaired due to decreased TLR4-MyD88 complex forma-
tion [32], lack of dissociation from the receptor complex
[33], or increased function of inhibitory forms of IRAK
such as IRAK-M [34]. Hypo-responsiveness may also be
due to events closer to activation of transcription factors,
for example, abrogation of IκBα polyubiqitination [35],
over-expression of unique IκB inhibitory proteins [36], or
production of NF-κB p50 homo-dimers [37], or other fac-
tors that block NF-κB DNA binding [38]. These diverse
negative regulatory processes may be generally important
to protect the host from overly exuberant, destructive
inflammatory responses.
In cystic fibrosis (CF), the lack of functioning CFTR
impairs mucociliary and cough clearance [39], forming a
nidus for infection and allowing organisms such as Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa (Ps. a.) to evade host defenses. Inabil-
ity to clear infected mucus results in continuous exposure
of airway epithelial cells to bacteria and their products.
Ongoing host-pathogen interactions determine the extent
of the inflammatory response, and in turn, rates of tissue
destruction and loss of pulmonary function. Strategically
located between luminal bacterial masses and the host cir-
culation, the airway epithelium is in a key position to reg-
ulate inflammation, but it remains unknown whether the
airway epithelium becomes either hypersensitive or toler-
ant to the chronic presence of bacterial products. Our
goals were to characterize the response of well-differenti-
ated, primary hTBE cells to an apical surface challenge
with Ps. a. products, to determine whether repeated expo-
sure induced tolerance and, if so, to explore the mecha-
nism(s). We show that Ps. a. products activate the TLR
pathway and that hTBE cells become tolerant via a mech-
anism likely involving down-regulation of IRAK1.
Methods
Reagents
Antibodies against phosphorylated or total c-jun NH2-ter-
minal kinases (JNK), p38, extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (ERK), and total IκBα were from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibody against IRAK1 was
from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-
NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits were from Santa Cruz Bio-
technology (Santa Cruz, CA). An ELISA kit for IL-8 (Duo-
Set ELISA Development System) was from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). An in vitro toxicology assay kit for lac-
tate dehydrogenase (LDH) was from Sigma (St. Louis,Page 2 of 16

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:26 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/26MO), as were other standard reagents unless otherwise
specified.
Preparation of Ps. a. filtrate
Ps. a. strain ATCC 27853 was grown in trypticase soy
broth (TSB) for 72 hours at 37°C with shaking at 250
RPM. Following centrifugation at 5,500 × G (4°C) for 30
minutes, the supernatant was 0.45 µm filtered, aliquoted
and stored at -20°C. TSB treated similarly was used as a
control. When used in experiments with cell lines cultured
on plastic, Ps. a. filtrates or TSB were boiled for 10 minutes
to eliminate protease activity. Consistent with prior
reports [40], we found IL-8 stimulatory activity in Ps. a. fil-
trates to be heat-resistant.
Cell culture
Under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol,
hTBE cell cultures were prepared as previously
described[41]. Briefly, epithelial cells were removed from
the lower trachea and bronchi by protease XIV digestion
and cells were plated in BEGM medium on collagen-
coated dishes. Passage 2 cells were cultured on type VI col-
lagen (Sigma) coated Millicell CM inserts (0.4 µM pore
size, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) in ALI
medium. The cell seeding density for 10 mm and 30 mm
diameter inserts was 0.15 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells per insert,
respectively. Following confluence after 5–7 days, cultures
were maintained with an air-liquid interface until well-
differentiated and were used at 21 days. Endotoxin in ALI
medium was less than 100 pg/ml (LAL assay, Bio-Whit-
taker, Walkersville, MD). A recently described immortal-
ized cell line, referred to as AALEB, was derived from hTBE
cells by infection with retroviruses expressing SV40 early
region and telomerase reverse transcriptase [42]. AALEB
cells were grown on plastic dishes in BEGM medium
under standard culture conditions.
Ps. a. filtrate challenge
Experiments with well-differentiated hTBE cells on 12 and
30 mm Millicell inserts were performed in 12 or 6 well
plates, respectively. Before challenge, the apical culture
surface was rinsed once with Dulbecco's PBS. Ps. a. filtrate
in ALI medium supplemented with 10% human serum
(Sigma #H4522) was added to the apical culture surface,
using 100 µl for 12 mm inserts and 500 µl for 30 mm
inserts. One or two ml of ALI medium was added to the
basolateral side of the 12 or 6 well plates, respectively, and
the cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24
hours. Following removal of basolateral medium for IL-8
or LDH assay, the apical and basolateral surfaces were
washed twice with PBS. After incubation at 37°C for 1–2
hours with fresh basolateral ALI medium, the cultures
were re-challenged apically with Ps. a. filtrate plus serum
as described above. Challenges with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) or
TNFα (25 ng/ml) were performed in ALI medium without
serum. IL-8 and LDH assays were performed with com-
mercial kits as specified previously [11] and are based on
results from triplicate wells using cells from at least three
different individuals, unless stated otherwise.
Western blot analysis
At specified times following challenge, cells were har-
vested from 30 mm inserts into ice-cold lysis buffer (100
mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5.0 mM NaF, 2 mM
EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 100 µM TPCK, 100 µM
quercetin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml
pepstatin) using a cell scraper, transferred to tubes and set
on ice for 20 minutes. Following centrifugation, protein
concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein
Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples were
resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–20% tris-glycine gels, Invitro-
gen, San Diego, CA) and blotted onto Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Blots were
blocked in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk
powder, incubated with primary then secondary antibod-
ies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West
Grove, PA) followed by chemiluminescence detection of
peroxidase (Pierce).
Nuclear extracts
Cells were scraped from 30 mm inserts into 0.8 ml ice-
cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 µM PMSF, 1
µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 µM DTT) and
were centrifuged. The cell pellet was re-suspended in
buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.25% NP-40, 1 µM
PMSF, 1 µg/ml leupeptin and 1 µg/ml pepstatin) on ice
for 10 minutes and cells were lysed with a Dounce
homogenizer (Kontes Scientific Glassware, Vineland, NJ).
The nuclei were extracted with high salt buffer (20 mM
Hepes, pH 7.9, 450 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 25% glycerol, 1 µM PMSF, 1 µg/ml
leupeptin and 1 µg/ml pepstatin) on ice for 20 minutes
with occasional vortexing. Supernatants were prepared by
centrifugation and protein concentration was determined
as above.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
NF-κB-specific consensus oligonucleotide (5'
AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC3') and AP1-specific
consensus oligonucleotide (5'
CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA3') were from Promega
(Madison, WI). DNA probes were 32P end labeled with T4
polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Nuclear extracts (2.5
µg) were incubated with 40,000–60,000 cpm of 32P end
labeled oligonucleotide probe in binding buffer (final
volume of 10 µl) containing 1 µg poly dI-dC (Sigma), 10
mM TrisHCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml
BSA, 4% glycerol for 20 minutes at room temperature. For
supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were preincubatedPage 3 of 16

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:26 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/26with 0.5 µl of antisera against NF-κB p50 or p65 sub-units
for 10 minutes in binding buffer. Unlabeled NF-κB, AP-1
or SP1 (5' ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC3') oligonu-
cleotides were used as competitors. Complexes were sepa-
rated on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels,
which were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager
screen (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).
IRAK1 in vitro kinase assay
Cells were harvested from 30 mm inserts into 600 µl ice-
cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 mMβ-glycer-
ophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM benzamidine, 5 mM para-
nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 µg/ml
leupeptin, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin)
using a cell scraper. After brief vortexing and incubation
on ice for 20 minutes, tubes were centrifuged and super-
natant protein concentrations were determined as above.
For immunoprecipitation, 1000 µg of protein extract was
precleared with 2 µg of normal rabbit IgG and 20 µl of
protein G-agarose slurry. Protein G beads were pelleted
and the supernatant was incubated with 2 µg of rabbit IgG
against IRAK1. Protein G-agarose slurry (20 µl) was added
and incubated for 1 hour and the beads were washed 3
times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer with-
out 32P ATP (see below). Beads were suspended in 20 µl of
kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. 20 mM MgCl2, 20
mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM benzamidine, 20 mM
para-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.4 mM PMSF; 1 mM
sodium metabisulfite, 2 µM cold ATP and 10 µCi γ-32P
ATP). Reactions were allowed to proceed at 30°C for 30
min and terminated with SDS sample buffer. Samples
were then run on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and
exposed to a PhosphorImager screen as above.
NF-κB reporter assay and expression of dominant negative 
IRAK1
Adenoviral vectors constitutvely expressing the LacZ gene
from the CMV promoter (Ad.CMV-lacZ) and NF-κB-
responsive firefly luciferase (Ad.NF-κB-fLuc) have been
described previously [43]. We created an adenoviral vec-
tor expressing the DD domain of IRAK1 (NCBI accession
# NM_001569, amino acids 1–80), which is reported to
function as a dominant negative (dn) [44]. A plasmid
encoding human IRAK1 was kindly provided by Dr. X. Li
(The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) and was used as a
template for PCR using primers (forward: 5'-CTC GAG
GTG CCA GGC TGT GA-3', reverse: 5'-GCT AGC CGG
CAG CCA TGG-3') adding 5' and 3' XhoI and NheI sites,
respectively. The amplified fragment was cloned into the
pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was
digested with XhoI /NheI and the fragment was ligated
into XhoI /NheI-digested pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-1 adenovi-
ral expression vector plasmid (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA).
This strategy placed the DD domain of IRAK1 in frame

cell culures was challenged with the indicated concentration

the 24-hour conditioned basolateral medium. The results are 
the mean + SEM from 3 independent experiments with cell

was verified by sequencing. Adenoviral vectors were cre-
ated, plaque-purified and amplified using conventional
methods. AALEB or hTBE cells were transfected with
Ad.CMV-lacZ and Ad.NF-κB-fLuc and pShuttle-IRES-
hrGFP-1 empty vector or pShuttle-dnIRAK1-IRES-hrGFP-
1, using a 1:10 ratio of reporter and expression vectors,
respectively. Cells were exposed to viruses for 2 hours, 48
hours prior to experimental challenge, using transient per-
meabilization [45] for hTBE cells. Eight hours after chal-
lenge, cells were lysed and fLuc and β-galactosidase
activity measured as described previously [46,47].
Results
The initial response of hTBE cells to Ps. a. products
To simulate in vivo host-bacterial product interactions, we
challenged the apical surface of polarized, well-differenti-
ated hTBE cells with late stationary phase Ps. a. filtrates.
Exposure of the apical culture surface to 20% TSB (the
negative control bacterial broth) in the presence of 10%
human serum added as a source of LPS binding protein
and soluble CD14, for 24 hours, caused a modest, < 1
fold, culture-dependent increase in IL-8 secretion ([11]
and data not shown). Challenge with Ps. a. filtrate
induced IL-8 secretion as a function of dose (Figure 1A),
causing an average 6.3 ± 1.4 fold increase over the TSB
control at the 20% Ps. a. filtrate dose (mean ± SEM, cells
from 3 independent donors). We have previously shown
that Ps. a. treatment similarly induces IL-6, but not IL-10
or RANTES [11]. Ps. a. challenge of well-differentiated
hTBE cultures was non-toxic, as assessed by lack of LDH
release into the medium (Figure 1B and 1C) and mainte-
nance of a patent air-liquid interface [for more informa-
tion, including a positive control, see the online
supplement of reference [11], http://ajrccm.atsjour
nals.org/cgi/content/full/169/5/645/DC1)].
In several cell types, inflammatory mediator synthesis fol-
lowing bacterial product challenge is regulated by TLR
activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. We
determined whether Ps. a. filtrates stimulated the TLR sig-
nal transduction pathway in well-differentiated hTBE
Ps. a. filtrate induced IRAK1 autophosphorylation, IκBα degradation and MAP kinase phosphorylationFigure 2
Ps. a. filtrate induced IRAK1 autophosphorylation, IκBα degradation and MAP kinase phosphorylation. A)Pro-
teins were harvested from day-21 hTBE cell cultures treated apically with 20% Ps. a. filtrate or from THP1 monocytic cells 
treated with LPS at the times indicated. Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAK1 or control IgG for 
each cell type. Precipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assay and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to a 
Phosphoimager screen. B and C) Day-21 hTBE cell cultures were treated with Ps. a. filtrate, and harvested for western blot of 
IκBα (B) or phospho- and total MAP kinases (C) at the indicated time points. Equal amounts of protein were run per lane on 
each gel. The βactin and total MAP kinase western blots represent re-probing of the IκBα and phospho-MAP kinase blots, 
respectively. The results are representative of 3 separate experiments with cells derived from 3 different donors.Page 5 of 16

Ps. a. filtrate increased nuclear content of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. Nuclear extracts were prepared 
from day-21 hTBE cell cultures challenged apically with Ps. a. filtrate or IL-1β at the times noted and equal amounts of nuclear 
protein per lane were subjected to EMSA using oligonucleotide probes for NF-κB (A) or AP-1 (B). The inhibitor and supershift 
assays were all performed with nuclei extracted 2 hours after TSB or Ps. a. challenge. The results are representative of 3 sepa-
rate experiments with cells derived from 3 different donors.Page 6 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)
Respiratory Research 2005, 6:26 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/26cells. Challenge of hTBE cultures with 20% Ps. a. filtrate
promptly induced IRAK1 phosphorylation (Figure 2A),
IκBα protein degradation (Figure 2B), and MAP kinase
phosphorylation, including JNK, p38, and ERK (Figure
2C). On the basis of equivalent protein input to the
immunoprecipitaiton reaction, the LPS-treated THP-1
monocytic cells, used as positive and negative controls,
contained much more phospho-IRAK1 than hTBE cells.
We did not reduce the concentrations of growth factors in
the culture media prior to challenge thus, ERK phosphor-
ylation was relatively high at baseline. Nonetheless, we
still observed enhanced ERK phosphorylation after Ps. a.
challenge. As predicted, IκBα degradation and MAP
kinase activation preceded elevated nuclear content of NF-
κB and AP-1 transcription factors, respectively (Figure 3A
and 3B). The predominant shifted NF-κB band was com-
posed of p50/p65 heterodimers. We did not attempt
supershift assays to identify the subset of AP-1 transcrip-
tion factors. IRAK1 phosphorylation and stimulation of
the NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways is consistent with Ps.
a. filtrate activation of the MyD88-dependent component
of the TLR receptor signal transduction pathway in hTBE
cells.
The response of hTBE cells to repeated Ps. a. challenge
To assess whether prior exposure to Ps. a. filtrates induced
tolerance, we re-challenged hTBE cell cultures 24 hours
after the initial exposure, studying the 4 possible combi-
nations (Figure 4A). As illustrated in figure 4B, initial
treatment with TSB caused minimal IL-8 secretion and no
change following a second TSB treatment. Initial TSB
treatment followed by Ps. a. resulted in enhanced IL-8
production during the second 24-hour period. Initial
exposure to Ps. a. induced a five-fold increase in IL-8 secre-
tion and when these cells were re-challenged with TSB
they displayed lesser IL-8 secretion, but still elevated over
the initial TSB control. Importantly, cells initially chal-
lenged with Ps. a. and re-challenged with Ps. a. showed
less stimulation of IL-8 secretion during the second 24-
hour period, almost identical to that of TSB-re-challenged
cells and, thus, were tolerant. Tolerance was consistently
observed, and IL-8 production by cells from 3 different
individuals during the second 24 hour period was nor-
malized by dividing the Ps. a. -pretreated IL-8 value by the
corresponding value in TSB-pretreated cultures (Fig 4C).
This analysis confirmed no significant differences in IL-8
secretion during the second 24-hour period between Ps. a.
and TSB treated cells that were pre-exposed to Ps. a. fil-
trate. Re-challenge of Ps. a.-exposed cells with Ps. a.
reduced IL-8 secretion by an average of 44 ± 3% (p < 0.05)
compared to TSB pretreated cells. Interestingly, Ps. a.
induced significant tolerance to a subsequent stimulation
with IL-1β (47 ± 9 % reduction; p < .05), but not TNFα
(20 ± 14 % reduction; p > .05). Hetero-tolerance between
Ps. a. and IL-1β, but not TNFα, suggests that tolerance
occurs at a point in common to the TLR and IL-1β
pathways, but upstream of the convergence with the TNFα
pathway (see Discussion).
To explore the mechanism of hTBE cell tolerance to Ps. a.
products, we studied IκBα degradation, MAP kinase phos-
phorylation, and generation of nuclear NF-κB and AP-1
binding activity at an optimal time following the second
challenge based on the prior time course studies. As
shown in figure 5A and 5B, pre-exposure to Ps. a. for 24
hours largely prevented IκBα degradation and
phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK MAP kinases in
response to a second Ps. a. challenge, while cells pre-
exposed to TSB responded vigorously. Likewise, pre-expo-
sure to Ps. a. prevented the activation of NF-κB or AP-1
transcription factors (Figure 5C).
IRAK-1 as a critical determinant of hTBE cell sensitivity to 
Ps. a. 
IL-1β, but not TNFα hetero-tolerance and the elimination
of both MAP kinase and NF-κB responses in tolerant hTBE
cells focused our attention on upstream elements of the
signal transduction pathway. Prior studies have suggested
that decreased IRAK1 protein is associated with LPS toler-
ance [26-31]. As illustrated in Figure 6A and 6B, IRAK1
protein content decreased during the initial stimulation
and was reduced 62% ± 4% (mean ± SEM, n = cell cultures
from 3 different individuals) at 24 hours following the
initial Ps. a. challenge. Studying the same four exposure
permutations described above, we found that IRAK1
remaining 24 hours following the initial Ps. a. challenge
could not be autophosphorylated after a second Ps. a.
challenge (Figure 6C). Thus, tolerance to Ps. a. products in
hTBE cells was associated with reduced IRAK1 protein
content and kinase activity. Furthermore, similar to the
previously noted hetero-tolerance in IL-8 secretion
between Ps. a. filtrate and IL-1β (Figure 3C), prior expo-
sure to Ps. a. prevented IRAK1 phosphorylation in
response to IL-1β, and vice versa (Figure 6D).
To facilitate molecular approaches towards understanding
tolerance mechanisms in airway epithelial cells, we stud-
ied AALEB cells, a novel SV40 and telomerase immortal-
ized hTBE derived cell line [42]. AALEB cells on plastic
detached from the culture dishes when exposed to
unboiled Ps. a. filtrates, presumably due to protease activ-
ity. Since prior studies demonstrated that Ps. a.-derived IL-
8 stimulatory activity for A549 cells was heat resistant
[40], we tested boiled Ps. a. filtrates on both hTBE and
AALEB cells. Similar to unboiled filtrates in the presence
of serum, hTBE cells challenged with 20% boiled Ps. a. fil-
trate, without serum, secreted IL-8 and developed toler-
ance (Figure 7A). Removal of the Ps. a. stimulus, followed
by PBS washing and media change, and a 24 or 48 hour
"rest time" promoted re-sensitization of hTBE cells.Page 7 of 16

the Ps. a.-pretreated IL-8 value by the corresponding value in TSB-pretreated cultures (eg. Ps. a. → Ps. a./TSB → Ps. a.). The 
results are the average ± SEM of three independent experiments using cells from different donors. P values are based on

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:26 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/26Although the ratio of cells to media, and thus absolute IL-
8 levels, are much lower in conventional plastic cultures
of AALEB cells than in air-liquid interface cultures of hTBE
cells, tolerance and loss of tolerance regarding IL-8 secre-
tion was almost identical (Figure 7B). Thus, the AALEB
cell line is apparently a good model to study tolerance in
airway epithelial cells.
To examine the effects of Ps. a. on NF-κB dependent gene
transcription, we transfected hTBE and AALEB cells with
adenoviruses expressing NF-κB-driven luciferase and con-
stitutively expressed LacZ reporter genes. Transient perme-
abilization with caproic acid [45] was necessary for
efficient gene transfer to hTBE cells. Luciferase activity
normalized for β gal was measured at baseline and 8 and
24 hours following stimulation with the 4 possible com-
binations of Ps. a. or TSB. Ps. a. strongly simulated NF-κB-
driven luciferase activity in naive or TSB pre-treated hTBE
or AALEB cells, but the response was strongly attenuated
in Ps. a. pretreated cells (compare the slopes of the 0–8
hour and 25–33 hour groups in Figure 7C and 7D). These
results suggest a strong NF-κB driven transcriptional com-
ponent of Ps. a. stimulation that was inhibited in tolerant
airway epithelial cells.
Having established a reporter assay in a relevant cell type,
it was now possible to examine whether IRAK1 down-reg-
ulation was correlative or causal in airway epithelial toler-
ance. AALEB cells were transfected with a 1:10 ratio of
adenoviral particles expressing both reporter genes and
dnIRAK1 [44] or the empty vector control, respectively. In
both hTBE and AALEB cells, NF-κB driven luciferase activ-
ity was approximately 5-fold greater in response to Ps. a.
in cells infected with the control, empty vector. Luciferase
activity was reduced significantly (52% in hTBE cells, n =
2 independent experiments; 55 ± 8 % in AALEB cells, n =
3 independent experiments), but not completely, by
expression of dnIRAK1. Representative experiments are
illustrated in Figure 7E and 7F, respectively. In AALEB
cells, the dnIRAK1 construct caused an average 86 ± 1%
decrease in IL-1β-stimulated NF-κB-driven luciferase
activity but did not affect TNFα stimulated activity. These
results confirm an important role for IRAK1 in the
response to Ps. a. products, presumably via its integral
function in the MyD88-dependent portion of the TLR
pathway, and strongly suggest that loss or inhibition of
IRAK1 is an important component of tolerance.
Discussion
The host must eradicate pathogens while preventing tissue
injury due to inflammation. Repeated exposure of airway
epithelium to microbial products is a hallmark of chronic
infectious lung diseases but the adaptation has not been
previously studied in these key cells. Polarized, well-dif-
ferentiated hTBE cell cultures used in the current studies
recapitulate the morphology and mucus transport func-
tion found in vivo [39]. We challenged the apical surface
of these cultures with soluble products of Ps. a., an impor-
tant airway pathogen. Prior studies focused on the direct
interaction of live Ps. a. bacteria with epithelial cells (see
[48] for review). However, bacteria in chronically infected
CF lungs are present mostly as intra-luminal masses distal
from the airway epithelial surface [49]. Thus, we chose to
model the interaction of the apical membrane of polar-
ized hTBE cells with diffusible Ps. a. products, rather than
live bacteria. We used late stationary phase TSB cultures of
a common strain of Ps. a. instead of clinical isolates. Ps. a.
in CF patients frequently become mucoid, produce mod-
ified forms of LPS [50] and also secrete quorum sensing
molecules [51]. Future studies will be necessary to deter-
mine whether modifications of Ps. a. typically found in
chronic human infections alter epithelial responses.
Although we used non-inoculated TSB processed in paral-
lel as a negative control, we cannot completely exclude
that a portion of the stimulation was due to TSB break-
down products induced by bacterial metabolism of the
broth. Well-differentiated hTBE cells likely have greater
physiologic relevance than cell lines grown directly on
plastic. However, well-characterized cell lines facilitate
mechanistic studies, so we also used a newly developed
airway epithelial cell line (AALEB).
Initial exposure of hTBE or AALEB cells to Ps. a. filtrate
induced IL-8 release. This response was preceded by phos-
phorylation of IRAK1, JNK, p38 and ERK, degradation of
IκBα, and generation of NF-κB and AP-1 and transcrip-
tional activity in hTBE cells. IRAK1 phosphorylation lead-
ing to activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors
is consistent with activation of the MyD88-dependent
portion of the TLR signal transduction pathway. A main
finding of the present study in both hTBE and AALEB cells
was that cells previously exposed to Ps. a. products for 24
hours had a greatly diminished IL-8 response. Likewise,
IRAK1 phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, MAP kinase
activation and generation of NF-κB and AP-1 and tran-
scriptional activity after a second Ps. a. exposure were all
markedly reduced in Ps. a.-tolerant cells. NF-κB reporter
assays strongly suggested that Ps. a.-induced cytokine
secretion was transcriptionally regulated and that toler-
ance was associated with decreased activation of NF-κB
transcription factors. The cells were hetro-tolerant to IL-
1β, but not TNFα, suggesting that tolerance occurs at a
point in common to the TLR and IL-1β pathways, but
upstream of the convergence with the TNFα pathway,
which is precisely the location of IRAK1 (Figure 8). Ps. a.
tolerance was associated with decreased IRAK1 protein
content and failure to phosphorylate IRAK1 which is rem-
iniscent of LPS tolerance in other cell types [26-31]. A very
recent study demonstrates that macrophage tolerance to
the prototypical TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys is due to ablationPage 11 of 16

Tolerance and loss of tolerance in IL-8 secretion and NF-κB driven transcription is similar in hTBE cells and 
the AALEB cell line, and dnIRAK1 inhibits responses to Ps. a. and IL-1β but not TNFα. A-D) The apical surface of 
well-differentiated, day-21 hTBE cell cultures (A, C) or AALEB cells in conventional culture on plastic (B, D) were challenged 
with boiled Ps. a. filtrate (P) or TSB (T) in the absence of human serum as indicated. In A and B, cultures were incubated for 24 
hours, and following washing and media change, the apical surfaces were re-challenged when indicated. IL-8 was measured in 
the media 24 hours following the second challenge. C and D) Cells were transfected with adenoviral vectors expressing consti-
tutive or NF-κB driven reporter genes as described in Methods and were challenged with TSB or Ps. a. and lysed for reporter 
gene assay as indicated. Note the steep slope of the Ps. a. response in naive or TSB-pretreated cells versus the attenuated 
slope in Ps.a.-pretreated cells. E, F) hTBE and AALEB cells were transfected with adenoviral vectors expressing constitutive and 
NF-κB driven reporter genes and dnIRAK1 or a control vector as described in the Methods and were lysed for reporter gene 
assay 8 hours after treatment as indicated. dnIRAK1 inhibited approximately 50% of the Ps. a. response in both cell types, and, 
in AALEB cells, >90% of the IL-1β response, but not the TNFα response. All points represent the mean of triplicate wells ± 
SD. The results in panel E ands F are representative of 2 and 3 separate experiments, respectivelyPage 12 of 16

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:26 http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/26of IRAK1 [52]. Additional evidence for a key role of IRAK1
in the airway epithelial response to Ps. a. was suggested by
expression of dnIRAK1, which diminished NF-κB-driven
transcription approximately 50%. In AALEB cells,
dnIRAK1 did not alter the response to TNFα, but reduced
IL-1β effects nearly 90%. Thus, it is likely that factors
present in Ps. a. filtrates activate both IRAK1-dependent
and -independent pathways leading to NF-κB activation.
It is interesting to consider whether tolerant airway epi-
thelial cells were generally "run down" and incapable of
responding, but IL-8 release and NF-κB-driven luciferase
activity after TNFα treatment of Ps. a.-tolerant cells indi-
cates that the downstream signalling apparatus was fully
capable of responding. Components upstream of the con-
vergence of the TLR and TNFα pathways may indeed be
"run down", in fact, it is our hypothesis that decreased
IRAK1 protein results in Ps. a. tolerance in airway epithe-
lial cells.
Generic IRAK was first recognized as a crucial component
of the IL-1β signalling pathway and molecular cloning
revealed homology to the Drosophila protein kinase Pelle
[4]. More recent studies have revealed 4 IRAK isoforms
[53], a critical role for tandem action of IRAK1 and 4 [54]
and an inhibitory role for IRAK-M [34]. Ligation of TIR
domain-containing receptors induces IRAK1 phosphor-
ylation both auto-catalytically and by unidentified
kinases. Phosphorylated IRAK1 becomes degraded by
proteasomes in cells stimulated by IL-1β but not TNFα,
which correspondingly results in desensitization of the IL-
1β, but not TNFα response [55]. The precise mechanisms
regulating IRAK1 localization and function during the
propagation and termination of the TLR signal in hTBE
cells are not fully understood, and require further study.
While the kinetics of the initial response of naive cells sug-
gested a direct interaction of Ps. a. products to trigger the
TLR pathway, airway epithelial cells at 24 hours were
likely exposed to released autocrine/paracrine factors that
may have also contributed to tolerance. However, this was
probably not mediated by IL-1β, since this cytokine was
consistently undetectable in hTBE cell media after Ps. a.
stimulation (SHR and MWV unpublished observations).
Moreover, such factors would have to selectively target the
upstream TLR/IL-1β, pathway since TNFα responses were
not affected.
Ps. a. is a complex and adaptable bacterium that secretes
many factors known to damage host cells and/or induce
inflammation such as pilin, flagellin, pyocyanin, hemo-
lysins, autoinducer, LPS, proteases, and small unidenti-
fied heat-stable factors [9,40,50,56-59]. There is a broad
array of mechanisms by which these agents may act,
including TLR activation, generalized oxidative stress due
to redox cycling of pyocyanin, and proteolytic
modification of target cells by Ps. a. elastase or alkaline
protease. IRAK activation in a human bronchial cell line
has been shown following neutrophil elastase [60]. Rapid
activation of IRAK1, in conjunction with desensitization
of the IL-1β but not the TNFα response, suggests that Ps.
a. products directly trigger an MyD88-dependent TLR
pathway. Activation of airway epithelial cells by a variety
of live bacteria and bacterial products is TLR2-dependent
[10,12-14]. Polymyxin B treatment is commonly used to
block LPS effects [61], but it did not reduce Ps. a.-stimu-
lated hTBE cell IL-8 secretion, and Ps. a. derived LPS is a
poor inducer of IL-8 in these cells (SHR and MWV unpub-
lished observations), suggesting that LPS stimulation of
TLR4 was not predominant. Further studies are needed to
chemically identify the most quantitatively important TLR
pathway-stimulating substance(s) produced by Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa. In this regard, recent studies indicate
a potential role for TLR2 activation by lipopeptides
encoded by Ps. a. genes [62].
While controversial, several lines of evidence suggest that
inflammatory responses in the CF airway may be intrinsi-
cally enhanced or protracted due to the absence of func-
tioning CFTR (see [11] and references therein). Thus,
examination of differences in the development of toler-
ance in CF cells is worthy of further scrutiny. Although
hTBE cells in our in vitro model became tolerant to Ps. a.,
chronically infected airways in CF humans are typically
severely inflamed. Whether tolerance exists in vivo, if it is
helpful or harmful, different in CF, or if it is overwhelmed
by the heavy bacterial burden are important, but unan-
swered questions. Multiple cell types, which are con-
stantly turning over, contribute to in vivo responses.
Bacterial products may penetrate beyond the epithelial
barrier to trigger inflammation or systemic responses. We
speculate that epithelial tolerance to Ps. a. occurs in vivo,
and that inflammation would be even more severe in its
absence. However, further clinical and/or animal model
studies are needed to address these key questions.
Conclusion
We have shown that exposure of primary, well-differenti-
ated hTBE cells to Ps. a. products causes selective toler-
ance. Ps. a. products elicit a response via the TLR signal
transduction pathway that becomes down-regulated,
likely due to decreased IRAK1 protein content and inhibi-
tion of IRAK1 phosphorylation. A greater understanding
of the precise mechanisms decreasing airway epithelial
cell generation of inflammatory mediators will suggest
new avenues for anti-inflammatory therapies to minimize
lung destruction typical of CF and other chronic infec-
tious airway diseases.Page 13 of 16
