ABSTRACT
There is an increasing interest in using literature
mining techniques to complement information
extracted from annotation databases or generated
by bioinformatics applications. Here we present
PLAN2L, a web-based online search system that
integrates text mining and information extraction
techniques to access systematically information
useful for analyzing genetic, cellular and molecular
aspects of the plant model organism Arabidopsis
thaliana. Our system facilitates a more efficient
retrieval of information relevant to heterogeneous
biological topics, from implications in biological
relationships at the level of protein interactions
and gene regulation, to sub-cellular locations of
gene products and associations to cellular and
developmental processes, i.e. cell cycle, flowering,
root, leaf and seed development. Beyond single
entities, also predefined pairs of entities can be pro-
vided as queries for which literature-derived rela-
tions together with textual evidences are returned.
PLAN2L does not require registration and is freely
accessible at http://zope.bioinfo.cnio.es/plan2l.
INTRODUCTION
Gene regulatory mechanisms and protein interactions are
studied in detail to understand how complex developmen-
tal processes are controlled. Biological annotation data-
bases provide functional descriptions of gene products, the
basic components of such biological processes, through
manual literature inspection, resulting generally in asso-
ciations of biological entities to a set of controlled vocab-
ulary terms contained in structured database records (1).
Despite the obvious strength of controlled vocabularies
for annotation consistency, information exchange and
data analysis, functional annotations of proteins do not
provide a straightforward way to trace back the biological
evidence supporting each annotation, making it some-
times cumbersome for human domain experts to directly
interpret under which biological context and experimental
conditions a given annotation applies. Considering the
growing amount of published articles, to manually anno-
tate newly described functional gene product characteriza-
tions as well as maintenance and update of already
annotated entities is a challenging task. This motivated
recent attempts to enable a more systematic access to rel-
evant information hidden in large literature repositories
using text mining and information extraction (IE) technol-
ogies, with the aim of not only supporting the literature
curation process, but especially for providing suitable
information retrieval systems useful for life sciences (2).
Results generated by text mining systems have the general
advantage to be directly interpretable by the end users,
the human domain experts, in case direct links to the tex-
tual evidences are supported. Currently existing online lit-
erature mining systems mostly focus on very particular
biological aspects, such as the extraction of protein–
protein interactions (3), protein–keyword co-mentions or
gene regulation events without directly integrating all
these heterogeneous relation types into a single applica-
tion. Relevance, not only of individual bio-entities but
also of their interactions and regulation events for devel-
opmental processes studied in model organisms such as
the plant Arabidopsis thaliana have not been addressed
previously using text mining approaches. Arabidopsis
thaliana, the ﬁrst plant to be completely sequenced, is
being used not only for experimental research, but also
increasingly by systems biology and bioinformatics
approaches to understand and model central biological
processes (4). Databases like TAIR [The Arabidopsis
Information Resource, (5)] or UniProt (6) are providing
plant biologists with valuable infrastructures of manually
curated information, but only few attempts have been
made to implement literature mining applications for
this model organism. The Dragon Plant Biology
Explorer (DPBE) was an online text mining application
for plant biology based on integration and combination of
collections of manually curated vocabularies compiled for

several topics to facilitate a more targeted literature
search (7). PubSearch constitutes another system for
semi-automated retrieval of literature that can be used
to curate articles to extract manually annotations for
gene products with Gene Ontology terms (8). It is primar-
ily based on simple term matching and does not explore
machine learning techniques to provide more sophisti-
cated retrieval capabilities. Another system primarily
used for literature curation by model organism databases
is Textpresso (9), now integrated at TAIR to facilitate a
better access to information relevant for Arabidopsis.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
PLAN2L is an online text mining application dedicated to
improve retrieval of knowledge by integrating and scoring
information extracted from textual sources for various
biological topics related with the description interactome
associations in Arabidopsis. Figure 1 shows a general ﬂow
chart of the PLAN2L system 1 (a more complete descrip-
tion of the technical aspects can be found in the documen-
tation of the web system).
TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TEXT
MINING PIPELINE
A document retrieval pipeline that takes into account sev-
eral sources of evidence for the determining whether a
given article is associated to A. thaliana was implemented
exploiting: (i) external references derived from multiple
databases providing annotations for Arabidopsis proteins.
(ii) Organism and taxonomic name tagging using dictio-
nary lookup based on a species lexicon derived from
the NCBI Taxonomy that was automatically extended
using a rule-based approach to account for typograph-
ical variants and abbreviations of species names.
(iii) Keyword-based retrieval from PubMed and
PubMed Central. Additionally, a full text collection of
Arabidopsis-related articles was constructed from a local
repository of open access full-text articles as well as using
customized article collection tools. Plain text conversion
was carried out through a combination of systems includ-
ing pdftotext and PDFlib. The detection of links between
the literature and protein or genes of PLAN2L is based
on the construction and lookup of a gene lexicon. This
gene dictionary integrated A. thaliana gene names and
symbols derived from multiple databases, including
TAIR, SwissProt and from a collection of gene and pro-
tein names identiﬁed by a machine learning-named entity
recognition program (ABNER) as well as based a rule-
based approach considering morphological cues and
name length to identify potential Arabidopsis gene sym-
bols. Lexicon expansion using manually crafted rules was
carried out. To detect gene regulatory relations, we
adapted an IE architecture relying on a pipeline of seman-
tic/syntactic rules. We applied part-of-speech tagging of
each word using a GENIA-trained version of Treetager
(10). Some of the POS tags were automatically substituted

with more semantically oriented labels (e.g. organisms,
protein/gene names and activation verbs). The text with
mixed syntactic and semantic tags was fed into a SCOL
parser (11), which generated a tree-like structure by apply-
ing a modiﬁed CASS grammar. These rules constitute
cascades of ﬁnite-state automata, and use patterns that
combine both grammatical- and biological-meaning fea-
tures in the linguistic structure. We implemented exten-
sions of the rules to handle frequent phrase coordination
and prepositional anaphora. The extraction of protein
interaction evidence associations was addressed using a
machine learning sentence classiﬁer approach relying
on manually selected interaction evidence sentences (12).
The used sentence classiﬁer relies on a Support Vector
Machines algorithm trained on set of manually classiﬁed
interaction evidence passages derived from a collection
used at the second BioCreative challenge (12), and
obtained a performance of 89.75 for precision and 92.62
for recall using a radial basis kernel function on a
balanced test set. For retrieving protein localization
descriptions, we explored both the use of semantic–
syntactic frames for extracting a ﬁne-grained association
between proteins and subcellular location mentions
together with a machine learning sentence classiﬁer for
retrieving protein localization description sentences in
general. The initial step followed, consisted in the con-
struction of a sub-cellular location dictionary that inte-
grates location keywords and synonyms derived from
SwissProt together with cellular component terms from
Gene Ontology. Location term mentioning sentences
were manually revised to derive hand-crafted location
frames. Additionally, a location sentence classiﬁer was
constructed using a collection of 2264 protein location
description sentences. A central component of PLAN2L
is the scoring of each evidence sentence according to its
relevance for complex temporal biological events (topics),
at the cellular level (cell cycle) as well as at the level
of developmental processes. We therefore implemented
a classiﬁer for scoring cell-cycle relevant abstracts and
document passages. The SVM text classiﬁer was trained
on a collection of cell-cycle relevant abstracts and nonre-
levant abstracts and then applied to a literature collection
of abstracts and full-text articles mentioning A. thaliana
genes. Additionally, four speciﬁc sentence classiﬁers for
the most relevant developmental processes in higher
plants, namely (i) ﬂowering, (ii) leaf development,
(iii) root development and (iv) seed development/germina-
tion have been developed. The tool provides a comprehen-
sive approach to assist in the selection and ranking of
genes, proteins, documents and terms relevant to a speciﬁc
biological process for this model organism. Additional
details on the diﬀerent modules, their characteristics and
assessment are provided at the PLAN2L web.
FUNCTIONALITY AND USAGE
The PLAN2L interface handles user-provided plain text
keywords, protein/gene names or symbols. Some of the
components allow additionally searching with gene or
protein identiﬁers. The currently supported identiﬁers
include TAIR gene identiﬁers and UniProt primary acces-
sion numbers. Based on a user survey that we carried out
to get feedback from biologists on the PLAN2L system,
aspects that were positively rated included its easy to use
and intuitive query interface and the direct retrieval of
evidence sentences for multiple topics. Aspects that were
improved according to the user comments covered addi-
tional documentation on the system and the sentence scor-
ing mechanism. PLAN2L supports six types of search
strategies, each with its own query page, to avoid introdu-
cing unnecessary complexity through advanced search
interfaces with complicated menu options. We will brieﬂy
describe each of these six search types and provide a
case study to illustrate the type of results generated
by PLAN2L.
(i) The basic search type allows retrieval of multiple
biological topic associations for a given user
query, consisting in ranked lists of evidence sen-
tences. The default ranking is based on the associa-
tion strength of the article for the organism source
(i.e. A. thaliana), sorted in descending order. The
structured result table page provides the document
identiﬁer (PMID) from which the evidence sentence
has been derived, the extracted sentence text show-
ing the color highlighted user query term as well as
the relevance of the sentence for multiple biological
topics: cell cycle, gene regulation, protein interac-
tion, cellular location, ﬂowering, leaf development,
root development and seed development. Additional
external links to other resources are also included,
namely the BioCreative metaserver, iHOP,
WikiGene and TAIR. In the results page, color-
coded scores are given for each category represented
visually by a unique informative glyph. Scores
above classiﬁer cutoﬀ are displayed in green, other-
wise in red. The evidence sentences can be dynam-
ically reranked for each of the categories, and to
facilitate rapid visual cueing of the association
between the scores and their class, a
background-coloring schema was used.
(ii) PLAN2L also facilitates retrieval of physical inter-
action associations for a given query protein or pro-
tein identiﬁer. Each of the co-mentioned proteins is
returned together with its corresponding identiﬁer,
interaction evidence sentence and experimental
interaction detection method keywords. Ranking
of the interaction association evidence sentences is
based on the corresponding interaction sentence
classiﬁer score.
(iii) In case of regulatory associations, the typical user-
speciﬁed query consists in a protein/gene name or in
which the system returns a tabular regulation evi-
dence summary. To facilitate the interpretation of
the directionality of a given regulatory event, a
color-coding strategy was used to highlight the reg-
ulator and regulated gene, together with a key sen-
tence display. To qualify the type of regulation,
PLAN2L labels each regulation evidence as activa-
tion, repression or undeﬁned (for unclear cases).

(iv) The sub-cellular location evidence sentences for a
given protein can also be retrieved by PLAN2L.
Complementing the location sentence scoring of
the basic search option, more accurate location
sentence retrieval, integrating also location term
co-occurrence and location association words is
available through PLAN2L.
(v) As A. thaliana is one of the most important model
organisms for studying the plant cell-cycle,
PLAN2L integrates a cell-cycle relevance ranking
of PubMed abstracts using a document classiﬁcation
tool. The Arabidopsis literature can be searched
using gene names or keywords and the resulting
abstracts are ranked according to their cell-cycle
relevance (cell-cycle score from the document classi-
ﬁer). Also cell-cycle relevant terms are tagged. The
species ambiguity score of abstracts can be used
to determine how speciﬁc a document is for
Arabidopsis, something useful when several species
are mentioned in the same article.
(vi) In order to enable more eﬀective searches of asso-
ciation evidences existing between two biological
entities of interest, PLAN2L provide the association
retrieval interface, where for two entities entered by
the user, the application returns a set of sentence
where both entities are co-mentioned. Each evidence
sentence is scored according to the biological topics
supported for the basic search query. The default
ranking is based on the interaction sentence classi-
ﬁer scores. The typical time taken for text proces-
sing is 2–3min, but in case of heavy server load
and the actual query type, some jobs might take
between 4 and 5min, upon completion of the
search task PLAN2L displays its results together
with hyperlinks to the resources providing links to
the original article.
Case study: AGAMOUS and LEUNIG
As an example, to illustrate the kind of output generated
by PLAN2L, we searched the system using the
AGAMOUS (TAIR locus AT4G18960). The basic
search for this bio-entity returns a range of descriptive
sentences, Figure 2a shows the ﬁrst of them. Each of
these evidence sentences has a range of associated topic
scores. By looking at the diﬀerent sentences and their
scores, it becomes clear that this gene is important for
the ﬂowering process. This is consistent with information
obtained through cross-checking with existing annotations
reported for this gene, being described in the TAIR data-
base as a ﬂoral homeotic gene that speciﬁes ﬂoral meris-
tem and carpel and stamen identity. When trying to
determine potential interaction partners of AGAMOUS,
by the interaction search facility of PLAN2L, retrieved
hits include the FLOR1-VSP1 complex (Figure 2b).
Regulatory associations of AGAMOUS on the other
side show several hits where this gene is regulated by
LEUNIG and CLF (Figure 2c). Examining the results
more carefully shows that there are cases where the regu-
lation type was correctly labeled as ‘Repression’, but in
other cases PLAN2L could not determine correctly the
actual regulation type, although the directionality (regu-
lator versus regulated gene) was detected correctly. Based
on this regulatory association, LEUNIG, the negative reg-
ulator of AGAMOUS should be a transcription factor
localized in the nucleus. This could be conﬁrmed when
querying the location extraction module with this protein,
obtaining as ﬁrst hit the following evidence sentence:
‘The nuclear localization of LEUNIG-GFP is consistent
with a role of LEUNIG as a transcriptional regulator’
(Figure 2d). In case additional evidence sentences for
the association of AGAMOUS and LEUNIG in terms
of their biological context topic is interesting, for
instance, their association might have an implication
in the ﬂowering process, this can be easily found out
using the association search type. Providing these
two entities as queries results in several association evi-
dence sentences (Figure 2e), and when examining their
corresponding sentence scores for various topics, it
becomes clear that they are in a regulatory association
and that they might have an implication in the ﬂowering
process.
Implementation, user testing and availability
PLAN2L is mainly written in Python and uses the Zope
web application server (www.zope.org) to display the
online results. Some of the protein normalization modules
are implemented in C, and a collection of additional
preprocessing and NLP components are written in Perl.
The sentence classiﬁer component relied on the SVMLight
package. The relational database server is PostgreSQL,
hosts part of the underlying text corpora and lexical
resources. The Zope server runs on a HP 360 G5
Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.40GHz machine with 3GB
de RAM. The initial version of this system (PLAN2L-
aratreg) has been online since 10 January 2007, and has
been improved based on the demands of the EU funded
DIAMONDS consortium. Since the ﬁrst of January 2009,
the system had been tested by over 890 visitors. Individual
user feedback and requests are being collected to improve
the practical usefulness of PLAN2L for the plant science
community. The PLAN2L system is available at: http:
//zope.bioinfo.cnio.es/plan2l. PLAN2L has been tested
on the most common browsers (Firefox, Safari and
Internet Explorer), accounting for 95.88% of the
PLAN2L users. Online help, including documentation
and a tutorial using prerun example cases as well as
additional details on the system evaluation, and user feed-
back (FAQ) are provided together with the online
application.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We described a text mining system, PLAN2L that enables
exploration of literature information at diﬀerent levels of
granularity, from retrieval of gene description sentences
derived from multiple documents, to qualiﬁed biological
relations important to understand the sub-cellular context
and both physical as well as regulatory interaction net-
works of bio-entities. PLAN2L extracts biological infor-
mation from both abstracts as well as full-text articles and

integrates diﬀerent language processing strategies from
simple co-occurrence to syntactic/semantic rule-based
algorithms and supervised machine learning methods.
PLAN2L is intended to be useful for general retrieval,
topic-speciﬁc retrieval as well as for ﬁnding association
evidences for user-speciﬁed entities and for knowledge
and hypothesis conﬁrmation. A similar strategy as used
for PLAN2L can be easily adapted to other model organ-
isms as well as speciﬁc biological topics with minimal
additional manual data preparation.
