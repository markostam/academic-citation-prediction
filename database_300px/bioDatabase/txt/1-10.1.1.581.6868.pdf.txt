ABSTRACT
Long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons com-
prise a significant portion of the rice genome. Their
complete characterization is thus necessary if the
sequenced genome is to be annotated correctly. In
addition, because LTR-retrotransposons can influ-
ence the expression of neighboring genes, the
complete identification of these elements in the rice
genome is essential in order to study their putative
functional interactions with the plant genes. The aims
of the database are to (i) Assemble a comprehensive
dataset of LTR-retrotransposons that includes not
only abundant elements, but also low copy number
elements. (ii) Provide an interface to efficiently
access the resources stored in the database. This
interface should also allow the community to anno-
tate these elements. (iii) Provide a means for identi-
fying LTR-retrotransposons inserted near genes.
Here we present the results, where 242 complete
LTR-retrotransposons have been structurally and
functionally annotated. A web interface to the data-
base has been made available (http://www.retroryza.
org/), through which the user can annotate a
sequence or search for LTR-retrotransposons in the
neighborhood of a gene of interest.
INTRODUCTION
Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous in all eukaryotic
genomes. A particular class of TE, the long terminal repeat
(LTR)-retrotransposon, is the main component of large
plant genomes (1). These elements transpose via mRNAs
through a copy/paste mechanism and therefore have a pro-
pensity to increase their copy number while active. In some
cases, the copy number of a given active element multiplies
to such an extent that it causes genomic expansion (2).
LTR-retrotransposons have thus been shown to be a main
contributor to genome size variation in plants (3). In this
regard, large plant genomes, such as that of maize (2500 Mb)
or that of bread wheat (17 000 Mb) contain over
50% LTR-retrotransposons. On the functional side, LTR-
retrotransposons harbor their own internal promoter as
well as some regions with a strong enhancer activity (both
located in the 50 LTR of the element). Recent reports have
shown that these regulatory sequences can have an impact
on the expression of nearby genes (4). Therefore, the iden-
tification and characterization of LTR-retrotransposons has
become a priority in crop species genome sequencing pro-
jects. Compared to other agronomically important crops,
rice has a relatively small genome (380 Mb). However,
we estimate that >20% of the genome (i.e. 80 Mb) is com-
posed of LTR-retrotransposons. The complete genomic
sequence of rice has been available for more than a year
and its annotation by the international consortium is ongoing
(5). The annotation of all rice TEs and, in particular, of the
LTR-retrotransposons is cumbersome, because it requires a
knowledge of all the various families found in the genome.
Although some repetitive sequence databases exist for rice,
e.g. the TIGR rice repeat database (6) and the Repbase data-
base (7), there is no resource available for the characteriza-
tion of low copy number elements. The full characterization
of these low copy number elements is critical since they are
often mistakenly identified as plant genes by the annotation
pipelines implemented in genome sequencing projects there-
fore leading to an overestimation of gene number (8).
One of the aims of the retrOryza database is thus to provide
the community with free access to the most complete dataset
of rice LTR-retrotransposons. Another goal of the retrOryza
database is to provide the user with a resource for studying
potential gene/LTR-retrotransposons interactions. We pro-
vide a tool in the interface that allows the identification of
LTR-retrotransposons in the vicinity of any of the rice
genes annotated in the TIGR Nipponbare pseudomolecules.
In addition, we provide an interface that allows one to identi-
fy and annotate LTR-retrotransposons in any genomic
sequence. The user can generate such annotation by upload-
ing the sequence in a query form. The output consists of a
GFF formatted file that can be visualized using a text editor
or an annotation browser like Artemis (9).

DESCRIPTION OF THE LTR-
RETROTRANSPOSON DATABASE
Construction of the database
Our database consists of 242 retrotransposon reference mole-
cules from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica), representing pre-
viously described molecules as well as a significant number
of new molecules. Forty-eight retrotransposon sequences,
already characterized and published, were collected from
GenBank. They include those described by McCarthy et al.
(10) (34 osr sequences), Retrosat1, RIRE1 (11) RIRE2 (12),
RIRE3 and RIRE8 (13), RIRE7 (14), RIRE9 (15), RIRE10
(16), Dagul, Hopi and Houba (17), Dasheng (18), Spip and
Squiq (19). All 242 molecules were submitted to an all-
against-all BLAST to identify redundant sequences and con-
tamination due to the insertion of other TEs. RepeatMasker
was used to identify similarities to retrotransposons collected
in RepBase (7) and to mask repetitive sequences.
Based on the results of the above described process, several
of the previously published sequences (osr9, osr10, osr23,
RIRE5, RIRE7 and RIRE10) have been replaced by complete
elements taken from genomic sequences with intact target site
duplications (TSDs) and resubmitted to the cleaning process.
The remaining 194 new retrotransposons were classified
according to their similarity with the already described retro-
transposons. In this way, the elements that possess >90%
overall similarity, at the nucleotide level, to already described
molecules are considered as synonyms. When the sequence
identity is between 70 and 90%, the sequence is considered
to be related to the already described molecule. Any sequence
presenting <70% of sequence identity with a described
sequence is considered as a new retrotransposon. The 194
elements, which correspond mainly to low copy number
retrotransposons, have been classified accordingly generating
24 synonymous sequences, 25 sequences related to already
described retrotransposons and 145 new sequences.
Annotation of the LTR-retrotransposon
reference molecules
All the elements have been annotated for both structural and
functional features. The LTRs were automatically identified
by using a combined approach in which the candidate
sequence is split into two and both halves submitted to
sim4 alignment (20). If no satisfactory result was found, a
Smith and Waterman alignment was performed using the
Water software from the EMBOSS (21) to identify the correct
borders of the LTRs. This approach significantly reduced the
computation time needed to process each molecule, as the
more time-consuming dynamic programming algorithm
(Water) was used only when difficult cases were found.
The primer binding site (PBS), usually located downstream
of the 50 LTR, was identified by similarity searches [NCBI’s
blast tool (22)] against a local database of O.sativa ssp.
japonica tRNA sequences, produced using tRNAscan-SE
(23). Data from similarities between retrotransposons and
30 end of tRNA were automatically evaluated and integrated
into the database. The poly purine tract (PPT) is located
immediately upstream of the 30 LTR. To determine the size
of the PPT we did a nucleotide frequency analysis of the
15 bases upstream of the 30 LTR. We found that purines
were overrepresented from bases 9 to 3 where adenine
and guanine presented a frequency of 20 and 60%, respec-
tively. Base 2 showed a frequency of 54% for adenine fol-
lowed by 27% for guanine while the highest frequency for
base 1 was for thymine with a 32% occurrence.
Annotation of the polyprotein genes was performed using
similarity searches against a local protein databases com-
posed of polyproteins collected from GenBank. We per-
formed a TBLASTX (22) analysis using the retrotransposon
sequences as queries against this database. The results were
filtered and the most significant hit was kept. We used the
PBS, PPT and the polyprotein annotations to correct the
orientation of the LTR-retrotransposon reference molecule.
LTR-retrotransposon annotation in genomic sequences
Most of the tools to annotate retrotransposons are aimed at
masking genomic sequences. Although this approach will
identify pieces of retrotransposons, it does not attempt to
search for complete elements. On the other hand, BLAST
proved not to suit our needs because it produces many
high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) but does not provide a
mechanism to identify the whole element, especially if
there are big indels. This motivated us to develop a tool
that would take advantage of the annotation effort that had
been carried out and therefore from our database of reference
elements.
We developed an algorithm to search for retrotransposons
in the genomic sequences, which is based on BLAST and
uses the reference molecules as queries against the TIGR
pseudomolecules which have previously been cut in 300 kb
contiguous sequences with a 30 kb overlap. The results are
filtered and the original coordinates are assigned to each
HSP. The next step groups the HSPs to identify the retrotrans-
posons. The algorithm will include an HSP in an existing
group if the addition of the matching sequence improves
the representation of the reference molecule attached to the
region, if not, a new group is created. The process is iterated
Figure 1. The 12 pseudomolecules of rice are represented with the
centromere position indicated by a black triangle. Each bucket represents
100 Mb of sequence and the number of hits per bucket is color coded as
indicated in the legend.

until all HSPs are assigned to a group or to its own single hit
group. TSDs are then searched by extracting six bases flank-
ing the putative element and the matching bases are counted.
The TSDs that match over the first five bases are kept.
The parameters that control the grouping and the presenta-
tion of the results are the degree of similarity of the HSP, the
minimum length of the HSP to include, and the minimum size
of the grouped molecule to keep. We have used a minimum
HSP length of 50 bases, 80% similarity and kept the groups
that were >7% of the size of the complete reference retrotrans-
poson represented by the group. With these settings, we found
19 908 groups of which 2433 represent complete elements
whereas 5990 represent regions that span both LTRs and the
internal region but lack well-defined borders. We also found
2886 truncated elements, composed of an LTR and part of
the internal region. Solo LTRs account for 738 groups while
1348 correspond to partial LTRs. Furthermore, we found
5792 groups that represent the internal region but without
flanking LTRs. Although we include some LArge Retrotrans-
poson Derivative elements (LARDs) in the reference mole-
cules, we found 75 putative LARDs (LTRs with an internal
region that has no or limited similarity to the reference
molecule) and 646 truncated LARDs. In total, 77 Mb
(20.6%) of the rice genome match our reference elements.
The percentage of each chromosome that matches LTR-
retrotransposon is as follows: Chr1, 15%; Chr2, 15%;
Chr3, 14%; Chr4, 26%; Chr5, 23%; Chr6, 20%; Chr7, 22%;
Chr8, 25%; Chr9, 23%; Chr10, 25%; Chr11, 22%
and Chr12, 25%. Their overall genomic distibution is
shown in Figure 1.
Figure 2. The database can be browsed through this interface. The widget on the upper right consists of four tabs which are used to present the data to the user.
One opens a tab by clicking on the name of the tab. When localizations are shown, the TIGR localization link can be used to browse the region using Gbrowse.
The complete genome annotation version 4 is available.

DATABASE ACCESS AND SERVICES
We provide access to the database through a web interface
(http://www.retroryza.org/). This interface allows the data
pertaining to individual retroelements to be consulted. Gen-
eral information is presented, which includes the name and
the length of the retrotransposon, the name of the author
that described the molecule, as well as a reference if avail-
able. In the same widget the sequence is presented in a tab
with the option to download it in the FASTA format. Further-
more, an annotation tab is presented where the positions of
the LTRs, the PBS, the PPT or the polyprotein are given
when available. Finally, the comment tab is used to provide
further data on the retroelement (Figure 2).
We used the TIGR rice annotation (release 4) (6) to anno-
tate the retrotransposons. The genomic localizations for a
retroelement are shown on demand by pressing the ‘show
location’ button. In the table (Figure 2), the column named
‘TIGR localization’ shows the genomic location which is
hyperlinked so that the region can be browsed using Gbrowse
(24). The following column, ‘span’, shows the area of the ref-
erence molecule that is represented. The next column shows
the HSPs that comprise the group and is followed by the
region of the reference molecule that is covered. Here
‘lLTR’ represents the 50 LTR, ‘IR’ the internal region and
‘rLTR’ the 30 LTR. When a hit spans a LTR and the internal
region, it is represented by ‘lLTR-IR’ or ‘IR-rLTR’ and when
a HSP covers from the ‘lLTR’ to the ‘rLTR’ it is represented
by ‘lLTR-rLTR’. The last column gives the TSD when one is
found. A graph showing the conservation of the sequence is
also shown. This graph is constructed by accumulating all
HSPs that are longer than 50 bp and possess >90% identity.
One of the services offered in our site is the ability to
search for LTR-retrotransposons in the vicinity of a gene of
interest. The database can be queried with a genomic loca-
tion, a TIGR locus or TIGR gene model identifier. Another
option is offered to the user who can query the database by
searching all gene descriptions for a keyword and selecting
one of the results. The size of the region surrounding the
gene to be searched can be defined from 10 to 60 kb. The
results are displayed on the same page and can be browsed
using Gbrowse.
Another service is the automatic annotation of retrotrans-
posons in a sequence of interest (Figure 3). We use the anno-
tation algorithm described earlier and provide the user with
the possibility of controlling the three parameters that will
influence the sensibility or sensitivity of the annotation tool.
A default of 50/80/100 (minimum HSP length/minimum
similarity percentage/minimum group length to report),
Figure 3. The annotation process consists of uploading a FASTA formatted file to the server which will return a file to the user after the analysis. This file is in
the GFF format which can be opened with a text editor or loaded into an annotation editor such as Artemis.

which will detect most elements similar to the reference
molecules and can be used as a basis for further annotation,
is presented. When using a 50/50/50 setting, the detection
of degenerated borders is improved and weakly related mole-
cules will be better identified. However, these criteria pro-
duce more false positives, i.e. small sequences with low
sequence identity to reference sequences which do not repre-
sent retrotransposons. Although by using a setting of 80/90/
300 will reduce the false positive rate, distantly related ele-
ments will not be detected. Thus the user can impose condi-
tions most suitable to his needs.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
We have generated a rice LTR-retrotransposon reference
molecule database representing 242 elements which have
been structurally and functionally annotated. These reference
molecules have been used to annotate the genomic sequence
of rice. As a result, the search of retroelements inserted near
genes of interest is facilitated. We have also developed an
annotation tool that can be used to identify and annotate
retrotransposons in a sequence. This tool will allow us to
extend our retrotransposon annotation to other species of
Oryza and will provide the foundation for a comparative
study of retrotransposon evolution.
Plans for future development include the integration of
retrotransposon data for other Oryza species. Furthermore,
this database has been developed within the French ANR
ITEGE project which aims to identify retrotransposon-gene
co-transcripts. This project includes several transcriptomic
analyses from plants subjected to various stress. The results
will be implemented in retrOryza when they become avail-
able. We also have made custom microarrays in order to
study the expression of retroelements under stress in order
to correlate them with gene expression. The experiments
have been started and the data will eventually be made avail-
able on retrOryza. Future development of the database will
also include the implementation of the annotation of the
Rice Annotation Project III, as soon as they are publicly
available.
