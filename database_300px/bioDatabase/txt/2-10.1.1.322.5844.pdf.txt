Abstract We examined the ability of erucic acid (22:1n-9)
to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by infusing [14–
14C]22:1n-9 (170 mCi/kg, iv and icv) into awake, male rats.
[1-14C]arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) [intravenous (i.v.)] was the
positive control. After i.v. infusion, 0.011% of the plasma
[14-14C]22:1n-9 was extracted by the brain, compared with
0.055% of the plasma [1-14C]20:4n-6. The [14-14C]22:1n-9
was extensively b-oxidized (60%), compared with 30% for
[1-14C]20:4n-6. Although 20:4n-6 was targeted primarily to
phospholipid pools, 22:1n-9 was targeted to cholesteryl es-
ters, triglycerides, and phospholipids. When [14-14C]22:1n-9
was infused directly into the fourth ventricle of the brain
[intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)] for 7 days, 60% of the
tracer entered the phospholipid pools, similar to the distri-
bution observed for [1-14C]20:4n-6. This demonstrates plas-
ticity in the ability of the brain to esterify 22:1n-9 in an
exposure-dependent manner. In i.v. and i.c.v. infused rats, a
significant amount of tracer found in the phospholipid
pools underwent sequential rounds of chain shortening and
was found as [12-14C]20:1n-9 and [10-14C]oleic acid.
These results demonstrate for the first time that intact
22:1n-9 crosses the BBB, is incorporated into specific lipid
pools, and is chain-shortened.—Golovko, M. Y., and E. J.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD; Online Men-
delian Inheritance in Man 300100) has multiple pheno-
types and is characterized by adrenal insufficiency and
central nervous system demyelination (1). The biochem-
ical hallmark of X-ALD is a marked increase in the amount
of very long-chain saturated fatty acids (VLCFAs), often
hexacosanoic acid (26:0), in plasma (2, 3), adrenal tissue,
and brain (3, 4). Brain cholesteryl ester containing 26:0 is
also increased in X-ALD subjects (3), as is cholesteryl ester
mass (5, 6). The increase in cholesteryl esters results in
reductions in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (6). These
changes in lipid content are associated with a robust in-
flammatory response in the area surrounding the lesions,
but not in nonpathologically involved brain regions (6).
Changes in myelin phospholipids, free cholesterol, or per-
haps an increase in free 26:0 intercalated into the mem-
brane (7) may account for the demyelination observed
in X-ALD.
The underlying mechanism accounting for the increase
in tissue and plasma 26:0 is the decrease in peroxisomal
b-oxidation of lignoceric acid (24:0), permitting its subse-
quent elongation to 26:0 (8–12). Unlike palmitic acid, 24:0
must be activated by the formation of its CoA derivative to
cross the peroxisomal membrane (13); however, lignoceryl-
CoA synthetase activity is reduced in X-ALD, resulting in
limited activation of 24:0 (8, 9). In peroxisomes isolated
from X-ALD-derived fibroblasts, exogenously provided 24:0-
CoA is readily oxidized by peroxisomal b-oxidation, indicat-
ing that peroxisomal b-oxidation is intact (8). Furthermore,
peroxisomal function in X-ALD fibroblasts is normal with
regard to arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) b-oxidation and doco-
sahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) synthesis (14), indicating that
peroxisomal function remains primarily intact.
Using positional cloning, lignoceryl-CoA ligase was found
to be genetically unaltered in X-ALD, but a 75 kDa ABC
cassette protein, adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP; en-
coded for by Abcd1), was genetically altered (15–18). ALDP
is an integral peroxisomal membrane protein (19), with
immunoreactivity absent in nearly 70% of all X-ALD pa-
tients, and it is mutated in all patients examined (20, 21).
Expression of either ALDP or related proteins in fibroblasts
isolated from X-ALD patients increases 24:0b-oxidation and
markedly reduces 26:0 levels to control values (22–26). In
addition to mutations inAbcd1, expression ofAbcd4 andBg1,
genes encoding for a peroxisomal membrane transporter
protein and a VLCFA acyl-CoA synthetase, respectively, is
reduced in normal white matter from X-ALD patients and

is associated with the early pathogenesis and severity of dis-
ease progression (27). Thus, the mutations in Abcd1 as well
as the decreased expression of Abcd4 and Bg1 account for
the tissue accumulation of 26:0 in X-ALD.
Several mouse models for X-ALD have been established
by ablating Abcd1 in mice. These gene-ablated mice have
decreased 24:0 b-oxidation in fibroblasts and increased
levels of 26:0 in plasma and tissue, similar to those ob-
served in X-ALD (28, 29). In these mice, the level of plasma
cholesterol is increased and a high dietary intake of cho-
lesterol exacerbates VLCFA accumulation (30). Although
these mice have the biochemical characteristics of X-ALD,
they lack the robust demyelination observed with this dis-
ease. Rather, the aged, gene-ablated mice demonstrate signs
of adrenomyeloneuropathy (31), a much milder adult form
of the disease associated with progressive demyelination in
the spinal cord. The lack of central demyelination in these
mice may indicate a greater gene redundancy in mice com-
pared with humans, suggesting that proteins related to
ALDP may partially replace the lost ALDP function in these
gene-ablated mice (32).
Lorenzo’s oil therapy was devised after the observation
that X-ALD fibroblasts incubated with monoenoic fatty
acids have reduced 26:0 levels (33), presumably by com-
peting with saturated fatty acids in the elongation pathway
(10, 11). Dietary restriction of saturated fatty acid intake
and ingestion of gycerol trioleate only moderately reduced
plasma 26:0 levels (34, 35). Subsequent studies included
glycerol trierucate in a treatment regimen referred to as
Lorenzo’s Oil (LO) (U.S. Patent number 5,331,009). This
treatment normalized plasma 26:0 levels within 4 weeks
but did not halt neurological deterioration in patients with
advanced X-ALD (36–38). Postmortem analysis of tissue
from these X-ALD patients treated with LO show that
erucic acid (22:1n-9) was absorbed from the gut and found
esterified into liver, adrenal glands, and adipose lipid
pools, but brain levels of 22:1n-9 were not different be-
tween treatment groups (39, 40). These results agree with
the postmortem analysis from a single patient (36) and
experiments in vivo showing that dietary monoenoic fatty
acids do not alter mouse brain fatty acid composition (41).
The lack of increased 22:1n-9 in brains from treated X-
ALD patients suggests limited uptake into the central ner-
vous system, perhaps as a result of poor movement of 22:
1n-9 across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A recent trial
contradicts the supposition that LO is not effective, as it
demonstrates that LO reduces clinical symptoms of X-
ALD when administered early in life (42–44). This sug-
gests that prolonged exposure to LO is clinically benefi-
cial, although this clinical trial does not indicate that
22:1n-9 crosses the BBB; rather, it suggests that 22:1n-9 in
the diet is beneficial in reducing 26:0 in the plasma.
The proposed mechanism of action for LO is supported
by experiments in Drosophila, in which there is an ortholog
to the mammalian microsomal very long-chain acyl-CoA
synthetase (45). When this protein is mutated, it results in
an increase in VLCFA and an age-dependent degeneration
of the optic lobes, which is prevented by feeding LO to the
flies (46). This also supports the human clinical trial indi-
cating that dietary intake of LO limits the onset of neuro-
logical symptoms in afflicted boys.
LO dietary therapy has demonstrated in a number of
clinical trials efficacy in ameliorating peripheral VLCFA
levels associated with X-ALD and now demonstrates strong
potential in limiting central nervous system demyelination
(42–44). Yet, the question regarding the uptake of 22:1n-9
in the brain and its subsequent metabolism and deposition
into brain lipid compartments remains unanswered. To
address this question, we infused rats intravenously (i.v.)
with [14-14C]22:1n-9 and measured brain fatty acid uptake,
deposition, and metabolism. In a parallel set of rats, we
infused the [14-14C]22:1n-9 directly into the brain and
examined its metabolism and deposition into brain lipids.
[1-14C]20:4n-6 was used as a positive control (47–50).
Here, we demonstrate for the first time that [14-14C]22:1n-
9 is taken up by the brain and esterified into brain lipid
compartments. Direct infusion of [14-14C]22:1n-9 alters the
targeting, with more tracer found esterified in the phospho-
lipid pools, suggesting that prolonged brain exposure alters
the targeting of this fatty acid, consistent with the study
demonstrating that early treatment with LO is clinically
beneficial (42–44). In either infusion paradigm, brain [14-
14C]22:1n-9 was partially metabolized to [12-14C]20:1n-9
and then to [10-14C]oleic acid (18:1n-9).
METHODS
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories (St. Louis, MO) and maintained on
standard laboratory rat chow and water ad libitum. This study was
conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (pub-
lication 80-23) and under an animal protocol approved by the
IACUC at the University of North Dakota (protocol 0010-1).
Rat surgery
After a rat was anesthetized with halothane (1–3%), the femo-
ral artery and vein were catheterized with polyethylene tubing
(PE-50). The wound area was anesthetized with xylocaine (1%)
and closed using standard surgical staples. The hindquarters of
the rat were placed in a plaster body cast, and the rat was taped
loosely to a wooden block and maintained postoperatively in a
temperature-controlled environment for 3–4 h.
Tracer preparation
The [14-14C]22:1n-9 was custom synthesized by Moravek Bio-
chemical (Brea, CA), and the structure and position of the 14C
was confirmed by the manufacturer using NMR and mass spectral
analysis. The [1-14C]20:4n-6 was also purchased from Moravek.
Infusate was prepared by taking an aliquot of tracer in ethanol
and evaporating the ethanol under a constant stream of N2 at
508C. Before use, radiotracer purity was assessed by gas-liquid
chromatography and found to be .97% pure for [1-14C]20:4n-6
and .92% pure for [14-14C]22:1n-9. The fatty acid tracer was
solubilized in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer containing “essen-
tially fatty acid-free” BSA (50 mg/ml; Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO). Solubilization was facilitated by sonication in a bath
sonicator for 45 min at 458C. Radioactivity was determined using

liquid scintillation counting and adjusted to 100 mCi/ml. The
appropriate amount of radiotracer was prepared for each rat
using the infusion dose of 170 mCi/kg (51).
Infusion (i.v.)
Awake, adult male rats were infused with 170 mCi/kg [14-14C]
22:1n-9 or [1-14C]20:4n-6 into the femoral vein over 10 min using
a constant-rate infusion paradigm to achieve steady-state plasma
radioactivity. Before and during the experimental period, arterial
blood samples (200 ml) were taken to determine plasma radio-
activity. After infusion, the rat was euthanized using pentobarbi-
tal (100 mg/kg iv). Its brain was rapidly removed and frozen
in liquid nitrogen. The time from pentobarbital injection to
freezing was 35 6 10 s. The tissue was stored at 2808C until used.
Plasma extraction
Arterial blood samples, taken at fixed times during the infu-
sion period, were stored for up to 10 min on ice before separat-
ing the plasma by centrifugation with a Beckman Instruments
microfuge (Fullerton, CA). Plasma lipids were then extracted by
transferring a 100ml aliquot of plasma into a tube containing 2 ml
of chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v), then mixing it by vortexing
(52). The addition of 0.4 ml of 0.9% KCl to these tubes resulted
in two phases. These phases were thoroughly mixed and then
separated overnight in a 2208C freezer. The upper phase was
removed, and the lipid-containing lower phase was rinsed with
0.43 ml of theoretical upper phase, consisting of chloroform-
methanol-water (3:48:47, v/v), to remove any aqueous soluble
contaminants (52). The upper phase was discarded, and a portion
of the lower phase was dried and its radioactivity quantified using
an LS5000 CE liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments).
Blood extraction
Using the same procedure described above for plasma, whole
blood was extracted to correct for residual blood radioactivity left
in the tissue. For the brain, the residual blood was estimated at
2% (50, 53, 54).
Infusion (intracerebroventricular)
For intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion, the rat was anes-
thetized with pentobarbital and mounted in a stereotaxic frame,
with the incisors set 3.3 mm dorsal to the earbars. The skull was
exposed, a small hole was drilled through the skull at 2.5 mm
caudal to lambda at the midline, and an 8 mm long cannula was
inserted 7.5 mm ventral from the dura into the fourth ventricle.
Coordinates and perfusion of the brain’s ventricles were con-
firmed in a separate set of rats by infusing dye and examining dye
distribution postmortem. The infusate was prepared in sterile
artificial saline containing essentially fatty acid-free BSA and [14-
14C]22:1n-9 (170 mCi/kg) under sterile conditions. An osmotic
minipump was placed in the subscapular region, and the fatty
acid was infused over a 7 day period.
Tissue lipid extraction
Frozen tissue was pulverized under liquid nitrogen tempera-
tures. Lipids from tissue powder were extracted in a Tenbroeck
tissue homogenizer using a two-phase system (52). Briefly, the
tissue mass (grams) was multiplied by a correction factor of 1.28
to convert it to an equivalent value expressed in milliliters (55).
This value represents 1 volume. The pulverized tissue was placed
in the homogenizer, and 17 volumes of chloroform-methanol
(2:1, v/v) was added. Tissue was homogenized until there was
a fine particulate-like suspension. The solvent was removed,
and the homogenizer was rinsed with 3 volumes of chloroform-
methanol (2:1, v/v). The rinse was added to the original sample,
and 4 volumes of 0.9% KCl solution was added to this com-
bined lipid extract. After vigorous mixing, phase separation was
facilitated by centrifugation. The upper aqueous phase and pro-
teinaceous interface was removed and saved in a 20 ml glass
scintillation vial. The lower organic phase was washed twice with
2 ml of theoretical upper phase, with phase separation facilitated
by centrifugation between washes. The washes were removed and
combined with the previously removed upper phase. The washed
lower phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids
were redissolved in 3 ml of n-hexane-2-propanol (3:2, v/v) con-
taining 5.5% water.
Aqueous fraction
Radioactivity in the aqueous fraction from the tissue extrac-
tion, including the theoretical upper phase from the two wash
steps, was measured using liquid scintillation counting. Radio-
activity was determined after the addition of 10 ml of Scintiverse
II BD (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) using an LS5000 CE
liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The addi-
tion of the aqueous material to the scintillation cocktail did not
adversely affect the counter efficiency.
Thin-layer chromatography
Phospholipids and neutral lipids were separated by TLC. For
each separation, 100 ml of sample was spotted onto a TLC plate.
Phospholipids were separated on heat-activated Whatman silica
gel-60 plates (20 3 20 cm, 250 mm) developed in chloroform-
methanol-acetic acid-water (60:30:3:1, v/v). This solvent system
resolves cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, and ethanolamine glyc-
erophospholipids but not phosphatidylinositol and phosphati-
dylserine. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were
resolved using heat-activated Whatman silica gel-60 plates (20 3
20 cm, 250 mm) and developed in chloroform-methanol-acetic
acid-water (50:37.5:3.5:2, v/v) (56). Neutral lipids were separated
using heat-activated silica G plates (Analtech, Newark, DE) devel-
oped in petroleum ether-diethyl ether-acetic acid (70:30:1.3, v/v)
(57). This solvent system resolves cholesterol, cholesteryl esters,
diacylglycerols, nonesterified fatty acids, and triacylglycerols.
Lipid fractions were identified using authentic standards (Doo-
san-Serdary, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, and NuChek Prep, Elysian, MN).
Analysis of [14-14C]22:1n-9 metabolism in plasma
and brain
Plasma and brain lipid extracts were fractionated into neutral
lipid and phospholipid fractions using silicic acid column chro-
matography (Clarkson Chemical Co., Inc., Williamsport, PA)
(58). Fatty acids were separated and quantified after conversion
to their corresponding phenacyl esters (59, 60). Briefly, an ali-
quot of lipid extract was subjected to saponification at 1008C
for 30 min in 2% KOH in ethanol, which was then acidified with
hydrochloric acid. The released fatty acids were extracted with
hexane, and phenacyl esters were then prepared by the addition
of acetone containing 2-bromoacetophenone (10 mg/ml) (Sigma)
and triethylamine (10 mg/ml) followed by incubation at 1008C
for 5 min. After the addition of acetic acid (2 mg/ml), the samples
were incubated for another 5 min. Tripentadecanoin (NuChek
Prep) was used as the internal standard.
Individual fatty acid phenacyl esters were separated by HPLC
on a C-18(2) Luna column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The
HPLC system was controlled by a Beckman Instruments 127 sol-
vent module. We modified an existing HPLC method (60) to
resolve VLCFA using a binary solvent system (A, water; B, aceto-

nitrile). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the initial percentage
of B was 80%. At 310 min, the percentage of B was increased
to 90% over 1 min, and at 490 min, it was increased to 96% over
1 min. At 550 min, the percentage of B was returned to 80% over
1 min. The eluent was monitored at 242 nm using a Beckman 166
ultraviolet/visible light detector. Fatty acids were quantified
using a standard curve from commercially purchased standards
(NuChek Prep), and Pentadecanoic acid was the internal stan-
dard. Peaks corresponding to individual fatty acid phenacyl esters
were collected, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scin-
tillation counting using an LS5000 CE liquid scintillation counter
(Beckman Instruments).
Liquid scintillation counting
Bands corresponding to the appropriate lipid fractions were
scraped into 20 ml liquid scintillation vials, and 0.5 ml of water
was added followed by 10 ml of Scintiverse BD (Fisher Scientific).
After mixing, the samples were allowed to stabilize for at least
1 h before being quantified by liquid scintillation counting.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was done using Instat2 from GraphPad (San
Diego, CA). Statistical significance was assessed using Student’s
t-test or one-way ANOVA coupled with the Tukey-Kramer posttest
where appropriate, with P , 0.05 considered significant. n is
defined as the number of rats in a group.
RESULTS
Plasma curves
The plasma curves for [14-14C]22:1n-9 and [1-14C]20:
4n-6 rats are shown in Fig. 1. The integrated area under
the curve for each plasma curve was calculated with Sigma
Plot using the trapezoidal rule. For [14-14C]22:1n-9-in-
fused rats, the average integrated plasma curve area was
2,281 6 835 (n 5 6), whereas for [1-14C]20:4n-6-infused
rats, the average integrated plasma curve area was 2,013 6
378 (n 5 6). These average areas were not significantly dif-
ferent between the groups.
Although [1-14C]20:4n-6 is minimally metabolized in the
plasma during the infusion (61), it is unknown whether
plasma [14-14C]22:1n-9 undergoes significant metabolism.
In plasma, .91% of the infused tracer was found as 22:1n-
9, with only minimal amounts of fatty acids (,1%) derived
by chain elongation or shortening of the [14-14C]22:1n-9
(Table 1). However, we did find 6.5% of the tracer asso-
ciated with stearic acid, with only minimal amounts (,1%)
chain-elongated or -shortened. Because the [14-14C]22:1n-
9 was minimally metabolized into other n-9 family fatty
acids, it is unlikely that the 18:0 represents recycled car-
bon, especially with only 0.3% in palmitic acid; rather,
it more likely represents a contaminant in the custom-
synthesized tracer.
Brain uptake and distribution of 22:1n-9
Rats were infused with [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.v.) to deter-
mine whether this fatty acid readily crossed the BBB, and to
assess its incorporation into brain lipid pools, two separate
infusion paradigms, i.v. and i.c.v., were used. Uptake and
incorporation into the brain was compared with the uptake
and incorporation of infused [1-14C]20:4n-6 (i.v.). For i.v.
infused fatty acids, uptake was corrected for residual blood
remaining in the tissue, as described in Methods. The
amount of tracer extracted from the dose given for each
infusion paradigm and fatty acid was calculated based upon
the dose given to each individual rat. The percentages of
the dose extracted by the brain were 0.011 6 0.004% for
plasma-derived [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.v.), 0.055 6 0.009% for
plasma-derived [1-14C]20:4n-6 (i.v.), and 0.078 6 0.016%
for [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.c.v.). The amount of tracer (nCi/g
wet weight) found in the total, aqueous, and organic frac-
tions was also determined (Fig. 2). Although equal doses

were administered to the rats, 4.7-fold more [1-14C]20:4n-6
entered the brain compared with [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.v),
although when an equal dose of [14-14C]22:1n-9 was in-
fused i.c.v. directly into the brain, there was no difference
between the two fatty acids. No differences in the amount
of tracer found in the aqueous fraction were observed
between groups, although significantly more tracer was
found in the organic fraction for rats infused i.v. with [1-
14C]20:4n-6 or infused i.c.v. with [14-14C]22:1n-9 compared
with [14-14C]22:1n-9.
Distribution of tracer into the organic or aqueous frac-
tions was also determined (Fig. 3). For [14-14C]22:1n-9
infused i.v., there was a marked increase in the distribution
of tracer in the aqueous fraction relative to [1-14C]20:4n-6
(i.v.) or [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.c.v.). In contrast, the distribu-
tion of tracer into the organic fraction was reduced in rats
infused with [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.v.) relative to [1-14C]20:4n-
6 (i.v.) or [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.c.v.). These data demonstrate
the robust use of plasma-derived [14-14C]22:1n-9 for b-
oxidation compared with the long-term exposure of [14-
14C]22:1n-9 via i.c.v. infusion, for which the fatty acid was
b-oxidized to a similar extent as plasma-derived [1-14C]
20:4n-6 (i.v.).
Distribution of radiotracers in brain lipid pools
Tracer distribution into brain lipid pools was also deter-
mined (Fig. 4). Very little of the infused [14-14C]22:1n-9
(i.v.) was incorporated into the phospholipid fraction com-
pared with either the [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.c.v.) or [1-14C]
20:4n-6 (i.v.). However, when infused directly into the brain,
[14-14C]22:1n-9 was found in the phospholipid fraction
nearly 3-fold more than when infused i.v.; although this
distribution was less than for [1-14C]20:4n-6, it was more
similar to [1-14C]20:4n-6 than it was to [14-14C]22:1n-9 in-
fused i.v. In addition, much more [14-14C]22:1n-9 was found
in the cholesteryl ester fraction or in the FFA fraction,
regardless of the infusion paradigm, relative to [1-14C]20:4n-
6. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of [14-
14C]22:1n-9 into brain lipid fractions occurs, although in a
manner that was significantly distinct from [1-14C]20:4n-6,
indicating that the brain does not esterify these two fatty
acids into lipid pools in a similar manner. Nonetheless, con-
stant exposure of the brain to 22:1n-9 significantly altered its
targeting, suggesting some degree of plasticity in the fatty
acid-targeting mechanism(s) in the brain.
Metabolism of [14-14C]22:1n-9 in the brain
To determine whether the infused [14-14C]22:1n-9 was
chain-elongated or -shortened, we determined the distri-
bution of radioactivity found in other fatty acids (Fig. 5).
In both i.v. and i.c.v. infused rats, the bulk of the tracer was

found as [14-14C]22:1n-9, with [12-14C]20:1n-9 appearing
to be an intermediate pool. The terminal pool was found
to be [10-14C]18:1n-9, of which z25% of the tracer was
found. Similar to the results for plasma, there was a small
amount of radioactive 18:0 found in the brain, with a mag-
nitude similar to that observed in plasma. We did not ob-
serve the elongation of [14-14C]22:1n-9 to [16-14C]24:1n-9
in either the i.v. or i.c.v. infused rats. Thus, infused [14-
14C]22:1n-9 undergoes a significant amount of metabolism
within the brain compartment that does not represent
incorporation of these radioactive fatty acids from the
plasma, as they were found in the plasma only in trace
amounts (,1%).
Loss of [14-14C]22:1n-9 to other tissue compartments
To determine whether infused [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.c.v.)
remained primarily in the brain, we analyzed the incor-
poration of this tracer or its metabolites into the liver and
heart organic and aqueous fractions (Fig. 6). When in-
fused i.c.v., the bulk of the infused tracer remained in the
brain compartment, with very little incorporated into the
liver or heart.
DISCUSSION
Although there are other potential therapies for X-ALD,
including treatment with lovastatin (62, 63) and 4-phenyl-
butyrate (32), only LO and bone marrow transplantation
are effective treatments that preserve central nervous sys-
tem myelin and neurological function in boys afflicted
with X-ALD (1, 42, 43). Recent studies demonstrate that
the use of LO in patients is effective (42, 43), but only in
patients without neurological involvement (64). In pa-
tients with neurological symptoms, bone marrow trans-
plantation has proven to be successful (1).
In patients with X-ALD, LO rapidly normalizes plasma
VLCFA and effectively reduces tissue levels of VLCFA,
except in the brain (36–40). These early, limited clinical
trials suggested that 22:1n-9, the active component of LO,
failed to cross the BBB (36, 39, 40), thereby accounting
for the lack of efficacy in limiting the rapid progression of
the demyelination in these patients. However, lack of an
increase in steady-state fatty acid levels is not sufficient
evidence to discount the ability of 22:1n-9 to cross the
BBB. To address this question, we infused rats with [14-
14C]22:1n-9 and measured its metabolism and incorpora-
tion into brain lipid compartments. In a parallel set of rats,
we infused [1-14C]20:4n-6 as a positive control because of
its well-known ability to cross the BBB and to be incor-
porated into brain lipid compartments (47–50).
It is important to note that in this study we measured
the ability of albumin-bound [14-14C]22:1n-9 to enter the
brain, rather than the entry of tracer infused in a triglyc-
eride form, such as that used in LO. This was done for four
reasons. First, others have demonstrated that dietary
22:1n-9 provided in triglyceride form enters the blood
and tissues, including the brain (65, 66). This was further
demonstrated in early studies using LO, in which fatty acid
accumulation in a number of tissues was demonstrated (39,
40). Second, upon digestion of LO, the free fatty acids
and monoacylglycerol will enter the enterocyte, where
these components will be used to form triacylglycerides
and phospholipids, as demonstrated by the dietary uptake
studies. Hence, there will be a rearrangement of the com-
ponents into other molecular species that will be exported
into the circulation. Third, at the level of tissues, includ-
ing the brain, these triglycerides are cleaved by lipoprotein
lipase, thereby releasing the free fatty acid (67). In addi-
tion, under physiological conditions, fatty acids are also
bound to albumin for transport (67). Fourth, in heart, the
infusion of either triglyceride or free fatty acid complexed
with albumin does not affect the kinetics of tracer move-
ment from the plasma into the heart (68–70). The rapid
interchange of fatty acids hydrolyzed from triglycerides
with the free fatty acid pool negates any difference between

these two routes of entry with regard to the kinetics of fatty
acid uptake (69). Similar expectations are that the brain
has a similar inability to distinguish between these two
forms of fatty acid delivery to the brain (67). Thus, here, we
model the physiological process for fatty acid entry into
brain using tracer complexed with albumin to determine
the uptake of 22:1n-9 into the brain.
We clearly demonstrate, using an established infusion
paradigm (47–50), that 22:1n-9 crossed the BBB and was
found in brain metabolic compartments. Although we
could not detect an alteration of plasma concentrations
of 22:1n-9 during infusion (data not shown), the continu-
ing increase in the plasma curve suggests that the plasma
steady-state content of 22:1n-9 was not achieved during the
infusion (Fig. 1), suggesting an undetected perturbation
of plasma 22:1n-9 mass. This was not the case for 20:4n-6,
as it achieved steady state in the plasma. Nonetheless, these
data clearly demonstrate that the magnitude of 20:4n-6
uptake was only 5-fold greater than that for 22:1n-9, in-
dicating that brain has a greater preference for the uptake
of 20:4n-6 over 22:1n-9. In addition, once in the brain,
significant amounts of [14-14C]22:1n-9 were found to be
chain-shortened (Fig. 5), whereas 20:4n-6 is minimally
chain-shortened or -elongated (61). These two points, lim-
ited uptake and the rapid chain shortening of 22:1n-9 upon
entry, may account for the lack of an increase in brain
steady-state 22:1n-9 levels in early clinical trials compared
with other tissues (36, 39, 40).
Once 22:1n-9 entered the brain, it was found distributed
in the organic and aqueous fractions. Compared with 20:
4n-6, much more 22:1n-9 was found in the aqueous frac-
tion, representing b-oxidation, suggesting a differential
targeting of these two fatty acids into brain metabolic pools
(Fig. 3). Introduction of [14-14C]22:1n-9 into the fourth
ventricle, using a continuous infusion paradigm, resulted
in a dramatic shift in the targeting of tracer (Fig. 4). Under
these conditions, the brain esterified nearly 60% of the
tracer into brain phospholipids, with a significant reduc-
tion in the amount targeted to cholesteryl ester or left
in the FFA pool. Overall, the constant infusion of [14-
14C]22:1n-9 resulted in a dramatic shift in the distribu-
tion of tracer in brain lipid compartments, more closely
resembling the distribution of infused [1-14C]20:4n-6 (i.v.)
than the distribution of infused [14-14C]22:1n-9 (i.v.). This
change in the distribution of [1-14C]22:1n-9 suggests a
degree of plasticity in the esterification of this fatty acid
into brain lipid pools. However, it is important to note
that, regardless of the route of entry, the tracer was chain-
shortened to a similar degree (Fig. 5), indicating that the
increase in tracer found in the phospholipids was not
merely an increase in a chain-shortened form of the tracer;
rather, it demonstrates an increased ability of the brain to
activate the 22:1n-9 to the 22:1n-9-CoA for esterification
into brain lipid pools.
Others have demonstrated the ability of diet-derived 22:
1n-9 to enter the brain (65, 66). However, in one of these
studies, the form of the tracer was not identified (65),
whereas the other only measured an increase in mass to
assess incorporation (66). Neither of these studies exam-
ined the potential for the brain to metabolize 22:1n-9,
either into longer or shorter chain n-9 family fatty acids.
When absorbed through the diet, 22:1n-9 is increased
primarily in the heart and adrenal glands (66), which is
consistent with postmortem results from patients given
LO (39, 40). Infusion of [2-14C]22:1n-9 (i.v.) resulted in
limited deposition into brain, which accounted for z2%
of the tracer measured in a number of tissues harvested
6.5 h after infusion via the tail vein (65), compared with
0.03% after dietary consumption of the same tracer (65).
However, it is important to note that the form of the tracer
was not determined in either of these experimental groups.
Here, we determined the incorporation of tracer under
steady-state infusion conditions and verified the incorpora-
tion of 22:1n-9 into brain and its subsequent metabolism
via chain shortening.
It is important to note that we did not find any chain-
elongated [14-14C]22:1n-9. Because LO is thought to com-
pete with endoplasmic reticulum-localized elongases, the
lack of [16-14C]24:1 in the brain suggest that the brain is
ill-equipped to elongate this fatty acid. Clearly, this elonga-
tion occurs in other experimental paradigms in other tis-
sues (10, 33, 39). In human fibroblasts, incubation with
deuterium-labeled 18:1n-9 results in elongation to other
n-9 family fatty acids, and this potential for elongation
is increased in fibroblasts from X-ALD patients (12). In
addition, treatment of patients with LO appears to enhance
the elongation of 22:1n-9, demonstrating an apparent shift
in the ability of fibroblasts from these patients to elongate
fatty acids (12). However, even after the direct exposure of
the brain to [14-14C]22:1n-9 for 7 days, we did not observe
any elongation to [16-14C]24:1n-9, although the impact of
X-ALD on this elongation was not determined using mouse
models (28, 29). Nonetheless, we did not observe any in-
creases in elongation of our tracer, indicating that under
our experimental paradigm, in normal rats this process is
extremely limited.
In summary, we demonstrate that 22:1n-9 readily crosses
the BBB and is esterified into brain lipid compartments.
These studies also demonstrate that the magnitude of up-
take is similar to that of 20:4n-6, although the distribution
among lipid compartments was much different between
the two fatty acids. Constant infusion of [14-14C]22:1n-9
into the fourth ventricle increased the amount of tracer
esterified into lipid compartments and caused a shift in
its distribution into phospholipid pools. Under these
conditions, the distribution was similar to that observed
for [1-14C]20:4n-6 (i.v.), suggesting that during prolonged
exposure, the brain demonstrates plasticity with regard to
targeting 22:1n-9 to phospholipids. The tracer found in
the brain was not accounted for by the entry of metabo-
lized tracer, as the tracer was minimally metabolized in the
plasma. However, within the brain, the tracer was chain-
shortened to 18:1n-9, demonstrating the ability of the
brain to effectively metabolize and esterify the altered tracer.
Thus, 22:1n-9 crosses the BBB, and although the tracer was
significantly esterified into brain lipid pools, it was found
as either 22:1n-9 or its chain-shortened metabolites 20:1n-9
and 18:1n-9.
