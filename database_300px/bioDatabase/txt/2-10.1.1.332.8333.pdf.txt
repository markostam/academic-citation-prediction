Abstract
A detailed genome mapping analysis of 213,636 expressed
sequence tags (EST) derived from nontumor and tumor
tissues of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, and thyroid was
done. Transcripts matching known human genes were
identified; potential new splice variants were flagged and
subjected to manual curation, pointing to 788 putatively new
alternative splicing isoforms, the majority (75%) being
insertion events. A subset of 34 new splicing isoforms (5%
of 788 events) was selected and 23 (68%) were confirmed by
reverse transcription–PCR and DNA sequencing. Putative
new genes were revealed, including six transcripts mapped to
well-studied chromosomes such as 22, as well as transcripts
that mapped to 253 intergenic regions. In addition, 2,251
noncoding intronic RNAs, eventually involved in transcrip-
tional regulation, were found. A set of 250 candidate markers
for loss of heterozygosis or gene amplification was selected
by identifying transcripts that mapped to genomic regions
previously known to be frequently amplified or deleted in
head, neck, and thyroid tumors. Three of these markers were
evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR in an
independent set of individual samples. Along with detailed
clinical data about tumor origin, the information reported
here is now publicly available on a dedicated Web site as a
resource for further biological investigation. This first
in silico reconstruction of the head, neck, and thyroid
transcriptomes points to a wealth of new candidate markers
that can be used for future studies on the molecular basis of
these tumors. Similar analysis is warranted for a number of
other tumors for which large EST data sets are available.

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are common
and aggressive neoplasms, with an estimated annual incidence of
615,900 new cases worldwide (1) and an increasing incidence rate
in many areas of the world (2–4). Thyroid cancer is the most
common neoplasia from the endocrine system with an estimated
annual incidence of 122,800 worldwide. Most of the incidence
variations are probably due to ethnic or environmental factors such
as radiation, dietary habits, or other external factors.
Cancer phenotype is defined by the accumulation of mutations
and epigenetic changes that may alter protein function and/or
cause alterations in transcriptional patterns. These events usually
confer competitive advantages to a cell, ultimately leading to the
malignant phenotype. Transcriptome wide analysis is an important
tool to reveal some of these molecular mechanisms that underlie
human malignancies (5, 6).
To generate a database of transcriptional profiles derived from
tumor and nontumor tissues, a high-throughput cDNA-sequencing
project, based on normalized mini-cDNA libraries generated with
the open reading frame expressed sequence tags (ORESTES)
methodology, was conducted by our group, yielding a set of f1.2
million expressed sequence tags (EST) from diverse human tissues,
from which a filtered set was deposited in public databases (6, 7).
ORESTES sequences are predominantly derived from the central
coding region of genes, thus favoring the identification of gene
function based on protein similarity. In addition, this methodology
partially normalizes the population of tagged genes, enabling the
study of rare transcripts (8). The present study reports on a detailed
informatics analysis of 134,495 ORESTES from head and neck as well
as 79,141 ORESTES from thyroid tissues followed by experimental
validation of new transcripts and new splicing isoforms and by an
evaluation of putative markers for these malignancies.

The criteria for eligibility were determined to insure a good representation
of the transcriptional diversity of the tissues studied. On this basis, selected
patients had to be at least 18 years old and have a histologically confirmed
diagnosis of a non–previously treated (a) oral, pharyngeal, hypopharyngeal,
or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (31 samples) or (b) thyroid
carcinoma, adenoma, or goiter (45 samples). Detailed composition of
samples, in terms of tissue origin and pathologic state, is given in
Supplementary Methods. Tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues were
collected, snap-frozen, and stored; tumor margins that were considered
disease free after histologic examination were used here as nontumor
samples. Before RNA extraction, all pathologic diagnoses were reconfirmed
and samples were macrodissected, reducing nontumor tissues to <20%.
RNA Extraction and ORESTES. PolyA+ RNA was isolated, treated with
DNase and purified as described before, (8) and used for constructing 1,576
ORESTES cDNA minilibraries (8) that were cloned and sequenced (7). The
detailed composition of each of these cDNA minilibraries, in terms of tissue
origin and pathologic state, is given in Supplementary Methods and in
Supplementary Table 1. A total of 1,003 cDNA minilibraries were sequenced,
generating 18,620 sequences from nontumor tissues, 190,253 from tumor
tissues, and 4,763 from thyroid goiter samples; 134,495 sequences were
derived from head and neck and 79,141 from thyroid tissues. mRNA derived
from a second set of tumors and nontumor samples as well as from four
human cell lines (FaDu, Hep2, HeLa, and Siha) was extracted as described
above and used for the experimental validation of new splicing isoforms,
new genes, and potential tumor markers predicted by bioinformatics
analyses.
cDNA Sequence Analyses. A total of 213,636 ESTs generated from head
and neck and thyroid tissues were analyzed along with local copies of the
human genome sequence draft (University of California at Santa Cruz, June
2002) and of the RefSeq and mRNA public data sets (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
The complete set of 1,187,342 ESTs produced in the Human Cancer Genome
Project (HCGP; ref. 7) from more than 20 tissues was filtered to reduce the
presence of low-quality sequences or contaminants, and assembled in
956,456 reads, which included 173,640 sequences derived from head, neck,
and thyroid tissues. The data set was clustered using BLAST (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and assembled with Phrap (http://www.phrap.org).
To further reduce the residual redundancy and to eliminate misassembled
contigs or spurious sequences that passed the filtering step, all contigs and
singlet sequences were aligned to the draft human genome sequence using
BLAT (9). All mapped sequences that exhibited genomic overlap were
merged into a unique genomic cluster. Only sequences that aligned with
>90% identity to the draft sequence through at least 50% of their length were
considered for further analyses. A subset of 119,552 ESTs that were used here
and were not analyzed in previous publications (6–8) were now deposited in
dbEST GenBank under accession numbers CV309219 to CV428770.
Identification of Tissue-Specific Transcriptional Markers. Genes that
were preferentially expressed in certain head and neck sites (oral cavity,
pharynx, and larynx) or thyroid were identified using a Bayesian model, as
described in detail in Supplementary Methods. Using this approach, EST
count thresholds were established to define 95% confidence intervals for the
absence or presence of expression of a certain gene in each anatomic site.
Analysis of New Splicing Isoforms and New Human Transcripts. Four
trained investigators, using the same criteria, visually inspected the genomic
mapping of all ESTs with putative new splicing isoforms. For all new
splicings approved by visual inspection, additional data were collected
regarding splicing classification (10), size of the event in terms of
nucleotides involved, donor/acceptor sites, and confirmation of the event
by other cDNA sequences. Reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) and cDNA
sequencing were done to confirm a subset of these new gene isoforms. To
reduce individual variations, isoform validations were done using human
cell lines as well as pooled samples from different patients and topological
locations.
Candidates for new human transcripts were identified by selecting
clusters or single ESTs with no similarity to known human genes, as
determined by BLASTN queries against a complete set of 162,104 human
mRNA full-length sequences deposited in GenBank (cutoff E value =
1015). In addition, clusters and singlets were identified that mapped to a
2.37-Mb region of chromosome 22 (22q11.2), flanking marker D22S421,
previously shown to be deleted in larynx tumors (11). These were selected
for manual annotation, which included sequence alignment with in silico
gene predictions (GeneScan) and comparison with mouse full-length
transcripts and ESTs, using the UCSC Genome Browser (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/). A set of putative new transcripts was validated by
RT-PCR, using pooled mRNAs from nontumor or tumor larynx and further
evaluated in 45 different mRNA samples derived from larynx (14
nontumor and 13 tumor), tongue (9 nontumor and 3 tumor), and tonsil
(4 nontumor and 2 tumor).
Evaluation of Differential Gene Expression. Experimental evaluation
of differential expression was done for a subset of ORESTES contigs mapped
to genomic regions that, according to the literature data, exhibit recurrent
loss of heterozygosity or amplifications in the selected tumors. Three genes
were selected for experimental validation of their differential expression by
quantitative real-time PCR analysis in a GenAmp 5700 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). cDNA was produced from individual tumor and paired
normal adjacent tissue samples from the larynx and oral cavity. To reduce
individual sample variations possibly arising from contamination of normal
tissue with adjacent tumor, the average expression level of each gene in all
normal samples was used as a reference for each tissue examined. For each
patient, fold change of expression was calculated as the ratio between the
individual tumor sample and the average level of normal tissue samples.
Each cDNA sample was analyzed in duplicate reactions using the SybrGreen
PCR Core Reagent (Applied Biosystems), and normalization was done
according to the manufacturer’s instructions using ACTB or GAPDH as the
reference gene.
Web Site. A dedicated Web site was prepared for data analysis, enabling
visual inspection of the assemblies and of their genome map coordinates as
well as searches using keywords, Gene Ontology classification, or
chromosomal location of transcripts detected in head, neck, or thyroid
tumor types under study. The site is publicly available at http://
verjo19.iq.usp.br/java/jsp/head_neck/.
Results and Discussion
Assembly and Mapping the Head, Neck, and Thyroid EST
Dataset. A set of 213,636 EST sequences derived from head, neck
and thyroid tumors was analyzed here, being part of the over 1.2
million ESTs that were generated by the HCGP (7). After filtering
for contaminants, the remaining 173,640 ESTs (81%) were
assembled together with all HCGP sequences as described under
Materials and Methods. This assembly resulted in 32,576 contigs
and 24,434 singlets that were aligned to the draft sequence of the
human genome. All mapped sequences that exhibited genomic
overlap were included in the same genomic cluster, thus reducing
the data set to a nonredundant collection of 48,001 sequences
(contigs plus singlets) grouped into 20,348 genomic clusters
(Table 1). This corresponds to 38% of the total genomic groups
formed by all ORESTES (20,348/53,105), and includes a number of
clusters containing reads exclusively derived from head and neck
(2,712) or thyroid (1,331) tissues.
Patterns of Gene Expression and Tissue Markers. A total of
10,228 distinct RefSeq genes were sampled by at least one EST
derived from head and neck or thyroid, as determined by
merging all nonoverlapping EST clusters that mapped within the
same RefSeq gene sequence. Different amounts of ESTs were
generated from each head and neck or thyroid tissue using
different sets of primers, which preclude a direct assessment of
genes differentially expressed at a distinct topology. Aiming to
normalize these experimental factors, we applied a Bayesian
statistical model (12) to select only EST counts that were

detected within a confidence interval of 95% (see Materials and
Methods). When this statistical model was applied, ESTs
representing exons of 238 RefSeq genes were selected. The
analysis suggested larynx/oral cavity as the most similar pair of
tissues in terms of gene expression, followed by oral cavity/
pharynx and larynx/pharynx (Fig. 1A). The same result was
obtained when EST clusters that mapped to genomic regions
with no RefSeq genes were included in the analysis (not shown).
In addition, the trio larynx/oral cavity/pharynx contains more
genes in common than trios that include thyroid (Fig. 1B). The
238 RefSeq genes that were identified as being differentially
expressed in different topologies may be used as putative
markers for identifying the tissue origin of circulating tumor
cells, as well as for distinguishing primary tumor from
metastatic lesions, a subject that deserves further evaluation.
This analysis revealed genes preferentially expressed in each head
and neck site or in thyroid with statistical criteria, being a source of
tissue-specific candidate markers for HNSCC or thyroid tumors that
may be selected for further validation (list of genes is available as
Supplementary Table 2).
New Genes and Noncoding RNAs. Out of the total of 20,348
genomic clusters containing sequences from head and neck or
thyroid, a significant fraction (25%, i.e., 5,038 clusters) represents
possible new human transcripts because they have no significant
similarities to previously known human genes (see Materials and
Methods). Among these, a small fraction has evidence of splicing
(16%, i.e., 835) and only 507 sequences (10%) have a normalized
ESTscan score (13) >1, which is indicative of high protein coding
potential. Nevertheless, none of them contain known protein
motifs when compared with the PFAM data set. Among these new
coding transcript fragments, 254 were found to map to intronic
regions of RefSeq genes and may represent new coding exons (see
Supplementary Table 3). The remaining 253 map to intergenic
regions and may represent fragments of new human genes (see
Supplementary Table 4).
The remaining 4,531 clusters that represent new transcripts have
a normalized ESTscan score lower than 1; that is, they have a low
coding potential. Remarkably, a large fraction of these (50%, i.e.,
2,251 clusters) map to intronic regions of RefSeq genes (Supple-
mentary Table 5). Whereas some of these may reflect a certain
degree of genomic DNA contamination that might have persisted
even after DNase treatment and polyA+ mRNA selection, it is likely
that most of these ESTs represent bona fide mRNA transcripts. In
fact, recent data showed that similar fractions of intronic and
exonic transcripts are expressed in 47 samples of tumor and
normal prostate, as detected by cDNA microarrays constructed
with ORESTES clones (14).
Recent work describing the transcriptional output of the human
genome points to the existence of a significant number of
noncoding RNA transcripts (15, 16) and that 10% to 20% of human
transcripts might form sense-antisense pairs (17, 18). Furthermore,
comparable fractions of transcriptional activity were detected
within exons or introns of annotated genes, and nearly half of these
intronic transcripts were expressed antisense to their respective
well-characterized introns (16, 19). Although the role of these
antisense intronic noncoding messages in RNA regulation is not yet
fully understood (20), it has been recently shown that intronic
noncoding transcripts expressed antisense to their respective
introns have their expression level significantly correlated to the
degree of tumor differentiation in prostate cancer (14). Identifica-
tion in the present work of a large set of intronic noncoding
transcripts expressed in head-neck and thyroid suggests that
noncoding intronic transcripts may also play an important role in
HNSCC and thyroid tumors.

Significantly, the majority of the new transcripts containing
sequences from head and neck or thyroid (2,832 of 5,038,
i.e., 56%) map to genomic regions previously associated to
HNSCC or thyroid tumors (21). We found 12 putative new
human transcripts mapping to a 2.37-Mb sequence from human
chromosome 22q11-12, a region selected for its involvement with
larynx tumors (11). These include three EST clusters containing
head, neck, and thyroid sequences. All three had their expression
confirmed in larynx by RT-PCR and were further verified by
semiquantitative RT-PCR in 45 different mRNA samples obtained
from pairs of nontumor/tumor tissues (see Materials and
Methods). Positive amplification was obtained in 42 of 45
(LOC91353), 29 of 45 (LOC164615), and 21 of 45 (LOC91355) of
the evaluated samples. Although no evidence for differential
expression between nontumor and tumor samples was observed
for this small set of genes, these results confirm the potential of
this approach to identify new human genes.
New Splicing Isoforms. Genomic alignments of all EST clusters
matching known human genes were visually inspected to evaluate
the presence of putative new splicing isoforms. New events
involving at least 10 nucleotides of deletions or insertions in
previously known genes were considered as putative new splicing
isoforms and were classified according to Wang et al. (10). Presence
of conserved donor/acceptor sites as well as eventual confirmation
of splicing events by other human ESTs or nonhuman transcripts in
the public databases were recorded. A total of 788 new splicing
events were identified in 748 different transcripts (see Supplemen-
tary Table 6).
Among the new splicing events observed here, 86% and 89%
showed the canonical GT/AG donor and acceptor sites, respectively.
The majority (75.3%) of new splicings was due to insertion events
(Table 2). Overall, the most frequent events were exon extensions
at 5V (type II) and insertions at 3V (type III). New splicing events
could be confirmed by other human ESTs from GenBank in 28.6%
of the cases and by sequences from other organisms in 6%.
New splicing isoforms were selected for experimental validation
using a set of mRNAs different from that used for EST generation.
From a total of 34 new splicing isoforms evaluated, the following 23
(68%) were confirmed by RT-PCR in AF5Q31 , CARD8 , CCNL1 ,
CTNNB1 , CTPS , DNMT3A , EWSR1 , MKNK1 , NESHBP, PDCD8 ,
PFDN5 , PORIMIN , PSMD10 , PTK2 , PTPN18 , RABL2A , SMARCA4 ,
SMARCB1 , ST5 , SULF2 , TRIPP11 , TRRAP, and VAV2 . Examples of
four novel splicing events are shown in Fig. 2. Additional examples
are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Many cases of splicing events affecting protein domains
were observed, such as in SMARCB1 , PFDN5 , AF5Q31 , and EWSR1 .
SMARCB1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and is mutated in a
variety of human tumors of diverse tissue origins, including some
very aggressive pediatric cancers (22, 23). The novel exon of
SMARCB1 identified here promotes an in-frame addition of 18 amino
acids to the protein, with an unpredicted effect over its function. In
PFDN5 , the newly identified exon adds 101 amino acid residues (with
putative phosphorylation sites and an amidation site) to the protein.
Interestingly, isoforms of PFDN5 transcripts were detected in
Northern blots by Mori et al. (24) who also showed that this
heterohexameric chaperone protein binds to c-Myc, repressing its
transcriptional activity. The 101-amino-acid insertion may affect
PFDN5 binding capacity and interfere with its ability to repress the
transcriptional activity of c-Myc.
Because the ORESTES database was shown to be enriched with
rare messages (7), splicing variants described here may represent
rare new splicing isoforms related to these tumors. Whereas some
false-negative or positive splicing events may have occurred among
the 788 new splicing events described, our validation rate (68%)
suggests that true events are the majority. Indeed, the set of human
ESTs available in public databases has recently been shown to
provide potential markers for the classification of cancer (25). The
new splicing isoforms reported here contribute to this notion and
warrant further research aimed at the identification of tumor-
specific transcriptional events.
Finding Tumor Markers Using Transcript Analysis. The
complete HCGP data set is composed of a 9.8-fold excess of
tumor-derived sequences. Despite this, a set of 8,988 genomic
clusters exclusively from nontumor tissues sampled in the project
was found. This set probably is enriched in genes down-regulated
during tumor development and progression. Within this set, 270
genomic clusters contained sequences derived from normal head,
neck, or thyroid tissues (the complete list can be searched at the
project Web site). Twenty-three of these contain sequences from
normal head and neck tissues and are of particular interest because
they mapped to regions known to be frequently deleted in HNSCC
(refs. 21, 26–28; Supplementary Table 7). Although we found several
clusters composed exclusively from sequences derived from normal
thyroid, only one of these (R2_CLUSTER_36019) mapped to a region
(17p11) known to be deleted in thyroid tumors (21, 29, 30). Several of
the genes included in this subset have antiproliferative, apoptotic, or
differentiation-induction activities: CASP10 is involved in the
proximal pathway of Fas-mediated apoptosis and is down-regulated
in lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas
(31–33). Two other genes are related to apoptosis: CSEN , a member
of the neuronal calcium sensor family (34), and MAPK8 , which is

important for the induction of apoptosis following stress (35). RGS6
and HHEX are involved in neuronal or thyroid differentiation,
respectively (36, 37), and APRIN is a putative regulator of cell
proliferation (38). Altogether, these observations strongly suggest
that genes with a still unknown tumor suppressor activity in HNSCC
or thyroid cancer will be found within this selected data set of loss
of heterozygosity candidates.
Conversely, clusters exclusively derived from HNSCC or
thyroid tumor tissues suggest oncogenes from genomic regions
amplified in tumors. A set of 3,776 such clusters were identified
(complete lists can be searched at the project Web site),
including 144 that mapped to regions previously described as
frequently amplified in HNSCC (see Supplementary Table 8) and
therefore are the best candidates for further validation. In fact,
12 of these clusters are transcripts from known oncogenes,
whereas another subset of about 30% of these clusters are from
genes of unknown functions. Genes from this list may include
potential antigens that could be used in immunodiagnosis or
immunotherapeutic approaches, as well as tumor markers.
However, due to the biased amount of sequences from tumor
samples in our project, the list of tumor-only EST clusters
identified here should be analyzed with caution.
Three transcripts were further investigated for differential
expression in HNSCC by quantitative real-time PCR in paired
patient samples (eight oral cavity tumors and nine larynx tumors).
Selected genes mapped to genomic regions that were frequently
amplified (ZRF1 and NDRG1) or frequently lost (RAP140) in
HNSCC. ZRF1 mRNA levels were increased in most samples of

larynx (2.4- to 13.4-fold change, 6 of 8 samples, i.e., 75%) and of oral
cavity tumors (1.5- to 2.3-fold change, 5 of 10 samples, i.e., 50%;
Fig. 3A and B). This is in agreement with a previous study that
showed an increase in chromosome 7 and ZRF1 copy numbers in
HNSCC (39). RAP140 exhibited a decreased expression in half of
the patient samples of larynx tumors (1.6- to 8.1-fold change, 4 of
8 samples, i.e., 50%; Fig. 3C). No information is available in the
literature on RAP140 expression or function in tumors. NDRG1
mRNA levels were increased in half of the oral cavity tumor
samples (1.7- to 3.5-fold change, 5 of 10 samples, i.e., 50%; Fig. 3D).
NDRG1 has been referred to be either under- or overexpressed in a
variety of cancers, including lung, brain, melanoma, liver, prostate,
breast, and renal cancers and also in colon adenomas and
adenocarcinomas (40–42). The variability observed in the expres-
sion of cancer-related genes in individual patient samples probably
reflects the biological heterogeneity of HNSCC (43). Nevertheless,
the 50% to 75% validation rate achieved in the present work
indicates that an informative list of possible candidate markers
was generated in this transcriptome analysis, for which further
experimental validation is warranted.
In conclusion, two large projects have engaged in extensive EST
sequencing of human tumor tissues: the Cancer Genome Anatomy
Project led by the National Cancer Institute (44) and the HCGP led
by Fundac¸a˜o de Amparo a` Pesquisa do Estado de Sa˜o Paulo/Ludwig
Institute for Cancer Research (7), providing a very large disease-
oriented transcriptional database that contains an unprecedented
amount of information on expressed human genes. We show here a
detailed analysis of a subset of these data, the head, neck, and
thyroid sequences, documenting its utility in the identification of
new human genes, candidate tumor suppressors/oncogenes, and
highlighting the structure of transcript variants. Although the EST
data have been widely used by the scientific community, we show
that a wealth of additional information remains unexplored and
may be used to further the understanding of cancer biology.
