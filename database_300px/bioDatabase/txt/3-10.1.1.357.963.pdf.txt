ABSTRACT
Archaeal splicing endonucleases (EndAs) are
currently classified into three groups. Two groups
require a single subunit protein to form a homodi-
mer or homotetramer. The third group requires two
nonidentical protein components for the activity.
To elucidate the molecular architecture of the two-
subunit EndA system, we studied a crenarchaeal
splicing endonuclease from Pyrobaculum aerophi-
lum. In the present study, we solved a crystal struc-
ture of the enzyme at 1.7-A˚ resolution. The enzyme
adopts a heterotetrameric form composed of two
catalytic and two structural subunits. By connecting
the structural and the catalytic subunits of the het-
erotetrameric EndA, we could convert the enzyme
to a homodimer that maintains the broad substrate
specificity that is one of the characteristics of het-
erotetrameric EndA. Meanwhile, a deletion of six
amino acids in a Crenarchaea-specific loop abol-
ished the endonuclease activity even on a substrate
with canonical BHB motif. These results indicate
that the subunit architecture is not a major factor
responsible for the difference of substrate specifi-
city between single- and two-subunit EndA systems.
Rather, the structural basis for the broad substrate
specificity is built into the crenarchaeal splicing
endonuclease itself.
INTRODUCTION
Most RNA primary transcripts undergo several proces-
sing steps to become mature and functional. In the case
of tRNA maturation, primary transcripts are trimmed to
have correct 50- and 30-termini, many bases at speciﬁc
positions are modiﬁed according to the tRNA species,
and -CCA-30 terminal sequences are added if they are
lacking (1). In addition, many tRNA genes encode introns
that must be removed by a speciﬁc set of enzymes (2).
In yeast, the ﬁrst step of tRNA intron removal, cleavage
of phosphodiester bonds between an exon and intron, is
performed by tRNA intron endonuclease (2). The enzyme
is composed of four diﬀerent polypeptides: Sen2p, Sen34p,
Sen15p and Sen54p (3). Sen2p and Sen34p possess RNase
activity, and Sen54p is considered to specify the position
of introns by recognizing structural features present in the
tRNA bodies (3,4). The same kind of enzyme is also pres-
ent in human cells (5). However, the human counterpart is
reported to be associated with protein factors essential for
pre-mRNA 30 end processing (5,6). One of the associated
factors is hClp1, which has polynucleotide kinase activity
toward 30-exons of tRNAs and short-interfering RNAs
(7). Recently, mutations in the human tRNA intron endo-
nuclease subunit genes were shown to be associated
with pontocerebellar hypoplasias, representing a group
of neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disorders (8).
In Archaea, the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds
between an exon and intron is processed by a splicing
endonuclease (2,9), which is also involved in intron

removal in rRNA (10). Furthermore, the enzyme is con-
sidered to be involved in removal of mRNA introns
(11,12) and rRNA maturation (13–16) through recogni-
tion of a bulge–helix–bulge (BHB) motif composed of a
couple of 3-nt bulges split by a 4-bp helix (2,9). Subunits in
eucaryal tRNA intron endonuclease and archaeal splicing
endonuclease have a common ancestor (17,18).
The archaeal splicing endonucleases (EndAs) can be
classiﬁed into three types according to their subunit struc-
tures (9). Homotetramers (a4) consist of four identical
polypeptides with a molecular mass of 18 000–20 000.
Homodimers (a2) are composed of two identical polypep-
tides with a molecular mass of 30 000–45 000. The X-ray
structures for these two types have been solved (19–21).
A comparison of the structures reveals that the gene for
the homodimeric enzyme appears to have been formed by
duplication of the endA gene of the homotetramer type,
and the duplicated genes fused to make one large subunit
(20). Then, the N-terminal domain lost amino acid resi-
dues required for RNase activity. The third type, a hetero-
tetramer (a2b2), was recently discovered by several groups
(22–25). Enzymes of this type consist of two sets of two
polypeptides, namely the catalytic (a) and structural (b)
subunits. However, there was no conclusive evidence that
they adopt a heterotetrameric subunit structure. In the
present study, we elucidated an X-ray structure for a
splicing endonuclease from crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum
aerophilum (PAE-EndA), which requires two polypeptides
for its activity. Based on the structure, we could convert
the enzyme to a homodimer by connecting the structural
and catalytic subunits without losing the broad substrate
speciﬁcity that is one of the characteristics of the hetero-
tetrameric splicing endonuclease. On the other hand,
a deletion of six amino acid residues in a Crenarchaea-
speciﬁc loop abolished the endonuclease activity even on
a substrate with the canonical BHB motif.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of expression plasmids
Cells of P. aerophilum P1 (Japan Collection of Micro-
organisms accession number: 9630) were propagated
according to the supplier’s instructions. The cell lysate
was used as a DNA source for the PCR template. DNA
fragments encoding PAE2269 (catalytic subunit) protein
and PAE0789 (structural subunit) protein were ampliﬁed
by PCR with the primers (PAE2269-F+PAE2269-R,
and PAE0789-F + PAE0789-R, respectively) listed in
Table S1. The PAE0789 coding sequence was cloned
into pET15b (Novagen) between the NdeI and BamHI
sites in the vector to obtain pET15b-PAE0789.
To construct an expression plasmid that simultaneously
expresses the two proteins in a single cell, we ﬁrst cloned
a DNA fragment encoding the catalytic subunit protein
in between the NdeI and BglII restriction sites of
pETDuet-1 (Novagen), called pETDuet-PAE2269. Next,
the 6His-tag coding region in pET15b followed by
the PAE0789 open reading frame sequence was ampli-
ﬁed from pET15b-PAE0789 with pETupstream and
pETterminator primers (Table S1). The ampliﬁed product
was digested with NcoI and BamHI and cloned in between
the NcoI and BamHI sites in the multicloning-site-1 of the
pETDuet-PAE2269 to form pETDuet-PAE-EndA.
To prepare plasmids for expressing linker-connected
variants, PCR reactions (with primer sets in Table S1)
were performed with the plasmid pETDuet-PAE-
EndA as a template. The primer combinations for each
variant are: 0789+None and None+2269 (for NoAA);
0789+LP and None+2269 (for LP); 0789+LP and
E+2269 (for LPE); and 0789+LP and EI+2269
(for LPEI). After the reaction, the ampliﬁed DNAs were
self-ligated to obtain plasmids with linker-connected
protein-coding sequences. To construct plasmids that
express deletion variants, we performed PCR with the
following primer sets (Table S1): PAE2269Del-Fw1 and
PAE2269Del-RV (for Del-1); PAE2269Del-Fw1 and
Del-Rev-1 (for Del-2); PAE2269Del-Fw1 and Del-Rev-2
(for Del-3). Then, the ampliﬁed DNAs were self-ligated.
Expression and purification of PAE-EndA subunits
and complexes
The protein expression protocol was the same as
for Sulfolobus tokodaii EndA subunits (23). First,
Escherichia coli strain Rosetta-gami (DE3) (Novagen)
was transformed with the expression plasmid described
above. A colony was picked up, and the bacteria were
grown in LB broth [1% (w/v) Bacto-tryptone, 0.5%
(w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl] at 378C sup-
plemented with 100 mg/ml carbenicillin and 34 mg/ml
chloramphenicol. When the optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) reached 0.1, isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) was added to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM.
Then, the culture was incubated at 188C for 20 h. After
20 h, a typical culture had an OD600 of 1.0. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10min, washed
and suspended in 1/25 of culture volume of Buﬀer A
[20mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 50mM NaCl]. The cell sus-
pensions were stored at –208C until use.
The following procedures were performed at 48C, unless
otherwise noted. The frozen suspensions were thawed, and
the cells were disrupted by the addition of hen egg-white
lysozyme (ﬁnal concentration, 200 mg/ml) followed by
incubation on ice for 30min. The viscosity of the lysates
was reduced by sonication. Then, the lysates were incu-
bated at 808C for 20min and clariﬁed by centrifugation
(20 000 g for 10min at 48C). To enrich the proteins with
the 6His-tag at their N-termini, the cleared lysate was
mixed with TALON metal-aﬃnity resin (Clontech,
Co2+-chelated agarose) equilibrated with Buﬀer A (15-ml
bed volume of the resin per 1ml lysate). After gentle agi-
tation for 20min at 48C, the mixture was separated into
the resin and supernatant by centrifugation at 700 g for
10min. The supernatant was removed, and the resin
was washed once with 1ml of Buﬀer B [50mM sodium
phosphate buﬀer (pH 8.0), 300mM NaCl] per 15-ml
resin and washed again with 0.5ml of Buﬀer B+10mM
imidazole per 15-ml resin. The protein bound to the
TALON resin was eluted with 0.3ml of Buﬀer
B+150mM imidazole per 15-ml resin. The elution pro-
cess was repeated twice. The eluate was dialyzed against
4788 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 14
Buﬀer C [20mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 750mM KCl, 10%
(v/v) glycerol] and used for further analyses. Protein con-
centrations of the fractions after dialysis and the following
procedures were estimated by measuring the absorbance
of the fractions at 280 nm. An absorbance of 1 was
regarded as 1mg/ml (26).
Gel filtration
The endonuclease protein in the 6His-PAE-EndA frac-
tion isolated through elution from TALON resin in Buﬀer
C was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra 4 (Millipore,
molecular weight cut-oﬀ: 10 000). After the protein con-
centration was adjusted to an 5mg/ml with Buﬀer C,
0.5ml of the protein solution was injected into Superdex
200 10/300 (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buﬀer C
at a ﬂow rate of 0.5ml/min. Fractionation (0.5ml/
fraction; 1min/fraction) was initiated after 15min of injec-
tion. Fractions were subjected to endonuclease assay and
sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis (PAGE) analysis. Activity peak fractions were
used for crystallization experiments.
Analytical ultracentrifugation
Wild-type PAE-EndA and the linker variants at a concen-
tration of 1mg/ml in Buﬀer C were subjected to sedimen-
tation velocity experiments by using an Optima XL-A
analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) equipped
with an eight-hole An50Ti rotor at 208C. The analyses
were conducted at Research Institute of Biological
Science, Katakura Industry Co. Ltd. Buﬀer C was used
as the reference solution. Sedimentation velocity data with
a scanning light of 280-nm wavelength were acquired
at a rotor speed of 50 000 r.p.m. The sedimentation coeﬃ-
cient distribution function, c(s), and the molecular mass
distribution, c(M), were obtained with the SEDFIT
program (version 2008) (27).
SDS–PAGE
Protein samples were resolved on SDS–PAGE with a 15%
separation gel. To visualize protein bands on the gel, the
gel was stained with GelCode-Blue (Pierce), according to
the supplier’s instructions.
Crystallization
Activity peak fractions from gel ﬁltration were pooled and
concentrated to 8mg/ml by using an Amicon Ultra 4
(Millipore, molecular weight cut-oﬀ: 10 000).
Screening for crystallization conditions by the sitting-
drop vapor-diﬀusion technique was performed by using
96-well CrystalClear P Strips (Douglas Instruments).
One microliter of the concentrated 6His-PAE-EndA
protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of res-
ervoir solution, and then the drop was allowed to reach
equilibrium with 100 ml of the reservoir solution. Initial
crystallization conditions for the reservoir solution were
screened at 258C by using Crystal Screen (28), Crystal
Screen II (Hampton Research), and Wizard Screens I
and II (Emerald BioStructures). Out of 194 conditions,
the condition [Crystal Screen No. 50, 0.5M lithium sulfate
monohydrate, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000]
that produced crystals with the best resolution was identi-
ﬁed. For phasing by introduction of platinum, the crystals
were soaked in the reservoir solution supplemented with
2mM K2Pt(NO2)4 for 24 h before being scooped into
a loop.
X-ray data collection and processing
For collecting diﬀraction data, a crystal was scooped into
a nylon loop and soaked brieﬂy in reservoir solution sup-
plemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol and then frozen by
rapid submersion in liquid nitrogen. Diﬀraction data sets
for native crystals (=1.000 A˚) and single-wavelength
anomalous dispersion (SAD) data sets for Pt-introduced
crystals (=1.0718 A˚) were collected under liquid-
nitrogen-cooled conditions of 100K at NW12 of the
Photon Factory Advanced Ring in Tsukuba, Japan, by
using a Quantum-210 detector (Advanced Detector
System Corporation). All data sets were indexed, inte-
grated and scaled by using HKL2000 (29). Native crystal
diﬀracted up to 1.7-A˚ resolution. The crystals belong to
the orthorhombic space group with cell parameters
a= 69.8, b=70.7, c=131.0 A˚, a= b= g=908. There
is one heterotetramer per asymmetric unit. Statistics for
data collection are summarized in Table S2.
Structure determination and refinement
Initial attempts to solve the crystal structure by using
the molecular replacement method with known EndA
were unsuccessful. Therefore, the crystal structure of
PAE-EndA was determined by the SAD method. The
10 platinum sites of PAE-EndA were initially calculated
with SHELEXC/D (30) with the data set collected at the
peak wavelength. Phases were determined in the program
autoSHARP (31) by using the platinum peak data set and
were improved upon solvent ﬂattening with SOLOMON
(32). Automatic model building with ARP/wARP (33)
allowed us to trace about 80% of the residues. Manual
building of the remaining model and further crystallo-
graphic reﬁnement were performed with the COOT pro-
gram (34) and Refmac5 (35). The ﬁnal model (with 443
water molecules) reﬁned to a 50.0–1.7-A˚ resolution has an
R-factor of 21.0% and an Rfree of 25.2%. The ﬁnal model
was checked by PROCHECK (36), revealing good stereo-
chemical parameters with no residues outside of the
allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Statistics for
data collection and reﬁnements are summarized in
Table S2. Graphic representations developed by using
the coordinates were prepared with a PyMOL graphics
system (DeLano Scientiﬁc LLC, Palo Alto, CA, USA.

Splicing endonuclease assay
A typical endonuclease reaction in a total volume of 40 ml
contained 2 mg (0.04 A260 unit) of S. tokodaii tRNA
Trp
precursor (23) or its variant, 8 ml of 5EndA Buﬀer
[100mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), 50mM MgCl2] and 1 ml of
the enzyme fraction in Buﬀer C. The reaction was incu-
bated at 708C for 30min. Then, the RNA was isolated by
phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA
Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 14 4789
was dissolved in FDE [90% (v/v) formamide, 10mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (pH 8.0), 0.02% (w/v)
bromphenol blue, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol] and
resolved by 8.3-M urea/10% PAGE. The RNA bands
were visualized by methylene blue staining.
For comparing speciﬁc activities of the linker variants,
200 000 c.p.m. of [32P]-labeled S. tokodaii tRNATrp precur-
sor was included to the reaction above, and incubated at
608C. Then, 10 ml was withdrawn at each time point. The
reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of FDE
and the product RNA were resolved by 8.3-M urea/10%
PAGE.
For Mini-BHL (37), the substrates were prepared by
transcription reactions by the use of T7 RNA polymerase
and [a-32P]-CTP (MP Biomedicals, 111 TBq/mmole) (23).
In a total reaction volume of 10 ml, the transcript
(15 000 c.p.m.) was incubated with 0.3 mg of EndA protein
at 658C. After the incubation, an equal volume of FDE
was added to the reaction and directly loaded onto an
8.3-M urea/15% polyacrylamide gel.
Radioactivity was detected by exposing the gel to
ImagePlate (Fujiﬁlm) and then scanning the exposed
plate with BAS-2500 (Fujiﬁlm). Radioactive signals
on the scanned images were quantiﬁed by Multi Gauge
software (Fujiﬁlm).
RESULTS
Pyrobaculum aerophilum splicing endonuclease requires
two proteins for its activity
The genome of P. aerophilum (38) encodes two genes
homologous to the endA gene from Methanocaldococcus
jannaschii (39). The open reading frames for the two
proteins were designated as PAE2269 and PAE0789.
We assumed that the two proteins are concurrently
required for splicing endonuclease activity, because this
requirement has been shown for S. tokodaii, Sulfolobus
solfataricus and Nanoarchaeum equitans (22–25). The
PAE2269 protein could be a catalytic subunit because it
possesses conserved histidine that is required for RNase
activity. The PAE0789 protein could be a structural
subunit. To conﬁrm our assumption, we expressed each
protein with an N-terminal 6His-tag in E. coli; then,
we partially puriﬁed the proteins with a metal-aﬃnity
column and examined their splicing endonuclease activity.
We found that the enzyme activity required both open
reading frame products at the same time (Figure S1).
In addition, we found that the two proteins interact with
each other in solution in an unequivocal manner by
attaching diﬀerent epitope-tag sequences at the N-termini
of each protein (Figure S2).
Crystal structure reveals PAE-EndA as a heterotetramer
To understand the nature of PAE-EndA, we conducted
crystallization screens with the endonuclease fraction
after the gel ﬁltration (a typical fractionation pattern is
shown in Figure S3). After the screening, we found that
one reservoir solution [0.5M lithium sulfate monohydrate,
15% (w/v) PEG 8000] gave us crystals with diﬀractions up
to 1.7-A˚ resolution. The crystal structure of PAE-EndA
was determined by the SAD method with Pt-induced
crystal. The ﬁnal reﬁned model has an Rwork of 21.0%
and an Rfree of 25.2% for the resolution range from 50
to 1.7 A˚ resolution, and it has good stereochemical qual-
ity. The reﬁned structure contains all amino acid residues
except for the three C-terminal residues (chain A) of the
protein. Moreover, we could not ﬁt the 20N-terminal
amino acid residues derived from the 6 His-tag
sequences in chains A and C into the electron density
map. The asymmetric unit contains a heterotetrameric
subunit structure, a2b2, composed of two catalytic sub-
units (chains B and D) and two structural subunits
(chains A and C) that are related by a noncrystallographic
2-fold axis (Figure 1A). Puriﬁed PAE-EndA appeared at
the heterotetrameric size on the gel ﬁltration column; this
puriﬁed PAE-EndA had enzymatic activity and an appar-
ent molecular mass of 56 kDa (Figures S3 and 3A). These
results indicate that the heterotetrameric enzyme observed
in the crystal structure is formed in solution.
The heterotetrameric PAE-EndA has a rectangular
parallelepiped-like structure, with approximate dimen-
sions of 60 A˚ 50 A˚ 35 A˚ (Figure 1A). The two dimers
(chains A, B and chains C, D) do not show any signiﬁcant
diﬀerences [the root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of
the Ca 0.697 A˚] except for the N- and C-terminal regions
of the structural subunits (chains A and C, Figure S4).
The structural subunit consists of ﬁve b strands (b1–b5)
and two a helices (a1 and a2, Figure 1B). The ﬁve b
strands form a mixed antiparallel/parallel b sheet (b1-b2-
b3-b4-b5; underlines denote parallel strands) that is
surrounded by two a helices (a1 and a2). The catalytic
subunit consists of seven a helices (a3–a9) and nine b
strands (b6–b14, Figure 1B). In the N-terminal catalytic
subunit, four b strands form a mixed antiparallel/parallel
b sheet (order: b8-b7-b6-b9) that is surrounded by four
a helices (a3–a6). In the C-terminal catalytic subunit,
ﬁve b strands form a mixed antiparallel/parallel b sheet
(order: b10-b11-b12-b13-b14) that is surrounded by three
a helices (a7–a9). Between the structural and the catalytic
subunits, an antiparallel intermolecular b sheet that is
important for dimerization (b5–b14 interaction)
is formed by b5 (structural subunit) and b14 (catalytic
subunit). The C-terminal long loop of the structural sub-
unit extends to the N-terminal of the catalytic subunit
(Figure 1A and 1I).
Comparison with other EndAs
The archaeal splicing endonucleases can be distinctly
grouped into three families: homodimers (a2), hom-
tetramers (a4) and heterotetramers, or dimers of hetero-
dimers (a2b2) (9). Crystal structures of the homodimeric
splicing endonucleases from Archaeoglobus fulgidus
(AFU-EndA; PDB accession number 1RLV) (20) and
Thermoplasma acidophilum (TAC-EndA; PDB accession
numbers 2OHC and 2HOE) (21) have been reported. In
addition, the crystal structure of AFU-EndA in complex
with an RNA substrate has been revealed (PDB accession
number 2GJW) (40). One crystal structure for a homote-
trameric splicing endonuclease, the M. jannaschii splicing

has been reported (19). For heterotetramers or dimers of
heterodimers, two crystal structures for nonfunctional
dimers of the catalytic subunit have been reported: the
splicing endonuclease from S. tokodaii (STO-EndA; acces-
sion number 2CV8) and the splicing endonuclease from
S. solfataricus (SSO-EndA, no structural data is deposited
on PDB) (24).
The splicing endonuclease from P. aerophilum
(PAE-EndA, this work) belongs to the dimers of hetero-
dimers family (a2b2). The subunit interaction is mainly
due to a hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds.
Calculations for subunit interactions are summarized in
Table S3. The interface between the structural and cataly-
tic subunits (between chains A and B, C and D) covers
20% of the total accessible surface of the two proteins
(20% for between A and B, 23% for between C and D).
These values are higher than the values for MJA-EndA
(14% for between A and B as well as for C and D, respec-
tively), probably due to the small size of the structural
subunit in PAE-EndA and the C-terminal extension
of the structural subunit towards the N-terminus of the
catalytic subunit (Figure 1A and 1I). The interface
between the functional units (A+B and C+D) covers
17% of the total accessible area. This value is comparable
to values for MJA-EndA (19%), AFU-EndA (24%), and
TAC-EndA (15%).
For the functional unit, the crystal structure of PAE-
EndA is similar to the structures of other EndAs
(Figure 1C–E). The structure of the PAE-EndA functional
unit (dimer of the structural and catalytic subunits,
chains A and B) aligns well with the monomer structure
of AFU-EndA (chain A of 1RLV, RMSD=1.12 A˚ for
the 141Ca atoms of the catalytic subunit). Superposition
of the Ca atoms of the PAE-EndA functional unit and
TAC-EndA monomer (chain A of 2OHC) gives an
RMSD of 1.99 A˚ for 120 atoms of the catalytic subunits.
When the functional unit of homotetrameric MJA-EndA
(chains A and B of 1A78) was compared with the PAE-
EndA functional unit, the RMSD of the Ca atoms
(157 atoms of the catalytic subunit) was 1.49 A˚. Similar
to other EndAs, the functional unit of PAE-EndA is
formed by a tight interaction between C-terminal regions
of the structural and catalytic subunits, including the
b9–b09-like interaction (for PAE-EndA; b5–b14 interac-
tion) (19,20). Interactions between the functional units
are also conserved, including the structural subunit
L10-loop (for PAE-EndA; L5-loop, between b4 and b5)
interaction with the other catalytic subunit (19,20), but
the loop conformations are diﬀerent from each other
(Figure 1C–E, black allows). There are some structural
diﬀerences between PAE-EndA and other EndAs. PAE-
EndA has a long loop insertion containing a short a4
helix (the loop between a3 and b8). However, the eury-
archaeal EndAs (AFU-, TAC-, and MJA-EndAs) lack
this region (Figure 1C–E, circled in dotted black). This
loop is maintained in a catalytic subunit of STO-EndA
of crenarchaeal origin (dotted black circle in Figure 1F)
when it is superposed on the catalytic subunit of PAE
EndA (RMSD=1.64 A˚ for the 153Ca atoms of the
chain D of the PAE-EndA and chain B for 2CV8).
When amino acid sequence alignment was conducted
among MJA-EndA, catalytic domains of AFU-EndA
(residues 150–305) and TAC_EndA (residues 156–289),
and catalytic subunits of PAE-EndA, STO-EndA, SSO-
EndA and Aeropyrum penix EndA, the amino acid
sequence of the extra loop aligned well among crenarch-
aeal EndA catalytic subunits. However, this part is miss-
ing in euryarchaeal EndAs and makes a large gap in
the alignment. Thus, it is possible that the existence of
the extra loop is common to crenarchaeal EndAs.
Interestingly, when the amino acid residues of the extra
loops at the border of the gap [Figure 1G, D34 and A46
for PAE-EndA (highlighted in green), S34 and S44 for
STO-EndA (highlighted in pink)] were mapped on the
superimposed crystal structures, the positions of the inser-
tion seemed almost identical (Figure 1H). The other
diﬀerence is that the ﬁrst EndA-N subdomain at the
N-terminus of the structural domain of the functional
unit is missing in PAE-EndA (Figure 1C–E, square in
dotted blue).
ENGINEERING PAE-ENDA TO CONVERT TO
A HOMODIMERIC FORM
Figure 1I shows the superimposed X-ray structures for the
interdomain loop region of AFU-EndA, the C-terminal
residues of the structural subunit and the N-terminal resi-
due of the catalytic subunit of PAE-EndA. An interesting
observation about the crystal structure of PAE-EndA
is that the C-terminal residues of the structural subunit
form an extended arm toward the N-terminal residue of
the catalytic subunit. This extension is not observed in
MJA-EndA, and the extension seems to overlap with
the interdomain loop connecting the N-terminal and
C-terminal domain of AFU-EndA. We expected that the
introduction of approximately three amino acid residues
between the C-terminus of the structural subunit
(PAE0789 protein) and the N-terminus of the catalytic
subunit (PAE2269 protein) could connect the two sub-
units without a large change in the mutual organization
of the subunits and could make the enzyme a homodimer.
Therefore, we constructed plasmids that express variant
PAE-EndAs in which the C-terminus of the structural
subunit with 6His-tag (6His-PAE0789) was fused
to the N-terminus of the catalytic subunit (PAE2269 pro-
tein) with the introduction of zero (variant NoAA), two
(-Leu-Pro-, variant LP), three (-Leu-Pro-Glu-, variant
LPE) or four (-Leu-Pro-Glu-Ile-, variant LPEI) amino
acids between the subunits. We selected the introduced
amino acid residues by comparing the missing part in
PAE-EndA with the interdomain loop of AFU-EndA
(Figure 1I). All of the variants could be expressed in
E. coli. However, the variant NoAA could not be recov-
ered as a soluble protein after incubation at 808C (data not
shown). The other variants (LP, LPE and LPEI) could be
expressed and recovered as soluble proteins after the puri-
ﬁcation steps used for the co-expression system proteins
(Figure 2A). Variants that remained soluble were metal-
aﬃnity puriﬁed and subjected to a 15-min time course
endonuclease assay. All variants tested possessed splicing
endonuclease activity toward a substrate with the
4792 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 14
canonical BHB motif, S. tokodaii tRNATrp precursor
(Figure 2B). Then, the amount of accumulation for the
50-exon was measured as shown in Figure 4C. Each vari-
ant exhibited accumulation of the 50-exon with good line-
arity up to 10min. Some diﬀerences could be observed for
their activities. At the 5-min time point, each variant accu-
mulated more 50-exon as compared to the amount of
50-exon accumulated by the wild-type endonuclease
(LP; 1.3-fold, LPE; 2.9-fold, LPEI; 3.6-fold, Figure 2C).
To investigate subunit assembly, the wild-type PAE-
EndA and the variants (fractions after the metal-aﬃnity
fractionation) were subjected to gel ﬁltration analysis
through a Superdex 200 10/300 (GE Healthcare) column.
Retention times of the variants through the gel ﬁltration
column were almost the same as that of the wild-type
endonuclease (29.14min for wild type, 29.14min for LP,
29.18min for LPE and 29.06min for LPEI, respectively,
Figure 3A), indicating the formation of the heterotetra-
meric subunit structure for the wild-type endonuclease
and the homodimeric structure for the variants in solu-
tion. Formation of the heterotetramer for the wild type
and the homodimer for the variants was further conﬁrmed
by analytical ultracentrifugation (Figure 3B). The main
peak of the wild-type endonuclease has a sedimentation
coeﬃcient of 3.85 S with a calculated molecular mass of
55.0 kDa. Meanwhile, the sedimentation coeﬃcient values
of the main peaks for the wild-type endonuclease and the
variants were almost identical (3.84 S with a calculated
molecular mass of 60.4 kDa for LP, 3.85 S with a calcu-
lated molecular mass of 62.0 kDa for LPE, and 3.89S with
a calculated molecular mass of 59.3 kDa for LPEI, respec-
tively). These data also suggest that the engineered linker
variant proteins formed homodimers.
Engineered homodimeric PAE-EndAs retain the substrate
specificity of the heterotetrameric splicing endonuclease
Heteromeric splicing endonucleases can cut substrates
with a noncanonical BHB motif with altered bulge nucleo-
tide numbers (24,25). The two splicing endonucleases from
S. solfataricus and N. quitans used in those experiments
are predicted to possess an EndA-N subdomain in their
structural subunits as judged by the number of amino acid
residues in the subunits. Furthermore, although AFU-
EndA can cleave the substrate with altered bulge nucleo-
tide numbers within the tRNA body with less eﬃciency,
an AFU-EndA deletion mutant of the ‘mature domain’,
which is equivalent to the EndA-N subdomain that is
lacking in PAE-EndA, does not cleave the bulge–helix–
loop (BHL) motif with or without mature tRNA bodies
(37). Therefore, to see if PAE-EndA, which is composed of

structural subunits without the EndA-N subdomain,
can exhibit splicing endonuclease activity on a noncano-
nical BHB-motif within a mature tRNA context, we tested
substrates of S. tokodaii tRNATrp variants with altered
numbers of bulge nucleotides at the 50-exon–intron
boundary (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B, the wild-
type PAE-EndA could cleave only the intron–30-exon
border for the variant without bulge moiety at the
50-exon–intron boundary (lane 0 in WT), resulting in the
appearance of RNA bands for only the 30-exon and
50-exon+ intron. Furthermore, the enzyme did not favor
the 4-nt bulge at the 50-exon–intron boundary (lane 4
in WT) on this substrate, as shown by the remaining
50-exon + intron band and the less intense bands for the
50-exon and intron. Other substrates could be eﬃciently
cleaved, resulting in three RNA bands representing the
50-exon, intron and 30-exon. One interesting observation
is that when the lengths of the products were compared,
the 50-exon and 30-exon remained the same, and the
introns diﬀer in length by one base. This observation

indicates that the endonuclease seemed to measure the
2-nt distance from the 4-bp helix in the modiﬁed BHB
motifs. For linker variant EndAs, the band pattern of
the RNAs was almost identical to that of WT. Thus, the
substrate speciﬁcity is not altered by the change in subunit
organization from heterotetramer to homodimer.
The heteromeric splicing endonucleases possess broader
substrate speciﬁcity than their euryarchaeal homomeric
counterparts (12,24,25,41). An example is the activity
toward Mini-BHL (Figure 4C) shown by Tocchini-
Valentini et al. (37). They found that the splicing endonu-
clease from S. solfataricus could cleave the Mini-BHL
molecule without a tRNA body, whereas homodimeric
AFU-EndA and homotetrameric MJA-EndA failed to
cleave the molecule (37). We used this molecule to assess
the substrate speciﬁcity of the variants. The wild-type
PAE-EndA cleaved the Mini-BHL molecule in an
expected manner (Figure 4D, lane WT). Interestingly,
the homodimeric variants also exhibited the splicing endo-
nuclease activity toward the Mini-BHL molecule, and the
cutting manner was almost identical to that of wild-type
endonuclease (Figure 4D, lanes LP, LPE and LPEI].
These results indicate that the subunit structure of the
crenarchaeal enzyme is not responsible for its substrate
speciﬁcity.
Engineered PAE-EndA without the extra-loop lose the
splicing endonuclease activity
As shown in Figure 1F–H, there is an extra loop that
seemed to be speciﬁc for crenarchaeal EndA catalytic

subunits. In the case of PAE-EndA, the residue numbers
of the loop are D34–A46. To examine the role of the loop
in the splicing endonuclease function, we made PAE-
EndA variants in which parts of the loop are deleted.
The residues deleted were R29-D39 (DEL-1), L31-D39
(DEL-2) and D34-D39 (DEL-3). The variants were
expressed in E. coli and puriﬁed by metal-aﬃnity chroma-
tography. The eluted fractions contained two protein
components (Figure 5A), meaning that the two proteins
formed a complex in solution. Further gel ﬁltration
analysis of these fractions also supported the complex
formation (Figure S5). However, when the splicing endo-
nuclease assay was conducted, we found that all of the
deletion variants lost their activity (Figure 5B). An assay
with ﬁve times more variants did not change the results
(data not shown). It is surprising since that the variants
were not deleted the residues that are needed for RNase
activity. They also lost activity toward substrates with
noncanonical BHB motifs (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Pyrobaculum aerophilum splicing endonuclease forms
a heterotetramer
Previous studies have proved that EndAs from
S. solfataricus, S. tokodaii, and N. equitans require two
proteins for their enzymatic activity (22–25). We used
fractions of E. coli-expressed PAE-EndA collected after
metal-aﬃnity chromatography and gel ﬁltration to
obtain the crystal structure of the enzyme. The crystal
structure unequivocally revealed for the ﬁrst time that
the enzyme forms a heterotetramer.
To date, all of the completed crenarchaeal genomes
encode two distinct genes for homologs of the MJA-
EndA subunit, suggesting that all of the crenarchaeal
species possess a heterotetrameric type of splicing endonu-
clease (42). The reason why the enzyme in Crenarchaea
has a distinctive subunit structure from the enzyme in its
euryarchaeal counterpart has not yet been elucidated.
One possibility is that the enzyme activity is regulated
through the separate regulation of each subunit. As
shown in EndAs for S. solfataricus (24) and S. tokodaii
(PDB accession number: 2CV8), the catalytic subunit can
form a homodimer. However, the homodimers are inac-
tive (23,24 and Figure S1) and require the integration of
the structural subunit into the complex to form active
enzyme. Therefore, by regulating the expression of the
structural subunit, it is possible to regulate enzymatic
activity in the cell. However, we must study the
Crenarchaea gene expression proﬁle of the two proteins
to uncover the biological signiﬁcance of the existence of
the structural subunit.
Lack of EndA-N subdomain in the structural subunit
of PAE-EndA
One large structural diﬀerence of PAE-EndA from the
other known EndA structures resides in the structural
subunit. The structural subunit of the PAE-EndA lacks
the EndA-N subdomain, which is suggested to possess
an electrostatic interaction with the mature tRNA body
domain in AFU-EndA (37). Lack of the subdomain in
PAE-EndA without loss of its enzymatic activity toward
substrates with noncanonical BHB motifs clearly shows
that the subdomain is not involved in substrate binding
and recognition by the crenarchaeal splicing endonuclease.
This observation is in agreement with the fact that some
Crenarchaea are predicted to have structural subunits
signiﬁcantly smaller (90–110 amino acid residues, molec-
ular mass of 11 000) than a subunit of MJA-EndA
(20 000). The enzymes classiﬁed into this category prob-
ably do not require the EndA-N subdomain for their func-
tion. On the other hand, some other crenarchaeal splicing
endonucleases are predicted to have a structural subunit
with a similar size (20 000) as their catalytic counter-
parts. These large structural subunits can be considered
to retain the EndA-N subdomains. It is of great interest

variant DEL-3. The amount of the protein used for the assay was 0.5 mg.
4796 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 14
to examine if the subdomain is required for the functions
of the crenarchaeal enzymes with a large structural
subunit.
Subunit structure is not a determinant of substrate
specificity for the crenarchaeal EndA
It is interesting that the substrate speciﬁcity of the enzyme
toward the bulge-number variants with a tRNA body and
towards the mini BHL without a tRNA body was main-
tained after the conversion of the subunit structure from a
heterotetramer to a homodimer. These results suggest that
the substrate speciﬁcity is not determined by a ﬂexible
subunit co-ordination due to the heterotetramer. Rather,
the broad substrate speciﬁcity is already built into the
whole architecture of the protein itself, as discussed below.
Crenarchaea-specific extra loop is important for
splicing endonuclease activity
We are currently examining the structural basis of the
broad speciﬁcity of the enzyme toward noncanonical
BHB motifs. One strong candidate site is the inserted
extra loop in the catalytic subunit that is not found in
homodimeric or homotetrameric enzymes of euryarchaeal
origin (circled in black dot in Figures 1C–F).
Unfortunately, the deletion variants around the loop lost
splicing endonuclease activity even toward a substrate
with a canonical BHB motif (Figure 5B). However, this
result means that important information for the enzyme is
included in D34–D39 (see DEL-3 variant in Figure 5).
Through the characterization of physical and biochemical
properties of the variants, we are approaching the struc-
tural basis of the broad speciﬁcity of the enzyme.
