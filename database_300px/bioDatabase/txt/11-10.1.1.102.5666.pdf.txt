ABSTRACT
A-to-I RNA editing by ADARs is a post-transcriptional
mechanism for expanding the proteomic repertoire.
Genetic recoding by editing was so far observed for
only a few mammalian RNAs that are predominantly
expressed in nervous tissues. However, as these edit-
ing targets fail to explain the broad and severe pheno-
types of ADAR1 knockout mice, additional targets
for editing by ADARs were always expected. Using
comparative genomics and expressed sequence
analysis, we identified and experimentally verified
four additional candidate human substrates for
ADAR-mediated editing: FLNA, BLCAP, CYFIP2 and
IGFBP7. Additionally, editing of three of these sub-
strates was verified in the mouse while two of them
were validated in chicken. Interestingly, none of these
substrates encodes a receptor protein but two of them
arestronglyexpressed in theCNSandseemimportant
for proper nervous system function. The editing
pattern observed suggests that some of the affected
proteins might have altered physiological properties
leaving the possibility that they can be related to the
phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice.
INTRODUCTION
Site-selective adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA-editing is an
essential post-transcriptional mechanism for expanding the
proteomic repertoire (1). It is carried out by members of
the double-stranded RNA-specific ADAR family predomin-
antly acting on precursor messenger RNAs (2). As inosines in
mRNA are recognized as guanosines (G) by the ribosome in
the course of translation, RNA-editing can lead to the forma-
tion of an altered protein if editing leads to a codon exchange.
ADAR-mediated RNA editing is essential for the development
and normal life of both invertebrates and vertebrates (3–5).
Additionally, altered editing patterns have been found to be
associated with inflammation (6), epilepsy (7), depression (8),
ALS, (9) and malignant gliomas (10). A-to-I editing affects
numerous sites in the human transcriptome, but most of these
are located in non-coding regions (11–15). Three families of
mammalian ADAR substrates in which editing causes amino
acid substitutions were found so far, all of them encode recept-
ors that are expressed in the CNS: subunits of the glutamate
receptor superfamily(16) [see review in (17,18)], the serotonin
5-HT2C-receptor (19) and the potassium channel KCNA1
(20). In all these examples, the amino acid substitutions due
to editing were shown to have a major impact on protein
properties (17–19,21). All of these genes are involved in
neurotransmission, pointing to a central function of RNA
editing in the nervous system (20). A wide range of severe
phenotypic alterations following inactivation of ADAR1 and
ADAR2 has been demonstrated (5,22). However, while the
RNA encoding gluRB seems the primary target responsible
for the phenotype of ADAR2 deficient mice, the targets res-
ulting in the phenotype(s) of ADAR1-deficient mice remain
unknown to this point. In contrast to ADAR2, ADAR1 has a
critical role in several tissues of non-neuronal origin, but the
substrates in these tissues remain to be identified (22). There-
fore, in the past few years, several groups have been trying to
identify additional editing substrates, using both experimental

and bioinformatic methods (15,20,23). Here, we describe a
comparative genomics approach to identify editing events
leading to amino acid substitutions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Multiple alignment
Human ESTs and cDNAs were obtained from NCBI GenBank
version 139 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST). The genomic
sequences were taken from the human genome build
34 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human). Details
of our multiple alignment (MA) model can be found in
Sorek et al. (24).
Details and parameters of the algorithm
In order to identify conserved editing sites, we first produced
exhaustive lists of potential editing sites for mouse and human.
Such potential sites are found by aligning expressed sequences
(ESTs and RNAs) against their respective genomes, and f-
inding positions where the expressed nucleotide differs
from the genomic one. This process has to be done with
some care as most of these mismatches are due to sequencing
errors or problems in the alignment, inclusion of which would
result in an enormous list of useless candidates. We used the
following algorithm to identify ‘true’ events of disagreement
between the genome and the expressed sequences, which
could be either single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) or
editing sites.
The algorithm is based on a probabilistic model for the
various sources of mismatches. It first aligns all available
expressed sequences to the genome and clusters them into
genes. For each gene, it looks for columns in the MA matrix
that include mismatches, and estimates the probability of the
observed nucleotide distribution being caused by either
sequencing and alignment errors, or SNPs and RNA editing.
If the probability for the nucleotide distribution being a result
of sequencing or alignment errors does not exceed the cut-off,
but the probability of an SNP/editing does, the genomic posi-
tion is marked as a true event (i.e. it is assumed being an SNP
or editing site). We mask sequences of low alignment quality
(>10% mismatches), genomic regions where the MA is of low
quality (mismatches in >20% of columns), and all single-letter
repetitions and consecutive mismatches of length 3 or more.
The probability of a sequencing or alignment error at a certain
position is estimated based on the type of the sequence
(RefSeq, RNA or EST) and the quality of the MA at the
genomic region (error probabilities: clean regions—RefSeq:
2e-6; RNA: 8e-5; EST: 3e-3, dirty regions—RefSeq: 5e-6,
RNA: 5e-4, EST: 8e-3, polluted regions—RefSeq: 8e-4;
RNA: 5e-3; EST: 5e-2). The probability cut-off against
which the different model probabilities are compared is
106 divided by the number of supporting sequences. The
prior probability of a two-alleles SNP is 104. Applying
this algorithm to the human and mouse transcriptomes resulted
in two lists of putative SNPs/editing events.
Subsequently, the sites found in the human genome were
aligned against those found in the mouse genome, retaining
only alignments longer than 50 nt with identity levels higher
than 85%, and nucleotide mismatches occurring at identical
positions within the two sequences. We also eliminated
genomic sites that are duplicated in either genome, and
retained only non-synonymous events in the coding sequence.
Experimental protocols
For human sequences, total RNA and genomic DNA (gDNA)
isolated simultaneously from the same tissue sample were
purchased from Biochain Institute (Hayward, CA). In this
work, we used samples of liver, prostate, uterus, kidney,
lung normal and tumour, brain tumour (glioma), cerebellum
and frontal lobe.
The total RNA underwent oligo-dT primed reverse tran-
scription using Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA and
gDNA (at 0.1 mg/ml) were used as templates for PCR reactions.
We aimed at high sequencing quality and thus amplified rather
short genomic sequences (roughly 200 nt). The amplified
regions chosen for validation were selected only if the frag-
ment to be amplified maps to the genome at a single site.
PCR reactions were done using Abgene ReddyMixTM kit
(Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) using the primers and annealing
conditions as detailed in the following. The PCR products
were run on 2% agarose gels and only if a single clear
band of the correct approximate size was obtained, it was
excised and sent to Hy-labs laboratories (Rehovot, Israel)
for purification and direct sequencing without cloning.
For mouse and chicken sequences, poly-A RNA was isol-
ated from brain and liver samples using Trifast (PeqLab,
Germany) and poly-A selected using magnetic oligo dT
beads (Dynal, Germany). Poly A RNA (1 mg) was reverse-
transcribed using random hexamers as primers and RNAseH
deficient M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison,
WI). Genomic DNA from the same samples was isolated
according to Ausubel et al. (25).
First strand cDNAs or corresponding genomic regions were
amplified with suitable primers using Pfu polymerase to min-
imize mutation rates during amplification. Amplified frag-
ments were A-tailed using Taq polymerase, gel purified and
cloned into pGem-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI). After
transformation in E.coli, individual plasmids were sequenced
and aligned using ClustalW.
We used Sequencher 4.2 Suite (Gene Codes Corporation)
for multiple-alignment of the electropherograms (see Supple-
mentary Figure). The extent of A–I editing varies: the level of
the guanosine trace is sometimes only a fraction of the adenine
trace, while in some occasions the conversion from A to I is
almost complete. For each gene tested, we sequenced the
PCR products derived from the three tissues in which the
expression was the highest. The RT–PCR and gDNA–PCR
products of one of these tissues were sequenced from both
ends to ensure the consistency of the resulting electrophero-
grams.
Molecular modeling
The three-dimensional model of human alpha-filamin repeat
22 was modelled on structures of human gamma-filamin
repeat 23 (26 and manuscript in preparation) and on the
repeat 4 the actin cross-linking gelation factor APB120 from
Dictyostelium discoideum (entry codes 1ksr, 1wlh) (27–29).
Repeat 5 was refused by the server due to low sequence

homology, while for domain 6 only the C-terminal part was
accepted and modelled.
The homology modelling servers SwissModel (30), instead
of 3D-JIGSAW (31,32) were used for the purpose. Figures
were prepared with Pymol [DeLano, W. L. (2002) DeLano
Scientific, San Carlos, CA, USA. http://www.PyMOL.org].
RESULTS
In silico, editing may be detected using the large-scale data-
base of ESTs (33) and RNAs, currently holding over 5 million
human records. Editing sites show up when a sequence is
aligned with the genome: while the DNA reads A, sequencing
identifies the inosine in the edited site as G. However, most
such misalignments indicate sequencing errors or genomic
variability due to SNPs, rather than RNA editing. In order to
eliminate these instances, we use the fact that such false-
positive events are not conserved between species. Further-
more, functional editing regions are found to be highly
conserved, due to constraints on the dsRNA structure required
for the editing (20). Thus, we searched for conserved genomic
loci in which an A-to-G mismatch appears in both human and
mouse at the same position. More details on the algorithm are
given in Materials and Methods. Using this approach, after
screening for putative sites affecting the amino acids and
filtering out duplicated genes, we found four novel editing
targets, the RNAs encoding BLCAP, FLNA, CYFIP2 and
IGPFB7, as well as the known editing substrates encoding
glutamate receptor subunits. Interestingly, neither the RNA
encoding serotonin receptor HT2C nor the KCNA1 encoding
RNA were identified in this screen, due to the low representa-
tion of edited sequences covering these genes in the EST
dataset (see Discussion). Our algorithm is designed to find
genomic sites at which the expressed nucleotide diverges
from the genomic one. Such occurrences could be interpreted
as either SNPs or editing, and it is therefore not surprising to
find that all of the editing sites reported here are erroneously
recorded as SNPs in dbSNP (dbSNP ids: BLCAP—
rs11557677; FLNA—rs3179473; CYFIP2—rs3207362;
IGFBP7—rs1133243 and rs11555284). All of these presumed
SNPs have no evidence for genomic polymorphisms, and were
included in dbSNP based on expressed data alone. One there-
fore has to consider the possibility of editing rather than
genomic polymorphism for dbSNP records based solely on
expressed data.
To experimentally validate the predicted editing sites, we
sequenced matching DNA and RNA samples retrieved from
the same specimen, for up to six tissues of human and mouse.
Additionally, brain and liver cDNA and genomic DNA were
sequenced for the chicken FLNA and CYFIP2 genes. We
verified editing events in all predicted substrates in human
and mouse, except for the mouse IGFBP7 gene, which we
failed to amplify successfully. In addition, we verified editing
of CYFIP2 and FLNA in chicken tissues (Figures 1 and 2).
PCR products were either cloned followed by sequencing of
individual clones (mouse and chicken), or sequenced as a
population without cloning (human). When the PCR products
were cloned, the occurrence of editing was detected by com-
paring the sequences of several clones with the genomic
sequence. When PCR products were directly sequenced,
editing was determined by the presence of an unambiguous
trace of guanosine in positions for which the genomic
DNA clearly indicated the presence of an adenosine. In
some cases, where individual clones were sequenced, addi-
tional A/G mismatches were found adjacent to the predicted
site (see Supplementary Material). These additional sites

events, respectively. Similar results for the other two substrates are provided

occurred at a low frequency and were therefore missed by the
search algorithm.
The full-length BLCAP (bladder cancer associated protein)
cDNA contains a complete open reading frame (ORF) encod-
ing a protein composed of 87 amino acids. Comparison of
mouse and human BLCAP genomic loci revealed an intronless
organization of the coding region in both species as well as a
highly conserved structure having 91% and 100% identity at
the DNA (coding region) and protein levels. The function of
this differentially expressed protein is not yet known, but it is
expressed mainly in brain tissues and B cells (34) and appears
to be down-regulated during bladder cancer progression (35).
We identified an editing site within the BLCAP coding
sequence, located at chr20:36 833 001 (here and in what
follows, we use UCSC coordinates on the July 2003 build
of the human genome), inducing a Y!C substitution at the
second amino acid of the final protein. There is a highly con-
served region within the intron, 500 bp upstream of the
editing site, which potentially pairs with the editing region
to form an almost perfect, 48 bp long, dsRNA hairpin structure
(Figure 3). Notably, our experimental results show evidence
for an additional U!C editing site at chr20:36 832 971,
resulting in an L!P substitution (data not shown).
The FLNA (filamin A) protein is a 280 kD (2647 amino
acid) protein that cross-links actin filaments into orthogonal
networks in the cortical cytoplasm (36) and participates in the
anchoring of membrane proteins with the actin cytoskeleton
(37). The resulting remodelling of the cytoskeleton is central
to the modulation of cell shape and cell migration. We iden-
tified one editing site within the FLNA transcript (chrX:152
047 854) resulting in a Q!R substitution at amino acid 2341
in the human and mouse proteins, and 2283 in the chicken
homologue. The human editing region is predicted to form a
32 bp long dsRNA structure with a conserved region within the
intron 200 bp downstream to the editing site. The edited
amino acid lies within the 22nd Immunoglobulin-like domain
of the protein, which has been shown to be important for
interaction with integrin beta (38). The same region binds
to the small GTPase Rac1 (39) involved in cytoskeletal reor-
ganization, which is also known to interact with the
Drosophila homologue of CYFIP2, another target identified
in our screen (40).
The biological consequence of the introduced Q to R sub-
stitution in the FLNA protein remains to be determined. There-
fore, to get a better understanding of how the introduced amino
acid exchange might alter protein function, we attempted to
model the amino acid substitution on available crystal struc-
tures of two related domains. One of these is the 4th repeat of
ABP120 from Dictyostelium, the other is repeat 23 of gamma-
filamin, a close homologue of FLNA. Both available structures
adopt an immunoglobulin-like fold. The amino acid sequence
alignment of human alpha-filamin repeat 22, where the
edited amino acid is located, with human gamma-filamin
repeat 23 shows 41% sequence identity; the sequence align-
ment with the Dictyostelium domain 4 gives 22% sequence
identity, and 20% with domains 5 and 6, which were not used
for modelling studies.
In repeat 23 of gamma-filamin as well as in domain 4 of
ABP120, the position corresponding to the edited Gln2341 in
FLNA is occupied by a Gly residue. In both available struc-
tures, the corresponding Gly resides at the beginning of a long
loop region that connects the first and the second beta-strand.
At its N-terminus, this loop locally adopts a beta-turn structure
in gamma-filamin. Substitution of the polar Gln with the pos-
itively charged Arg in the edited protein requires some local
rearrangements in order to accommodate the long polar side-
chain. Despite higher sequence identity between repeat 23 of
gamma-filamin and FLNA, the local conformation of the loop
hosting the edited site was less suitable as a template for
modelling: the side chain of Arg introduced at position
2341 replacing the resident Gln points towards the core of
the protein, leading to a steric clash. On the other hand, in
domain 4 of ABP120, the edited Arg residue can be accom-
modated easily without major rearrangements (see Figure 4).

signal surpasses the original adenosine signal, but in other tissues it is very
weak. (c) Sequences of individually cloned fragments from matching DNA

the data is shown. A total of eight mouse brain cDNA clones were sequenced

cDNA clones was edited. These results suggest that editing of this site might
be brain specific, in agreement with the data for human tissues presented in the
previous panel. Similar results for the other two substrates are provided as
Supplementary Material.

Obviously, the electrostatic potential of the domain is altered
by the changed amino acid, possibly resulting in modifications
of the interactions with binding partners.
The CYFIP2 (cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2)
transcript encodes a protein of 1253 amino acids. CYFIP2
is a member of a highly conserved protein family found in
both invertebrates and vertebrates. Human CYFIP2 shares
99% sequence identity with its mouse orthologues (41). It
is expressed mainly in brain tissues, white blood cells and the
kidney (34). We identified one editing site within the CYFIP2
transcript (chr5:156 717 703) resulting in a K!E substitution
at amino acid 320 in both the human and mouse proteins.
Editing was also observed at the corresponding predicted
position in the chicken cDNA. We note that while a strong
editing signal was observed for human cerebellar cDNA, only
a residual signal was observed in human lung, prostate and
uterus tissues. This pattern is in agreement with the results in
mouse and chicken: all eight mouse brain clones and four out
of nine chicken brain clones were edited, while none of the
eight chicken liver clones was edited. CYFIP2 is a p53-
inducible protein (42), thus possibly a pro-apoptotic gene.
Interestingly, ADAR1 knockout mice show elevated
apoptosis in most tissues therefore providing a possible link
between the phenotype of these mice and a potential pro-
apoptotic editing target (23). No obvious dsRNA structure
in the CYFIP2 pre-mRNA including the editing region
could be identified, except for a weak, local pairing.
The IGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7)
transcript encodes a protein of 282 amino acids in length, and
is expressed in a wide range of tissues (34). IGFBP7 is a
member of a family of soluble proteins that bind insulin-
like growth factors (IGFs) with high affinity. Their principal
functions are to regulate IGF availability in body fluids and
tissues and to modulate IGF binding to its receptors (43). We
identified two editing sites within the IGFBP7 transcript
(chr4:57 891 828 and chr4:57 891 776) resulting in R!G
and K!R substitutions at amino acids 78 and 95, respectively
(although we had failed to amplify the genomic region of
IGFBP7, editing signals can be seen in the RNA sequences;
see Supplementary Figure). The editing region seemingly
pairs with a region within the coding sequence, 200 bp
upstream of the editing site, to form a 140 bp long dsRNA
structure. In addition, the editing site overlaps with an intron of
an antisense transcript BC039519, pairing with this RNA
could also trigger editing by ADARs (44).
The two edited sites in IGFBP7 map to the insulin growth
factor binding (IB) domain of IGFBP7. The structure of
this modulus from the homologous protein IGFBP5 was
determined in solution as an isolated molecule (45) as well
as in a complex with the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
(46). In this case, the proteolytically stable mini-IGFBP5
construct, which retains high affinity binding to IGF-I, was
used. The amino acid sequence identity between the IB
domains of IGFBP7 and IGFBP5 is 29%. We carried out
a structural analysis of the edited sites using the available
three-dimensional model of the mini-IGFBP5 in complex
with IGF-I.

substrates are given in Supplementary Material. (b) Conservation levels at the editing genomic locus. The two red bars at the bottom mark the editing region and the

The two amino acids corresponding to the edited residues
are not directly involved in binding to IGF-I, but closely flank
the regions involved in binding. The first edited site at position
78 (51 in IGFBP5) is close to the position Val-49 (IGFBP5
numbering) which is involved in an important hydrophobic
interaction with Phe-16 of IGF-I. Val-49 is located in a loop
region. In native IGFBP7, position 78 (51 in IGFBP5) hosts an
Arg, the side-chain of which does not point towards the
complex interface. A non-conservative substitution/mutation
to glycine at this position could introduce additional flexi-
bility and consequent change of the loop conformation,
therefore disturbing the hydrophobic interaction that stabilizes
the complex.
The second edited site 95 (68 in IGFBP5) hosts Lys in
IGFBP5 as well as in IGFBP7, and is solvent exposed. It
makes a couple of non-specific interactions via the aliphatic
part of the side-chain with Glu-38 of IGF-I. In the edited
molecule, this position is occupied by Arg, the long side-
chain of which can maintain these weak interactions.
Notably, the editing site in the FLNA transcript is located
two nucleotides upstream of a splicing site, resembling the
R/G editing site in the gluRB transcript. In addition, seven of
the eight nucleotides around the editing site are identical in the
two substrates. This might suggest that editing and splicing in
both the FLNA transcript and the R/G site in gluRB might be
regulated similarly. The proximity of the editing site in the
glutamate receptor to the splicing site has led to speculations
on a possible link between editing and splicing. Indeed, in vitro
splicing reactions have shown that the presence of ADAR2
inhibits splicing of the R/G site in gluRB RNA (47). Interest-
ingly, analysis of the available EST data shows a positive
correlation between editing of the last codon in the exon of
FLNA and aberrant retention of the following intron, suggest-
ing a link between editing and splicing.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have provided evidence for ADAR-mediated RNA-
editing in four novel coding substrates. While this number may
seem low, we believe that many coding substrates may have
been missed by our algorithm for several reasons: Editing
typically happens in only a fraction of the RNAs transcribed
from a given gene. Since the coverage of expressed sequences
is scarce for many genes, editing sites might be missed in these
cases. For example, we failed to detect the editing of the
serotonin receptor, which is supported by only one edited
human mRNA sequence (accession code AF208053). Simil-
arly, no edited human KCNA1 sequence is found in the data-
base. Also, only some of the editing sites were detected in
GluR transcripts, depending on their EST coverage and the
level of editing in human and mouse. In addition, the search
parameters used here were rather strict, resulting in a small but
accurate set of candidates. Therefore, improvements of the
algorithm, more liberal parameters, and the continuous growth
of the public EST databases will almost certainly lead to the
identification of additional candidate editing sites.
The human proteins affected by ADAR editing found so far
are all neuronally expressed receptors. In addition, ADAR2
knockout mice, as well as adr knockout flies show behavioural
phenotypes (4). Therefore, it was hypothesized that A-to-I
RNA editing has a pivotal role in nervous system functions
(4). Notably, while all four novel substrates presented here do
not encode for receptors, at least two of them have functions in
the CNS. CYFIP2 interacts with the Fragile-X mental retarda-
tion protein (41), as well as with the FMRP-related proteins
FXR1P and FXR2P, and is present in synaptosomal extracts
(41). The Drosophila homologue has also been shown to be
required for normal axonal growth and synapsis formation
(40,48). In addition, our experimental results suggest that
the editing of CYFIP2 is brain specific. Most notably,
FLNA binds a plethora of transmembrane receptors and ion
channels (37). Mutations in FLNA are associated with peri-
ventricular nodular heterotopia, a disorder of neuronal migra-
tion characterized by nodules of heterotopic neurons abutting
the lateral cerebral ventricles (49). The neurological features
of this condition range from asymptomatic state to severe
drug-resistant epilepsy. However, while CYFIP2 seems to
be edited mainly in the brain, editing of FLNA, as well as
BLCAP and IGFBP7 is observed in a broad range of tissues, in
accordance with the expression spectrum of ADAR1. Thus,
while this work provides additional support for the importance
of RNA editing for CNS functions, some of the novel targets
identified here may be involved in different physiological
processes and could thus represent ADAR1 targets (22).
