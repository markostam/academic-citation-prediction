ABSTRACT
Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) gene is an
erythroid-specific transcription factor, whose expres-
sion plays an essential role in erythropoiesis. Our
laboratory has previously defined the human Gfi-1B
promoter region and shown that GATA-1 mediates
erythroid-specific Gfi-1B transcription. By further
investigating the regulation of the Gfi-1B promoter,
here we report that (i) Gfi-1B transcription is negat-
ively regulated by its own gene product, (ii) GATA-1,
instead of Gfi-1B, binds directly to the Gfi-1-like sites
in the Gfi-1B promoter and (iii) Gfi-1B suppresses
GATA-1-mediated stimulation of Gfi-1B promoter
through their protein interaction. These results not
only demonstrate that interaction of GATA-1 and
Gfi-1B participates in a feedback regulatory pathway
in controlling the expression of the Gfi-1B gene, but
also provide the first evidence that Gfi-1B can exert its
repression function by acting on GATA-1-mediated
transcription without direct binding to the Gfi-1 site
of the target genes. Based on these data, we propose
that this negative auto-regulatory feedback loop is
important in restricting the expression level of
Gfi-1B, thus optimizing its function in erythroid cells.
INTRODUCTION
Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is an erythroid-
specific Gfi-family transcriptional factor, which was identified
by low stringency hybridization screening with a partial Gfi-1
cDNA probe (1). Both Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B contain a SNAG
domain that mediates transcriptional repression and a zinc
finger domain at its C-terminus for their DNA binding to
the TAAATCAC(A/T)GCA recognition sequence (1–3).
Expression of Gfi-1B is confined in erythroid lineage cells
and megakaryocytes in human (4,5), whereas Gfi-1 is more
abundant in the lymphopoietic thymus (6–8). So far, p21
(cip1/waf1), Socs1 and Socs3 are known as the target genes
of Gfi-1B-mediated transcriptional repression (1,9). Since
p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor and SOCS family members are
known to suppress cytokine signaling, the functional role of
Gfi-1B is considered to be important in controlling prolifera-
tion of erythrocyte/megakaryocyte-lineage cells. Its import-
ance in erythropoiesis has been further highlighted by gene
targeting experiment showing that Gfi-1B gene disruption
results in embryonic lethality due to loss of red blood cell
formation (10).
Enforced expression experiment in early erythroid progen-
itor cells has shown that Gfi-1B induces a drastic expansion of
erythroblast independent of its SNAG repression domain with
a parallel increase of GATA-2 expression, which is required
for proliferation of erythroblasts (5). On the other hand, a
recent study has shown that Gfi-1B plays a critical role in
terminal differentiation through its transcription repression
function (11). Likely, the function of Gfi-1B in erythropoiesis
is highly dependent on cell stage and the sequence context of
its targeted gene promoter. Despite the differential roles of
Gfi-1B in different stages of differentiation, results of both
studies indicate that elevation of Gfi-1B level alters the pro-
gram of normal erythropoiesis (5,11). However, it remains
unclear how Gfi-1B expression is regulated in erythroid
cells and whether there is a direct relationship between
Gfi-1B and other transcription factor that is involved in
erythropoiesis.
The expression of many eukaryotic transcription factors has
been shown to be auto-regulated positively and negatively
(12–16). In most auto-regulatory cases, a given factor binds
to its own promoter and either activates or represses transcrip-
tion. In this study, we observed negative auto-regulation of
Gfi-1B in K562 cells. By analyzing the sequence of human
Gfi-1B gene promoter region (17), we found the presence of
two tandem repeats of Gfi-1-like sites located at 59/56 and
47/44 relative to its transcription start site. Very recently, a
report has demonstrated that mouse Gfi-1B directly binds to
the Gfi-1 binding sites near the mRNA transcription start site
of the mouse Gfi-1B promoter and is able to auto-repress its
own expression (18). However, here we showed that mutations

in these two Gfi-1-like sites reduced the promoter activity of
the human Gfi-1B promoter in K562 cells, indicating that these
sites mediate transcriptional activation rather than silencing.
By detailed DNA-binding analyses, we proved that GATA-1,
instead of Gfi-1B, is the main transcription factor preferen-
tially binding to these non-typical GATA sites. Furthermore,
we found that the Gfi-1B can form a complex with GATA-1,
by which GATA-1-mediated transcription is repressed by
Gfi-1B. Coincidentally, one recent report also showed that
Gfi-1B forms a complex with GATA-1 and associates with
the myc and myb promoters in mouse erythroleukemic (MEL)
cells. Given the facts that overexpression of Gfi-1B in ery-
throid progenitors induces growth arrest and that expression of
myc and myb is often associated with cell proliferation, they
hypothesized that GATA-1/Gfi-1B is a repressive complex
that suppresses transcription of myc and myb genes (19).
Our results, on the other hand, present the first direct evidence
that transcriptional repression function of Gfi-1B can work
through its interaction with GATA-1 independent of its direct
DNA binding to the gene promoter. Since our previous study
has shown that GATA-1 is a necessary transcription factor for
Gfi-1B expression, the auto-regulatory mechanism observed in
this study reflects that the expression of Gfi-1B and the func-
tion of GATA-1 are mutually regulated in K562 cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U of
penicillin G per ml and 100 U of streptomycin per ml. 293T
cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS.
Preparation of nuclear extracts and gel-shift analysis
Nuclear extracts prepared from K562 and 293T cells and gel-
shift reaction were as described previously (20). Competitive
DNA oligomer, GATA-1 (C-20, Santa Cruz, CA), Gfi-1B
(H-150, Santa Cruz) or FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibody was
added to the nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice prior to the
DNA-binding reaction. After DNA-binding reaction at
room temperature for 25 min, samples were analyzed by
electrophoresis at 150 V for 2.5 h through the nondenatur-
ing 4% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were then dried for auto-
radiography.
Plasmid constructs and site-directed mutagenesis
Two AATC sites at 59/56 and 47/44 within the pro-
moter region were simultaneously mutated to GGTC in the
pGL2-hG (325/+19) using Quick-Change Site-directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). A 3XGATA-T81-Luc reporter
plasmid was constructed by inserting oligonucleotide con-
taining three tandem copies of GATA-1 binding site
(50-GATCAGAAGCTT CACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATA-
ACAGAAAGTGATAATCTGTCGACCGTCGT-30) upstream
of a minimal herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter in
the pT81 luciferase vector (21), which was provided by
A. Iwama (5) (Laboratory of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for
Experimental Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science,
University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo,
108-8639, Japan). Expression vector of Gfi-1B-FLAG, in
which FLAG is tagged at the C-terminus of Gfi-1B, was con-
structed by ligating the PCR DNA fragment spanning the open
reading frame region with the EcoRI/SalI digested pRK5-
FLAG plasmid. To generate the expression vectors of the
wild-type and deleted mutants of Myc-GATA-1, the regions
covering 1–414, 1–199, 1–255 or 1–287 amino acids of
mGATA-1 cDNA were amplified by PCR and inserted to
the XhoI site of plasmid pCS2-MT (provided by Dave Turner,
University of Michigan). The wild-type and deleted mutants of
FLAG-Gfi-1B covering 1–330, 164–330 and 1–137 amino
acids of hGfi-1B cDNA were each subcloned into the KpnI
and XbaI sites of plasmid pCMV2 to generate the pCMV2-Gfi-
1B (wild type), pCMV2-Gfi-1B (N-del) and pCMV2-Gfi-1B
(C-del) constructs. Another deleted mutant construct covering
45–330 amino acids of hGfi-1B cDNA was subcloned into the
HindIII and EcoRI sites of plasmid pCMV2 to generate the
pCMV2-Gfi-1B (DSNAG) constructs. The VP16-Gfi-1B con-
struct was generated by inserting the fragment covering 161–
330 amino acids of hGfi-1B cDNA to the EcoRI site of pVP16
vector. The retroviral vector for expressing Gfi-1B with
C-terminal FLAG-tag was constructed by ligating the coding
region of Gfi-1B-FLAG with the HpaI-digested pS2 plas-
mid. All constructs were verified by dideoxy termination
sequencing.
Retrovirus production and selection of stable cell line
S2 retroviral vectors expressing C-terminal FLAG-tagged
wild-type Gfi-1B was transfected to the packaging cell line
PT67. Stable clones were selected in the medium supplemen-
ted with G418 antibiotic (400 mg/ml). Following propagation
of each clone, viral supernatant from the individual culture
was collected and stored at 80C. K562 cells were infected
with viral supernatant for 48 h. Subsequently, K562 cells were
kept in the medium containing G418 for further selection.
Stable clone was propagated and confirmed by the detection
of FLAG-tagged Gfi-1B in the cell lysates by western blotting
using anti-FLAG antibodies (M2).
Transient-transfection and luciferase assays
We used electroporation for K562 cells transfection as
described previously (17). 293T cells plated on 35 mm dishes
were transiently transfected with a mixture containing 6 mg of
lipofectamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 1 mg of
plasmid DNA. After transfection for 24 h, cells were washed
and lysed in a reporter lysis buffer (0.5 M HEPES, pH 7.8,
0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2), and 50 ml
of the cell lysates was mixed with 50 ml of luciferase assay
buffer (Packard). The luciferase activity was measured with a
luminescence counter (Packard).
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were seeded and transfected with a mixture of lipo-
fectamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and plasmid
DNA. After transfection for 24 h, cells were washed and
lysed in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1%
Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM NaF and
proteinase inhibitors (Sigma). The lysates were centrifuged
at 10 000 g for 5 min and pre-cleared by incubating with
normal mouse IgG and protein A beads for 30 min at 4C. The
supernatants were immunoprecipitated using M2-Ab beads at

4C for 4 h. The beads were then washed four times by the
lysis buffer and the proteins on the beads were separated by
10% SDS–PAGE.
Western blot analysis
Whole cell extracts (50 mg of protein) in RIPA buffer [50 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate
and SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM NaF, 5 mM Na4VO3 and
proteinase inhibitors (Sigma)] were separated on a 10% SDS–
polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane
(Millipore). The anti-GATA-1 (C-20, Santa Cruz) was diluted
at 1:1000, anti-Gfi-1B (H-150, Santa Cruz), anti-b-tubulin
(Sigma) and anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz) at 1:2000, and
anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) at 1:5000, respectively. Enhanced
chemiluminescence detection of the horseradish peroxidase
reaction was performed according to the vendor’s instructions
(PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
RT–PCR assay
Total RNA was prepared for the synthesis of oligo(dT)-primed
cDNA using the superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One
micro liter of cDNA was then amplified using 30 cycles of
94C for 30 s, 60C for 45 s and 72C for 1 min with specific
primers using Fast-Run RT–PCR kit (Protech Technology
Enterprise). PCR products were separated on 10% polyacryl-
amide gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The

RNA interference
The pS2-Gfi-1B-FLAG retrovirus integrated K562 cells
(3 · 106) were electroporated with or without the 100 nM
GATA-1 siRNA (custom SMART pool, hGATA-1,
NM_002049, Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO).
After transfection for 24 h, cells were harvested for the western
blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described
previously (17). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation
were anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-NF-YB (C-20, Santa
Cruz) antibodies. The immunoprecipitated DNA was applied
to PCR using the following thermal cycling program: 95C for
5 min, 32 cycles of 30 s at 95C, 30 s at 52C and 45 s at 72C,
followed by a 5 min extension time at 72C. Thirty percent of
the products were separated by 10% PAGE and visualized
by ethidium bromide staining. The specific primers for the
hGfi-1B promoter were sense primer: 50-GAGTTTTA-
TAAGTTAGAGCT-30 and antisense primer: 50-AAATAGA-
TACTTCTCCTTTTTGC-30. The size of PCR product of
hGfi-1B promoter was 345 bp.
RESULTS
Gfi-1B transcription is down-regulated by ectopic
expression of Gfi-1B protein
To test the effect of Gfi-1B on its own promoter, a plasmid
expressing the C-terminus FLAG-tagged Gfi-1B under the
control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was co-transfected
with the human Gfi-1B promoter-luciferase construct into
K562 cells. As shown in Figure 1A, overexpression of Gfi-
1B-FLAG strongly reduced the Gfi-1B promoter activity to
30% of the control set, while a slight reduction of SV-40
promoter activity was seen under the same transfection con-
dition, indicating promoter-specific repression by Gfi-1B. To
know whether this auto-inhibition can occur under a condition
where Gfi-1B expression level is elevated moderately, we
constructed a retroviral expression vector of Gfi-1B-FLAG
under the control of LTR promoter. K562 cells were infected
by retrovirus generated from the empty and Gfi-1B-FLAG
retroviral vectors containing neomycin resistance gene. Fol-
lowed by clonal selection, G418 resistant clones were pooled
and subjected to RT–PCR and western blot analyses. Since
endogenous Gfi-1B RNA transcript contains a 50-untranslated
region (50-UTR) covering from exon1 to exon2 of the human
Gfi-1B gene (17), we amplified this 50-UTR sequence of endo-
genous Gfi-1B RNA from total cellular RNA by RT–PCR to
distinguish from Gfi-1B-FLAG transcript, which does not
have the 50-UTR sequence and was specifically amplified
by the FLAG primer for detection. In accordance with the
results from the reporter assay, cells stably expressing mod-
erate amount of Gfi-1B-FLAG exhibited a marked reduction of
the expression level of endogenous Gfi-1B transcript as com-
pared with the cells selected from the control virus infection
(Figure 1B). Similarly, the western blot analysis also showed
that endogenous Gfi-1B protein was no longer detectable in
cells expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG (Figure 1C), confirming that
the endogenous Gfi-1B gene in K562 cells is suppressed by
enforced expressed Gfi-1B-FLAG.
The contribution of Gfi-1-like sequences to the Gfi-1B
promoter activity
Since Gfi-1B is known as a transcriptional repressor with a
DNA-binding activity (1,9), we then examined whether the
human Gfi-1B promoter contains typical Gfi-1 binding site.
Sequence analysis of the Gfi-1B promoter has revealed two
potential tandem Gfi-1-like sites (AATC) at 59/56 and
47/44 of the promoter region (Figure 2A). The in vivo
footprint analysis also clearly showed that this region was
well protected in genomic DNA of K562 cells as a contrast
to no protection in that of myeloid U937 cells (data not
shown). It is known that both Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B exhibit
DNA-binding activity to the same consensus sequence
(1,3). If this region were directly recognized by Gfi-1B, it
would be also protected in U937 cells which contain Gfi-1
but not Gfi-1B (22). We then tested whether these two tandem
AATC sequences play a role in negative regulation of Gfi-1B
promoter. The Gfi-1B promoter reporter plasmid containing
mutations of these two sites was constructed. The wild-type
and mutated-type reporters were transfected into K562 cells
for the promoter activity analysis (Figure 2B). Interestingly,
mutation of these two AATC sequences reduced the promoter
activity to 34% relative to the wild-type promoter, indicating

that these two AATC sites act as critical positive, rather than
negative, cis-elements in controlling the Gfi-1B promoter
activity in K562 cells. Overexpression of Gfi-1B significantly
decreased the luciferase activity expressed from the wild-type
promoter, but not the AATC mutated-type reporter,
indicating that these two AATC sites still contribute to the
responsiveness to Gfi-1B-mediated repression. Accordingly,
we speculated that a positive regulator binding to these two
AATC sites may mediate repression effect of Gfi-1B on its
own promoter.
GATA-1 binds to the AATC sites
To examine whether the sequence containing two tandem
repeats of AATC can be recognized by Gfi-1B, we performed
the in vitro DNA gel-shift assay using radio-labeled DNA
fragment covering 70/41 region of the Gfi-1B promoter
sequence. Incubation of this probe with nuclear extract of
K562 cells gave rise to DNA–protein complexes I and II.
These two complexes were abolished by excess amounts of
the unlabeled oligomer (Figure 3A), but not by the oligomer

divided into two parts. One for luciferase activity assay (left panel), and the other were subjected to western blot analysis (right panel) using antibodies against Gfi-1B
(H-150) or b-tubulin. The luciferase activity was normalized by b-galactosidase activity in each sample, and luciferase activity of the Gfi-1B promoter from cells

cells infected by control (pS2) and Gfi-1B-FLAG expression retrovirus were G418 selected and harvested for RNA preparation. RT–PCR assay were performed

Methods. Bottom panel shows the RT–PCR results for detecting endogenous Gfi-1B RNA in reactions containing different amounts of total input RNA from

carrying mutations in two AATC sites, indicating their speci-
ficity to the sequence containing AATC. One retarded com-
plex seen in the assay was indicated to be non-specific,
because various oligomers, including 70/41 of Gfi-1B pro-
moter, GATA, Gfi-1, AP2 and Sp1 consensus sequences, could
also compete for its formation. Excess amount of unlabeled
Gfi-1 oligomer, which contains typical AATC core sequence,
was unable to compete for complex II formation, but with
some capacity of competing for complex I. However, complex
I formation was unaffected by pre-incubation of K562 extract
with specific Gfi-1B antibody. Interestingly, complex II
formation could be supershifted by the specific GATA-1 anti-
body and competed by excess amount of unlabeled consensus
GATA oligomer, while the mutated GATA oligomer with a
deviation of GATA to CTTA was unable to compete for com-
plex II formation. Unlike the denoted non-specific complex,
complex II formation was unaffected by either AP2, Sp1 or
Gfi-1 oligomers. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that
GATA-1 binds to the tandem AATC sites within the 70/41
region. Since complex I could not be competed by the GATA
consensus oligomer, binding of GATA-1 is unlikely to be
involved in this complex formation. Although there is a
third AATC site located on the reverse strand within the
70/41 region, we found that GATA-1 was unable to
bind to the AATC mutated probe, which retains the intact
third AATC sequence on the reverse strand (data not
shown). Nor did mutation of this third AATC site decrease
the Gfi-1B promoter activity expressed in K562 cells (data not
shown). Here, we excluded the possibility that GATA-1 can
bind to the Gfi-1B promoter via the third AATC on the reverse
strand.
Since 293T cells do not express Gfi-1B and GATA-1, we
then ectopically expressed GATA-1 or Gfi-1B-FLAG in this
cell line for nuclear extract preparation and gel-shift assays.
Radio-labeled 70/41 probe formed specific complexes I
and II with nuclear extracts of cells expressing GATA-1.
These two complexes were abolished by excess amount
of unlabeled GATA consensus oligonucleotide but not by
Gfi-1 oligomer (Figure 3B). In contrast, nuclear extract of
cells expressing Gfi-1B was unable to form any specific
7complex with the 70/41 probe (Figure 3C). One complex
formed in these gel-shift assays shown in Figure 3B and C was
denoted non-specific, since this complex could be competed
by various unrelated oligomers when using 293T cell extracts
expressing either Gfi-1B-FLAG or GATA-1 for the assays. To
test whether Gfi-1B protein in this nuclear extract is functional
in binding to the consensus Gfi-1 oligonucleotide, we then
prepared the radio-labeled Gfi-1 consensus oligomer for the
gel-shift assay. As shown in Figure 3D, nuclear extracts of
cells expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG did form specific complex with
consensus Gfi-1 oligomer probe, which could be super-shifted
by the specific Gfi-1B or FLAG antibody and abolished by
excessive amount of unlabeled consensus oligomer. There-
fore, lack of complex formation between the Gfi-1B promoter
probe with extracts containing Gfi-1B protein is not due to that
the Gfi-1B-FLAG protein expressed in 293T cells is defective
in specific DNA binding. Figure 3E showed the ectopic
expression of Myc-GATA-1 and Gfi-1B-FLAG in nuclear
extracts of 293T cells. These gel-shift data led us to conclude
that GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, binds to the AATC sites
within the 70/41 region of the human Gfi-1B promoter.
Both non-typical and typical GATA sites contribute to
GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation of
Gfi-1B gene
Our previous study has shown that in K562 cells GATA-1
binds to the typical GATA-site located at 132/129 of
the Gfi-1B promoter to mediate transcriptional activation
(17). Here, we further compared the contribution of the typical
GATA (G1) site at 132/129 and non-typical GATA sites
(two AATC at 59/56 and 47/44 positions) in GATA-1-
mediated transcription of the Gfi-1B promoter. Co-transfection
with GATA-1 expression vector for the reporter assay indic-
ated that either mutation of GATA site at the G1 or two AATC
sites reduced the GATA-1-activating effect significantly
(Figure 4). Thus, both GATA and AATC sites are recognized
by GATA-1 for transcriptional activation.
Gfi-1B inhibits GATA-1-mediated transcription
Given that GATA-1 is essential for activating the Gfi-1B pro-
moter, we then raised the question whether GATA-1-mediated
transcription is inhibited by co-expression of Gfi-1B protein.
To address this question, we transfected 293T cells with

normalization by b-galactosidase were calculated relative to that in the
cells transfected with wild type of pGL2-hG (325/+19) and control vector,
which was set arbitrarily to 1. The data are means ± SD (n ¼ 3) from three
independent experiments.

3XGATA-reporter plasmid and the control plasmid pT81-Luc
with expression vector of GATA-1 in the presence or absence
of Gfi-1B-FLAG co-expression (Figure 5A). It turned out that
co-expression of Gfi-1B specifically repressed GATA-1-
dependent activation of luciferase activity derived from
3XGATA-reporter. Similar results were also seen in the
cells that were transfected with Gfi-1B promoter luciferase
construct (Figure 5B). Clearly, Gfi-1B negatively auto-
regulates its own promoter through repressing GATA-1-
mediated transcription. Since Gfi-1B is unable to bind to
GATA sequence, these data also suggest that Gfi-1B-
mediated repression need not work through its binding to
the recognition sequence.
Gfi-1B interacts with GATA-1
To assess the mechanism responsible for the repression of
GATA-1-mediated transcription by Gfi-1B, we then tested
whether Gfi-1B interacts with GATA-1 by transfecting
293T cells with expression vectors of Gfi-1B-FLAG and
Myc-GATA-1 for the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As
shown in Figure 6A, Myc-GATA-1 was co-immunopre-
cipiated with Gfi-1B-FLAG by anti-FLAG M2 antibody in
the cell lysate co-expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG and Myc-
GATA-1, while no myc-GATA-1 was precipitated in the
cell lysate expressing Myc-GATA-1 alone. This result sug-
gests that co-expression of both proteins can form a specific
complex in the cells. We then further defined the domain
necessary for their interaction. GATA-1 contains two zinc
fingers. One is the carboxyl finger spanning 257–287 amino
acids which is essential for DNA binding and the other
N-terminal finger at 199–255 amino acids which stabilizes
its binding to the GATA sequence (23–25). We then construc-
ted different deleted forms of pMyc-GATA-1 for the co-
immunoprecipitation experiment. After co-expression with
Gfi-1B-FLAG in 293T cells, we found that both the wild-
type and 1–287, but not 1–199 or 1–255, forms of Myc-
GATA-1, formed a complex with Gfi-1B-FLAG (Figure 6B),
indicating that carboxyl finger of GATA-1 is necessary for its
interaction with Gfi-1B protein.
Gfi-1B contains a SNAG domain in the N-terminus medi-
ating its transcriptional repression and six zinc-finger domains
at its C-terminus for DNA binding (1–3). To examine
the domain of Gfi-1B that is involved in complex formation
with GATA-1 protein, we expressed various deleted forms
of FLAG-Gfi-1B with Myc-GATA-1 in 293T cells for
co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in Figure 6C,
deletion of carboxyl zinc-finger (C-del) abrogated the inter-
action of FLAG-Gfi-1B with myc-GATA-1, indicating the
requirement of the carboxyl zinc-finger of Gfi-1B for its
interaction with GATA-1.
The SNAG domain of Gfi-1B is required for inhibiting
GATA-1-mediated trans-activation
To know whether overexpression of Gfi-1B affects the DNA-
binding activity of GATA-1, we performed the gel-shift assay
using consensus GATA binding oligonucleotides as the probe

K562 cells, and luciferase activities were determined. The luciferase activities
were standardized relative to b-galactosidase expression and expressed relative
to wild type of pGL2-hG (325/+19) that was set arbitrarily to 1. The data are
means ± SD from three independent experiments.

with the 293T nuclear extracts expressing GATA-1. Inclusion
of increasing amounts of Gfi-1B-FLAG in nuclear extract did
not perturb the specific GATA-1/DNA complex formation in
the binding reaction (data not shown), indicating that Gfi-1B
does not interfere with DNA-binding activity of GATA-1. We
then turned to determine whether the repression domain of
Gfi-1B is responsible for suppressing GATA-1-mediated
trans-activation. Toward this end, Gfi-1B promoter luciferase
construct was co-transfected with various deleted forms of
FLAG-Gfi-1B constructs and GATA-1 expression vector
into 293T cells. As shown in Figure 7A, removal of SNAG
repression domain relieved the repressive effect of Gfi-1B on
GATA-1-mediated transcription, suggesting the SNAG
domain is required for suppressing GATA-1-mediated tran-
scription of the Gfi-1B promoter. Because the C-del Gfi-1B
loses the ability to interact with GATA-1, as expected, its
expression did not affect GATA-1-mediated trans-activation.
Furthermore, replacement of SNAG domain by a herpes virus
trans-activating protein, VP16, converted Gfi-1B to an activ-
ator for GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation of Gfi-1B
promoter. Thus, the interaction between GATA-1 and Gfi-1B
does not affect the DNA-binding activity of GATA-1, and the
SNAG domain of Gfi-1B contributes to its repression function
on GATA-1-mediated transcription. To ascertain that the func-
tional effect of Gfi-1B on its own promoter is indeed through
GATA-1 binding to the AATC sites, we compared the effect of
VP16-Gfi-1B on GATA-1-mediated activation of wild-type
and AATC-mut Gfi-1B promoter reporter. As shown in
Figure 7B, stimulation of GATA-1-mediated activation of
Gfi-1B promoter by VP16-Gfi-1B was diminished by disrupt-
ing the AATC sites. In summary, Gfi-1B can specifically
interact with GATA-1, by which GATA-1-dependent

GATA-1-dependent binding of Gfi-1B to its own
promoter
Finally, we tested whether GATA-1 is required for Gfi-1B-
FLAG binding to the Gfi-1B promoter in K562 cells. Toward
this end, we depleted the expression of GATA-1 in K562 cells
stably expressing Gfi-1B-FLAG by transfecting these cells
with siRNA of GATA-1 (Figure 8A). We then performed
the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in Gfi-1B-
FLAG expressing cells with FLAG antibody to determine
the effect of GATA-1 depletion on Gfi-1B-FLAG binding to
the Gfi-1B promoter region. As shown in Figure 8B, FLAG
antibody was able to immunoprecipitate formaldehyde-fixed
chromatin containing endogenous Gfi-1B promoter DNA
from cells without GATA-1 depletion. For cells depleted of
GATA-1, FLAG antibody no longer immunoprecipitated
endogenous Gfi-1B promoter DNA, indicating the necessary
role of GATA-1 in mediating Gfi-1B association with its own
promoter in vivo. Our previous study has shown that NF-Y
binds to the Gfi-1B promoter for transcriptional activation.
Here, we showed that GATA-1 depletion did not significantly
alter NF-Y binding with the endogenous Gfi-1B promoter
region, indicating the specific effect of GATA-1 on Gfi-1B-
FLAG binding to the human Gfi-1B promoter. These ChIP
results further supported the role of GATA-1 as a mediator in
Gfi-1B auto-regulation.
DISCUSSION
It is well known that the auto-regulatory loop provides a
mechanism by which the concentration of the transcriptional
regulator is highly controlled. Gfi-1B is a transcriptional
repressor, whose function has been shown to directly repress
transcription of Socs1 and Socs3 in hematopoietic cells (9).
Recent studies using retroviral vector-mediated expression of
Gfi-1B further showed that elevated expression of Gfi-1B
alters behavior of proliferation and differentiation of erythroid

cells at different developmental stage (5,11), suggesting that
its expression level needs to be regulated within the erythroid
differentiation program. In this work, our data suggest that Gfi-
1B is auto-regulated in a negative manner. However, unlike
other auto-regulatory loop, here we show that the expression of
Gfi-1B regulates its own promoter through its interaction with
GATA-1. These results also suggest a new mode of Gfi-1B
action, in which Gfi-1B negatively modulates GATA-1-
mediated transcription through protein interaction without
direct binding to its recognition sequence.
Our previous study has shown that GATA-1 binds to the Gfi-
1B promoter at 132/129 GATA site (17) and plays a neces-
sary role in trans-activating the Gfi-1B promoter in K562 cells.
However, GATA mutation at the 132/129 site did not
abolish GATA-1-mediated activation of the Gfi-1B transcrip-
tion, indicating that additional GATA-1 recognition site is
present in the promoter. Using nuclear extracts from cells
overexpressing GATA-1, our gel-shift data revealed that
GATA-1 also binds to the region containing two tandem
AATC (GATT in the reverse strand) sites at 59/56 and
47/44. Moreover, GATA-1-mediated activation of Gfi-1B
promoter was diminished by mutations introduced to these two
AATC sites, suggesting GATA-1 works on these two non-
typical GATA sites for trans-activation.
The gene targeting experiments have demonstrated that
both GATA-1 and Gfi-1B genes are essential for erythropoiesis
(5,10,11,26–28). The expression patterns of these two genes
have been shown to be well correlated throughout successive
differentiation stages from erythroid-blast-forming units to
mature erythroblasts (5). Data from our studies using the pro-
moter analysis indicate that GATA-1 works on GATA and
AATC sites to activate Gfi-1B transcription, which accounts
for their co-expression pattern. Interestingly, here we show
that the mechanism of GATA-1-mediated transcriptional
activation of Gfi-1B expression is intriguingly restricted by
negative auto-regulation of Gfi-1B through their interaction,
by which GATA-1-mediated transcription is repressed via the
SNAG domain of Gfi-1B. Conceivably, this auto-regulatory
mechanism provides a means to limit the expression level of
Gfi-1B in erythroid cells. Since GATA-1 is a central regulator
in terminal differentiation of erythroid cells (27,29,30), this
auto-regulatory loop is particularly important in controlling
the amount of Gfi-1B expression in a range that would
not perturb the transcription function of GATA-1 during
erythropoiesis.
Up to now, LMO-2 (31,32), FOG-1 (33), Pu.1 (34–36), CBP
(37), Fli-1 (38), Ski (39), EKLF/Sp1 (40) and Herp2 (41) have
been shown to interact with GATA-1. Among them, Pu.1 and
Ski repress GATA-1-mediated trans-activation by inhibiting
its DNA-binding activity through their physical interaction
(36,39). Unlike these two negative regulators but similar to
Herp2 (41), Gfi-1B did not affect DNA-binding activity of
GATA-1. Rather, the inhibitory effect is dependent on its
SNAG repression domain, since replacement of SNAG
domain by VP16 converts Gfi-1B from a co-repressor to a
co-activator in GATA-1-dependent transcription. Our finding
adds Gfi-1B to the list of transcriptional regulators that interact
with GATA-1. It should be mentioned that we did not find the
direct interaction between these two proteins when yeast two-
hybrid system was used for the interaction assay (data not
shown). Therefore, it is possible that Gfi-1B and GATA-1
may require the involvement of other cellular factor or certain
post-translational modification for their complex formation. If
this is true, it would suggest that the inhibitory effect of Gfi-1B
on GATA-1 is modulated in a cell context-dependent manner.
Alternatively, it is also possible that the effect of Gfi-1B on
GATA-1 function depends on other interacting factors and the
gene promoter context as well. More experiments are needed
to define the factors involved in their functional interaction for
further understanding how the interplay between GATA-1 and
Gfi-1B is regulated during terminal maturation and survival of
erythroid cells.
While this manuscript was in its revision preparation,
Rodriguez et al. (19) reported that Gfi-1B is present in the
pull-down complexes containing GATA-1 protein in MEL
cells and that Gfi-1B and GATA-1 are bound to the myc
and myb promoters in vivo. Accordingly, they proposed that
GATA-1 forms a repressive complex with Gfi-1B to repress
expression of myc and myb, thus prohibiting proliferation of
erythroid cells that express elevated level of Gfi-1B. While
their hypothesis remains to be elucidated, data from our ChIP
and reporter analyses demonstrated that Gfi-1B represses and
binds to its own promoter in vivo dependent on the presence of
GATA-1, providing the first direct evidence of Gfi-1B/GATA-
1 repression mechanism. Apparently, the Gfi-1B promoter is
one typical target gene for GATA-1/Gfi-1B complex-mediated
repression in erythroid cells. Taken together, we propose that
the expression of Gfi-1B and the function of GATA-1 in ery-
throid lineage cells are mutually regulated to finely tune their
functions.
Although AATC is the core sequence of a consensus Gfi-1
binding site (1,3), data from different approaches in this study
suggest that Gfi-1B cannot bind to this DNA region of its own
promoter. First, we found that the DNA–protein complexes
formed in the gel-shift assay using 70/41 probe with nuc-
lear extracts of K562 cells could not be competed by Gfi-1
binding consensus oligomer. Although this probe could also
form another prominent complex with K562 extract, we found
that all unrelated oligomers tested in this study competed for
this complex formation, indicating the non-specific nature
of this complex in our gel-shift assay (Figure 3A). Second,
Gfi-1B expressed in 293T cells did not form any specific
complex when Gfi-1B promoter sequence was used as the
probe for the gel-shift assay, while the same extract could
form specific complex with the Gfi-1 consensus oligomer
probe. All our results suggest that these two AATC sites
are preferentially recognized by GATA-1 in K562 cells for
transcriptional activation of Gfi-1B gene.
Contradictory to the results shown here, the report by
Vassen et al. (18) has described that in vitro translated Gfi-
1B formed specific complexes with the mouse Gfi-1B pro-
moter sequence probe covering the two AATC sites in the
gel-shift assays. Their results suggest that Gfi-1B can repress
its own promoter by recognizing these AATC sites directly.
The discrepancy in Gfi-1B binding to these AATC sites in
these two studies could be due to the difference in preparation
of Gfi-1B protein for the gel-shift assays. In the present study,
we used Gfi-1B expressed in nuclear extract for the binding
assay, while in vitro translated Gfi-1B in reticulocyte lysate
was used in their assay condition. Perhaps, co-factor present
in reticulocyte lysate can assist or promote the binding of Gfi-
1B to this sequence. It is worth of noting that in their report,

inclusion of excess amount of unlabeled Gfi-1B promoter
sequence did not abolish the DNA/protein complex formation
between the consensus Gfi-1 oligomer and in vitro translated
Gfi-1B, indicating a higher binding affinity of Gfi-1B to
the consensus Gfi-1 oligomer than to the Gfi-1B promoter
sequence. Their study has shown that enforced expression
of Gfi-1B under the control of the vav promoter in transgenic
mice inhibits endogenous Gfi-1B transcription in spleen but
not in bone marrow, suggesting that negative auto-regulation
of Gfi-1B is highly dependent on the cellular context.
According to our data in K562 cell, the preferential binding
of GATA-1 to the AATC sites and the interaction capability
between GATA-1 and Gfi-1B make a cellular context for the
negative auto-regulation of Gfi-1B through GATA-1. Never-
theless, here we do not exclude the possibility that Gfi-1B
when expressed in abundant amount may still be able to recog-
nize the Gfi-1B promoter through direct binding to the AATC
sites in NIH3T3 cells that are deficient in GATA-1 expression.
Our findings in K562 cells may represent a situation that an
increase of Gfi-1B expression leads to a repression complex
formation through interacting with GATA-1 that has occupied
at the promoter. Thus, GATA-1 acts as an activator or a
repression mediator by sensing the amount of Gfi-1B present
in K562 cells.
