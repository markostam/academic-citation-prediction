[1] Observations of shear waves, alongshore propagating meanders of the mean
alongshore current with periods of a few minutes and alongshore wavelengths of a few
hundred meters, are compared with model predictions based on numerical solutions of the
nonlinear shallow water equations. The model (after O¨zkan-Haller and Kirby (1999))
assumes alongshore homogeneity and temporally steady wave forcing and neglects
wave-current interactions, eddy mixing, and spatial variation of the (nonlinear) bottom
drag coefficient. Although the shapes of observed and modeled shear wave velocity
spectra differ, and root-mean-square velocity fluctuations agree only to within a factor of
about 3, aspects of the cross-shore structure of the observed (0.5–1.0 m above the
seafloor) and modeled (vertically integrated) shear waves are qualitatively similar. Within
the surf zone, where the mean alongshore current (V ) is strong and shear waves are
energetic, observed and modeled shear wave alongshore phase speeds agree and are close
to both V and Clin (the phase speed of linearly unstable modes) consistent with previous
results. Farther offshore, where V is weak and observed and modeled shear wave
energy levels decay rapidly, modeled and observed C diverge from Clin and are close to the
weak alongshore current V. The simulations suggest that the alongshore advection of
eddies shed from the strong, sheared flow closer to shore may contribute to the offshore
decrease in shear wave phase speeds. Similar to the observations, the modeled cross-
and alongshore shear wave velocity fluctuations have approximately equal magnitude, and
the modeled vorticity changes sign across the surf zone.

1. Introduction
[2] Shear waves are several-hundred-meter-long, few-
minute-period instabilities of the breaking-wave-driven
mean alongshore current [Bowen and Holman, 1989;
Oltman-Shay et al., 1989]. Given the cross-shore (x)
profile of the mean alongshore current V(x) and the water
depth, linear stability analysis provides the frequencies,
wave numbers, initial growth rates, and spatial structure of
theoretically unstable modes, but not the modal amplitudes
nor their effect on V(x) [e.g., Dodd et al., 1992]. Simu-
lations based on the nonlinear shallow water equations
(NSWE) provide complete time histories of the instabil-
ities [Allen et al., 1996; Slinn et al., 1998]. For barely
unstable V, the simulations result in weakly nonlinear
shear waves with frequency f, alongshore wave number
k, and spatial structure that closely resemble the theoret-
ically most rapidly growing mode [Feddersen, 1998]. In
this case, finite amplitude effects slightly alter V(x) and
shear wave properties. More nonlinear shear waves form
unsteady, alongshore progressive vortices that occasionally
merge. With strongly nonlinear shear waves, eddies are
ejected from the surf zone, and shear wave mixing substan-
tially alters V(x), eventually limiting the growth of the
instabilities [Allen et al., 1996; Slinn et al., 1998]. Except
for the weakest nonlinearity (when shear wave energy is
highly concentrated at the k-f of the most unstable mode and
its harmonics), the simulated shear wave energy is spread
relatively smoothly over a nondispersive wave number–
frequency band, with roughly the frequency range of linearly
unstable (k, f ).
[3] Simulations from a NSWE model agree qualitatively
with shear wave phase speeds and energy levels observed
with an alongshore array of current meters located about
40 m from the shoreline at Duck, NC [O¨zkan-Haller and
Kirby, 1999]. Shear wave linear stability theory and
numerical models have been reviewed and compared with

field observations at a single cross-shore location [Dodd et
al., 2000].
[4] Case examples of shear waves observed with five
alongshore arrays of current meters spanning the surf zone
are described in section 2. Numerical simulations based
on NSWE (section 3) suggest that shear wave mixing
significantly alters V(x), consistent with previous work.
Near the shoreline, the alongshore phase speeds observed,
numerically simulated, and predicted by linear stability
theory agree within about 30% (section 4). However,
farther offshore where V and shear waves are weaker,
the observed and modeled alongshore phase speeds are
much slower than predicted by linear stability theory,
perhaps owing to advection of eddies shed from the
stronger flow near the shoreline. The results are summa-
rized in section 5.
2. Observations
[5] Colocated pressure gauges and bidirectional current
meters (PUV) were deployed at 11 locations along a cross-
shore transect extending from 1.0 m depth (50 m from
the shoreline) to 5.5 m depth (400 m from the shore-
line). At 5 cross-shore locations, a six-element, 200 m
aperture alongshore PUV array was deployed (Figure 1).
The bathymetry and mean (1 hour averaged) circulation
observed at the instrumented locations usually were along-
shore homogeneous [Feddersen and Guza, 2003], although
alongshore variability of V at the shallowest array is
significant on 1 November and 13 November (Figures 2b
and 2c). Shear waves observed during the 4-month-long
SandyDuck experiment are described by Noyes et al.
[2004].
[6] Observations are compared with numerical model
predictions for four, 3-hour-long case examples with
different alongshore flows (Figure 2), including a relatively
weak (incident wave height Hrms = 0.55 m (Table 1),
maximum Vmax  45 cm/s) shoreline-intensified jet with a
narrow surf zone (28 August), a stronger (Hrms = 1.05 m,
Vmax  100 cm/s) shoreline-intensified jet with a wider
surf zone (1 November), and moderate flows (Vmax 
75 cm/s) that are either broad with a wide surf zone
(Hrms = 1.90 m, 13 November), or more jet-like with a
narrower surf zone (Hrms = 0.68 m, 17 November, similar to
the V(x) examined by O¨zkan-Haller and Kirby [1999]). The
wind stress twind, estimated from measurements 800 m
from the shoreline at the end of the nearby pier, was weak
relative to the forcing by breaking waves.

[7] Shear waves appear in wave number– frequency
spectra (Eu(k, f ) and Ev(k, f), for cross-(u) and alongshore
(v) velocity components) as a ridge of elevated energy
corresponding to approximately nondispersive (i.e., f varies
linearly with k) propagation in the same direction as V [e.g.,
Oltman-Shay et al., 1989] (Figures 3–7). Wave number–
frequency spectra for v are similar to those for u (compare
Figure 6 with 7), and results for u are discussed in detail
below.
3. Model Description and Calibration
[8] Shear waves were modeled using the time-dependent,
vertically integrated, rigid-lid nonlinear shallow water
equations (NSWE), averaged over incident wave time-
scales, with breaking wave forcing and a quadratic bottom
stress (Appendix B). To reduce the number of adjustable
coefficients, and because observed and modeled shear
wave energies are most similar when eddy mixing is
weaker than shear wave mixing [O¨zkan-Haller and Kirby,
1999], lateral mixing from processes other than shear
waves is neglected (e.g., an eddy viscosity term is not
included). The effects of wave-current interactions
[O¨zkan-Haller and Li, 2003], shear dispersion [Svendsen
and Putrevu, 1994], cross-shore variation of the bottom
drag coefficient [Church and Thornton, 1993; Feddersen
et al., 2004], and temporal variation of V and Syx
associated with wave groups [Haller et al., 1999] also
are neglected. The only adjustable parameter in this
relatively simple model is the bottom drag coefficient
cd. Mean momentum fluxes of incident swell and sea
were characterized using radiation stresses estimated with
a separate ‘‘roller’’ model, initialized with observations in
8 m depth (Appendix C). Several cross-shore depth
profiles spanning the alongshore extent of the current
meter arrays were averaged to obtain the cross-shore depth
profiles h(x) (Figure 1) used in the simulations. The
bottom drag coefficient cd (B3) for each run (Table 1)

and without mixing by shear wave fluctuations (Vsw and Vnsw, bold and thin curves, respectively), and
observed and modeled shear wave phase speeds (Cobs
u and Cmod
u, diamonds and squares, respectively)
versus the cross-shore coordinate. On 13 and 17 November, V was directed southward but is plotted here
(and elsewhere) with reversed sign for comparison with the other cases. The phase speed Cu equals the
slope of the energy-weighted, best-fit line to the shear wave ridge in cross-shore velocity spectra Eu(k, f)
(Figures 3–6). Numbers within boxes and vertical shaded lines indicate the positions of operational
alongshore arrays (Figure 1). In some cases an array was operational, but shear wave signal levels were
too low to estimate Cobs
u (e.g., arrays 3, 4, and 5 on 28 August).

was chosen so that the maximum value of the modeled
(with shear wave mixing, Vsw) mean alongshore current
matched the maximum of the observed (Vobs) current.
The cross-shore structure of Vobs(x) usually is reproduced
by the model (compare the thick curves with the filled
circles in Figure 2). The cd values (103) are similar
to those estimated from alongshore momentum balances
using many 24-hour-long observations of mean currents
obtained between August and November [Feddersen
and Guza, 2003]. The difference between V modeled with
(Vsw) and without (Vnsw) shear wave fluctuations is sig-
nificant (compare thick with thin curves in Figure 2),
except on 28 August when V is relatively weak. (The
alongshore current Vnsw is the solution to the temporally
steady model equations that are obtained when shear wave
fluctuations are set equal to zero.) The numerical accuracy
of the model is confirmed by close agreement between
simulations (with linear friction and no roller) and analytic
solutions for finite amplitude, weakly nonlinear shear
waves [Feddersen, 1998]. Results for alongshore domain
lengths Ly of 1000, 1500, and (for one case) 1600 m
differed in detail, but were qualitatively similar (e.g.,
energy was similarly concentrated in k-f space). Results
are shown for Ly = 1000 m.

estimates). The local mean alongshore current V (solid line)

wave phase speed Clin = 78 cm/s. Figure 4. (left) Modeled and (right) observed wave

the modeled or observed E(k, f) at array 3, so Cu is not
estimated. Clin = 34 cm/s.

[9] Modeled instantaneous vorticity fields on 28 August
do not show eddy formation, consistent with weakly non-
linear shear waves [Allen et al., 1996]. Vortices form in the
other 3 case examples (1 November is shown in Figure 8),
indicating that the modeled shear waves are more nonlinear
than on 28 August.
4. Comparison of Observations With Numerical
Simulations
4.1. Alongshore Phase Speeds
[10] Nondispersive shear wave phase speeds Cu and Cv
were estimated from the slope of the energy-weighted best-
fit line to the shear wave ridge in Eu(k, f ) and Ev(k, f ),
respectively (Eu(k, f ) and Cu are shown in Figures 3–6).
Estimates of Cu and Cv often are dominated by the lowest
frequencies, which usually have the highest shear wave
energy. In a few cases a ridge was judged subjectively to
be absent in either the observed or modeled E(k, f ) (e.g.,
Figures 4e and 4f), and the corresponding C value was
discarded. In both the observations [Noyes et al., 2004]
and the simulations (not shown) Cu  Cv.
[11] On 28 August, the case with the weakest V, the
model Cmod
u  27 cm/s at arrays 1 and 2 (the only cross-
shore locations where Cmod could be determined, Figures 4a
Figure 5. (left) Modeled and (right) observed wave
number–frequency spectra of cross-shore velocity Eu(k, f )
at arrays (top to bottom) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for 13 November.
The format is the same as Figure 3. The V and Cu were
directed southward but are plotted as if directed northward
for comparison with other cases. Clin = 82 cm/s.
Figure 6. (left) Modeled and (right) observed wave
number–frequency spectra of cross-shore velocity Eu(k, f )
at arrays (top to bottom) 2, 3, and 4 for 17 November. The
format is the same as Figure 3. The observed V and Cu were
directed southward but are plotted as if directed northward
for comparison with other cases. Clin = 60 cm/s.

and 4c, and filled squares in Figure 2a). The model phase
speed Cmod
u is about 20% less than the phase speed of the
fastest growing linear mode Clin = 34 cm/s. (The phase
speed Clin for a single linearly unstable mode is a function
only of f and k, and thus is constant in the cross shore.) On
28 August, shear wave mixing is weak and Clin of the model
mean alongshore currents with (Vsw) or without (Vnsw) shear
waves are similar.
[12] With larger incident waves and increased radiation
stress Syx (Table 1), V is stronger and broader (Figures 2b–
2d), and shear waves (i.e., ridges of energy in k-f spectra)
can be detected farther offshore in both the observations and
the model simulations. Observed and modeled C and V near
the shoreline (e.g., arrays 1 and 2) usually are within 30%
of the phase speed of the most rapidly growing linear
modes (Figures 3–6), similar to Allen et al. [1996] and
O¨zkan-Haller and Kirby [1999]. In contrast to the cross-
shore constant Clin, Cmod and (especially) Cobs decrease
offshore where V is smaller and shear wave energies are
much reduced (Figures 2b–2d).
[13] Successive contour maps of the modeled spatial
distribution of vorticity (e.g., Figure 8) and time-space
trajectories of vorticity (Figure 9) [after O¨zkan-Haller
and Kirby, 1999] at array 3 on 1 November show the
simultaneous presence of features with different phase
speeds. Vorticity fronts propagate with alongshore phase
speed C  60 cm/s, approximately equal to the modeled
C based on ridges in E(k, f ) spectra (Cmod
u = 52 cm/s in
Figure 3e) whereas eddies shed intermittently from the
vorticity front propagate more slowly. The eddy along-
shore propagation speed (40 cm/s, estimated from the
slope of the light blue ridges in Figure 9) at array 3 is
closer to the modeled local mean V (29 cm/s) than to
the speed of the vorticity front (60 cm/s). Model E(k, f )
are broadened by the eddies. Vorticity fronts that dominate
near the shoreline do not reach as far offshore as array 4,
and time-space trajectories of vorticity more than about
300 m from the shoreline are dominated by eddies (not
shown).
[14] The shear wave phase speeds estimated from obser-
vations (Cobs
u ) and predicted by the nonlinear model (Cmod
u )
agree fairly well for all 4 cases (Figure 10a). In contrast to
the cross-shore constant C = Clin expected for weakly
nonlinear shear waves (e.g., 28 August, no eddy forma-
tion), Cobs
u and Cumod usually decrease from values close
to Clin within the alongshore current jet near the shore-
line to smaller values close to V offshore (Figure 10b).
On 28 August the observed and numerically modeled
shear wave energy levels offshore of array 2 were too
weak to estimate C reliably. In the other three cases,
Cobs
u is close to the local alongshore current Vobs at all
array locations, with similar, but weaker cross-shore
variation of Cmod
u (diamonds and squares respectively
in Figures 2b–2d). Additional simulations of moderately
and strongly nonlinear shear waves (not shown) yield
qualitatively similar cross-shore variations and agreement
with observed phase speeds. The model results, and the
close correspondence between Cobs
u and Vobs for the entire
4-month-long data set (shaded area in Figure 10b, from
Noyes et al. [2004]) suggest that shear wave phase speeds
often were determined by alongshore advection of eddies.
4.2. Magnitude of Velocity Fluctuations
[15] Observed and modeled frequency spectra have
comparable levels and similar cross-shore structure at
the dominant shear wave frequencies. For example, at
0.0022 Hz the observed and modeled spectral levels
usually are within a factor of 2 near the shoreline, with
similarly strong cross-shore decay (Figure 11). An excep-
tion is 13 November (Figure 11c), when the observed
shear wave energy varies little over the cross shore.
Although the numerical simulations deviate significantly
from the most rapidly growing linear mode (the vertical
scale of Figure 11 spans 3 decades), both exhibit strong
cross-shore decay seaward of the surf zone. However, the
model frequency spectra show a much steeper roll off at
high frequencies than is observed (not shown, similar to
O¨zkan-Haller and Kirby [1999]). This discrepancy is
caused at least partially by neglected wave-current inter-
actions [O¨zkan-Haller and Li, 2003].
[16] Root-mean-square (rms) shear wave flow speeds
(husw2 i1/2 and hvsw2 i1/2) are estimated by integrating Eu,v(k, f )
Figure 7. (left) Modeled and (right) observed wave
number–frequency spectra of alongshore-shore velocity
Ev(k, f ) at arrays (top to bottom) 2, 3, and 4 for 17
November. The format is the same as Figure 3, except here
for v rather than u. The observed V and Cv were directed
southward but are plotted as if directed northward for
comparison with other cases. Clin = 60 cm/s.

solid arrows indicate locations of eddies A and B. The dotted arrow labeled F indicates the vorticity
front. All features propagate in the direction of the mean current (left to right), but the eddies propagate
slower than the vorticity front. At array 3 (the cross-shore location of the vorticity time series shown in
Figure 9, indicated here with a horizontal white dotted line) the alongshore separation between F and A
increases from about 200 m at 5.02 h (Figure 8a) to about 300 m at 5.17 h (Figure 8c). The solutions
are alongshore periodic, and thus F has wrapped around in Figure 8d, with F separated about 400 m
from A.

over shear wave frequencies (0.00165–0.02500 Hz) and
wave numbers (see, for data processing details, Noyes et
al. [2004]). Underprediction at high frequencies and over-
prediction at low frequencies partially compensate, and
observed and modeled shear wave rms flow speeds are
within a factor of 2 on 1 November and 17 November
(Figure 12), and within about a factor of 4 on 28 August
and 13 November. In all four case examples the observed
and predicted velocity variance is distributed roughly
equally between the u and v components (husw2 i1/2 
hvsw2 i1/2, Figure 12). This approximate isotropy of the
shear wave velocity field was observed during the entire
4-month-long experiment [Noyes et al., 2004], and in
additional model simulations (not shown).
4.3. Rotary Flows
[17] Rotary spectra of the complex flow vector u + iv give
the energy of clockwise S+( f ) and counterclockwise S( f )
rotating flow components as a function of frequency
[Gonella, 1972]. The bulk (frequency-integrated) rotary
coefficient, defined as
Rb ¼
Z fmax
Sþ fð Þ  S fð Þ½  df
Z fmax
Sþ fð Þ þ S fð Þ½  df
; ð1Þ
equals +1 (1) for counterclockwise (clockwise) rotating
velocity vectors with equal (and out of phase) u and v. If
Rb = 0, there is no preferred sense of rotation. To prevent
possible contamination by gravity motions in the observa-
tions at higher shear wave frequencies, fmax = 0.005 Hz.
For each case example, Rb was computed using the
numerical model and the currents observed along the
central cross-shore transect (Figure 1). The observed and
numerically modeled cross-shore variation of Rb agree
qualitatively at locations where the observations are shear
wave–dominated (compare solid curves with filled
symbols in Figure 13). With the exception of the broad
V on 13 November, the observed and modeled Rb change
sign once across the surf zone. In contrast the linear
stability R, based on the most rapidly growing linear
eigenfunction, have multiple sign changes.
5. Summary
[18] Shear waves, instabilities of the breaking-wave-
driven mean alongshore current (V), observed at 5 cross-Figure 9. Numerically modeled vorticity (color scale is on
the right) on 1 November at array 3 (cross-shore location
x = 260 m) versus time t and alongshore coordinate y.
The t-y trajectories of vorticity fronts are narrow, dark blue
ridges with approximately constant slope corresponding to
alongshore phase speed C  60 cm/s. The front indicated
with dashed arrow F (lower right-hand corner) also is
labeled F in Figure 8. Eddies (solid arrows here and in
Figure 8) propagate more slowly (40 cm/s, indicated by
the slope of the light blue ridges) than the vorticity front.
The formation of eddy B (see Figure 8) is indicated here
by the emergence of light blue ridge B from the front F at
t  5.0 hours, y  500 m. When eddy A drifts onshore of
array 3 (see Figures 8c and 8d), the (light blue) ridge A
terminates (t  5.2 hours, y  550 m).

shore locations between the shoreline and 5 m water depth
were compared with numerical solutions of the nonlinear
shallow water equations with wave forcing and bottom
friction. Mean alongshore currents included a weak and a
strong shoreline-intensified jet, a broad flow, and a strong
mid-surf-zone jet. Wave forcing was estimated with a
model for the shoaling and breaking of a narrowband
wave field over the observed bathymetry, using fixed,
standard values for adjustable model coefficients. The
bottom drag coefficient for the nonlinear bottom stress
in the circulation model, tuned to match the observed
mean alongshore current V, is similar to previously esti-
mated values. Modeled root-mean-square shear wave
fluctuations are within a factor of about 3 of observed
values.
[19] Close to shore, where V is strong and shear waves
are energetic, observed and modeled shear wave along-
shore phase speeds agree well, and are close to both the

shore distance on (a) 28 August, (b) 1 November, (c) 13 November, and (d) 17 November. The linear
mode amplitude is selected to match the numerically simulated value at array 2 (cross-shore coordinate
x = 210 m).

local value of V and the phase speed of linearly unstable
modes (as found by O¨zkan-Haller and Kirby [1999]).
Farther offshore, where V is weak and shear wave energy
levels are much reduced, both the observed and modeled
alongshore phase speeds decrease to roughly the local V. A
cross-shore decrease in the numerically simulated phase
speed is consistent with the alongshore advection of eddies
by the relatively weak and unsheared V offshore. The
modeled cross- and alongshore shear wave velocity fluc-
tuations have approximately equal magnitude, and the
model velocity vectors change direction of rotation across
the surf zone, similar to the observations.
Appendix A: Frequency-Directional Spectra
[20] At each alongshore array, velocity data collected at
2 Hz were processed in 3 hour segments that were
quadratically detrended and divided into 448-s-long,
demeaned, Hanning-windowed ensembles with 50%
overlap. Cross spectra with about 24 degrees of freedom
and 0.0011 Hz frequency resolution were used to estimate
alongshore wave number–frequency spectra [Eu(k, f )
and Ev(k, f )] for cross- and alongshore (u, v) velocity
components using the iterative maximum likelihood
estimator (IMLE [Pawka, 1983]). Model E(k, f ) estimated
using IMLE and a spatial array equivalent to the field
array are similar to E(k, f ) estimated with a spatial FFT
over the 1000-m-long model domain (phase speeds C
from IMLE and FFT differ by less than 20%). Observed
(IMLE) and modeled (FFT) shear wave E(k, f ) are shown
here.
Appendix B: Model Summary
[21] Shear waves were modeled using the time-dependent,
rigid-lid, nonlinear shallow water equations, averaged
over incident wave timescales, and including forcing
and dissipation, given by [Allen et al., 1996; Slinn et
al., 1998]

where cd is a nondimensional drag coefficient, h i indicates
averaging over incident wave timescales, and u and v
contain incident velocity fluctuations given by the wave
transformation model (Appendix C), shear waves, and the
mean flow. The averages are evaluated at each time step
using the formulation of Ebersole and Dalyrmple [1980]
(an accurate approximation of hjujvi in field conditions
[Feddersen et al., 2000]). Biharmonic friction (i.e., nhr4u,
with hyperviscosity n of O(1 m4/s)) is included to suppress
numerical instabilities at high wave numbers, and is
important primarily at the shoreline.
[22] The alongshore boundary conditions are periodic,
and the cross-shore boundary conditions are
hu ¼ uxx ¼ vx ¼ vxxx ¼ 0 at x ¼ 0; Lx; ðB4Þ
where subscripts indicate differentiation with respect to
that variable. The nonlinear shallow water equations (B1)
are initialized with a frictionally balanced alongshore
current (i.e., Fy = ty
b/r  nhr4v), and perturbed with a
small (1 cm/s) amplitude, fastest growing linearly unstable
mode of V(x).
[23] Equations (B2)–(B4) are time stepped using a sec-
ond-order Adams-Bashforth algorithm, and solved on a
spatially uniform (dx = dy = 2.5 m), staggered C grid that
spans cross-shore distance Lx = 600 m and alongshore
distance Ly = 1000 m (4–8 alongshore wavelengths of the
fastest-growing mode of V(x)). The averages (B3) are
evaluated at each time step. The free surface is derived from
a direct Poisson solver. Shear instabilities grew to finite
amplitude and stabilized within 4 hours, and the time series
of the next 4 hours of the model simulations were analyzed.
Appendix C: Wave Transformation Model
[24] A wave transformation model was used to estimate
incident wave forcing dSyx/dx (B4) (see, for details and
references, Ruessink et al. [2001]). Breaking wave energy is
transferred to a roller, delaying the transfer of breaking
incident wave momentum to the mean flow. The radiation
stress is given by
Syx ¼ 1
2
Ew
cg
c
sin 2qþ Er sin 2q; ðC1Þ
where c and cg are the incident wave phase and group
speeds, Ew = (1/8) rgHrms
2 and Er are the incident wave and
roller energy, and Hrms is the root-mean-square wave height.
The incident waves are assumed stationary, and narrow in
frequency and direction q. The (energy-weighted) mean
frequency fm of the frequency spectrum E(f) in 8 m water
depth was used to estimate c and cg. Cross-shore changes in
q are given by Snell’s law, with an offshore incident wave
angle qinc determined from (C1) using the total (frequency-
integrated) Ew and Syx observed in 8 m water depth and Er =
0. Evolution equations for Ew and Er are

and s is the deep water wave steepness. The wave number
km of the incident waves is determined from h and fm using
the linear finite depth dispersion relationship. The wave
height parameters (Hrms and Hm) and the fraction of
breaking waves (Q) are related by
1 Q
 lnQ ¼
H2rms
H2m
; ðC3Þ
where the wave heights H are Rayleigh-distributed up to the
cutoff H = Hm [Battjes and Stive, 1985]. Integration of (C2)
from 8 m water depth shoreward using one-sided finite
differences yields the cross-shore distribution of Ew and Er.
As the roller parameter b decreases, the roller dissipation
rate decreases and the location of maximum dSyx/dx is
displaced farther shoreward. In all runs, b = 0.1, similar to
previously used values [Walstra et al., 1996; Ruessink et al.,
2001]. Agreement between the observed and modeled
(including shear waves) V usually is improved by including
a roller (not shown).
[25] On 1 and 17 November, and other days with strong,
shoreline-intensified jets (not shown) unphysically large,
wave-driven V were predicted within 40 m of the shoreline.
These could be suppressed by using a drag coefficient that
increases in shallow water [Ruessink et al., 2001], or by
altering the nearshore bathymetry. Instead, cubic spline
smoothing was used to produce wave-driven V with shore-
line values similar to model values about 50 m from the
shoreline (Figures 2b and 2c).
