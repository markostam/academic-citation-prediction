ABSTRACT
Our previous study described a real-time PCR method
to quantify microRNA (miRNA) precursors using
SYBR green detection [T. D. Schmittgen, J. Jiang,
Q. Liu and L. Yang (2004) Nucleic Acids Res., 32,
e43]. The present study adapted the assay to a 384-
well format and expanded it to include primers to 222
human miRNA precursors. TaqMan minor groove bin-
der probes were used to discriminate nearly identical
members of the let-7 family of miRNA isoforms. The
miRNA precursor expression was profiled in 32
human cell lines from lung, breast, colorectal, hema-
tologic, prostate, pancreatic, and head and neck can-
cers. Some miRNA precursors were expressed at
similar levels in many of the cell lines, while others
were differentially expressed. Clustering analysis of
the miRNA precursor expression data revealed that
most of the cell lines clustered into their respective
tissues from which each cell line was ostensibly
derived. miRNA precursor expression by PCR paral-
leled the mature miRNA expression by northern blot-
ting for most of the conditions studied. Our study
provides PCR primer sequences to all of the known
human miRNA precursors as of December 2004 and
provides a database of the miRNA precursor expres-
sion in many commonly used human cancer cell lines.
INTRODUCTION
Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, 21 nt non-
coding RNAs whose primary function is believed to be
translational repression of protein coding mRNAs [reviewed
in (1,2)]. The mature miRNA is processed from longer pre-
cursor molecules by the enzymes Drosha (3) and Dicer (2).
While >220 miRNAs have been discovered in humans alone
(4), the miRNA’s targets, expression levels and function in
normal and diseased cells remain largely unknown.
Up until very recently, the most common method of quan-
tifying miRNAs was Northern blotting. Northern blotting has
the advantage of simultaneously detecting the precursor and
mature miRNAs, however, they are insensitive methods with
poor throughput. Over the past year, a number of different
approaches have been described to quantify miRNAs includ-
ing cDNA arrays (5–8), a modified Invader assay (9) and real-
time PCR to measure miRNA precursors (10,11). Each of
these methods has distinct advantages and disadvantages.
Real-time PCR has unparalleled sensitivity and specificity;
however, these assays quantify the miRNA precursor and
not the active, mature miRNA. cDNA arrays have excellent
throughput, however arrays are temperamental. Arrays and the
Invader assay do not amplify the miRNA and thus the sensi-
tivity is often compromised.
Our earlier study reported a real-time PCR method to quant-
ify hairpin-containing miRNA precursors (11). This method
used gene-specific primers and a thermostable RT to convert
the hairpin of the primary precursor and precursor miRNA to
cDNA. The cDNA was subsequently amplified and quantified
using real-time PCR and SYBR green detection. Our prior
study described assays to 23 miRNA precursors and studied
the expression levels in six cancer cell lines (11). The expres-
sion levels of the miRNA precursors (PCR assay) were vali-
dated to the mature miRNA (northern blotting) for three
miRNAs in three cancer cell lines (11). We expand the
assay here to include PCR assays to 222 human miRNA pre-
cursors representing all of the known human miRNAs as of
December 2004 (4).
Of the 222 human miRNA genes discovered thus far, 38 are
grouped into families of nearly identical isoforms (4). The
largest of the human families include let-7 (14 members)
and miR-30 (6 members). miRNA isoforms may be one of
two types. The first type is when the mature miRNAs are of
nearly identical sequences, usually differing by 1–3 nt. These
families are designated with a letter (e.g. let-7b and let-7c)
(Figure 1). The second designation is for miRNA genes that
produce the identical mature miRNA from a slightly different
precursor gene (e.g. let-7a-1 and let-7a-2) (Figure 1). These are
designated with a number implying that both genes, let-7a-1

Each isoform is usually located on different chromosomes.
TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probes were designed
to the loop portion of the miRNA precursor allowing dis-
crimination of individual members of the let-7 miRNA
isoforms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, tissues and tissue culture
The following human tumour cell lines were used: K-562
(chronic myelogenous leukemia); HL-60 (promyeolocytic leu-
kemia); Daudi and Ramos (Burkitt lymphoma); Jurkat (T-cell
leukemia); LNCaP, PC3, PPC-1, DU145 and TSU-PR1 (pros-
tate); SCC17A, SCC17B, SCCD12, SCC10B and SCC5 (head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma); MDA231, T47D,
SKBR3, MDA361 and MCF7 (breast cancer); SW620,
HCT8, HCT116, HT29 and HCT15 (colorectal carcinoma);
Panc1 and Hs 766T (pancreatic); H23, H522, HOP62, A549
and H719 (lung cancer); RH30, RH3, CW9019, SMS-CTR
and RD2 (rhabdomyosarcoma) and SK-Hep1, PLC/PRF5,
SNU387 and SNU449 (liver cancer). Cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) or
were obtained from various laboratories. Cancer cell lines
were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5%
CO2 using RPMI 1640 or other suitable media and 10%
fetal bovine serum. Total RNA from normal human liver
and skeletal muscle tissue was purchased from Ambion (Aus-
tin, TX). Hepatocellular carcinoma tumours were received
from Dr Lewis Roberts, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Col-
lection and distribution of liver tissues were approved by the
appropriate Institutional Review Boards at both institutions.
Cloning
The sequences of six miRNA isoforms (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-
7a-3, let-7f-1, let-7f-2 and let-7d) were amplified from
genomic DNA (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)
using primers listed in Supplementary Table 2. Primers
were designed to span 100–125 bp on each side of the hair-
pin. The amplicons were cloned into plasmids using TOPO TA
cloning (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequences of the let-7
isoforms were verified by DNA sequencing.
Primers and TaqMan MGB probes
Primers were designed to all of the known human miRNAs as
of December 2004 (4). These 222 miRNA genes include 38
families of isoforms. Many of the miRNA isoforms differed by
only 1–3 bp in the primer binding sequence (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure 1). If the difference in sequence
occurred towards the 50 end of the primer, then the same
pair of primers was used to amplify both isoforms. If
the sequence difference occurred towards the 30 end of the
primer or there were multiple differences, then a unique pair
of primers was designed to each isoform. An example for
the miR-30 isoforms is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
For this particular isoform family, four different primer
pairs were used, one for miR-30a/miR-30e, one for miR-
30c-1/miR-30c-2 and one for each of miR-30b and miR-
30d (Supplementary Figure 1). Throughout the study we
refer to the expression of 222 miRNA precursors. In actuality,
primers were designed to and data are presented on 201
miRNA precursors since several isoforms were amplified
by the same pair of primers.
Primers were designed to the primary precursor molecule
for several miRNAs. These are designated by the letter ‘P’ in
Supplementary Table 1. Primers were designed to the primary
precursor if we were unable to successfully design primers
to the hairpin-containing precursor. In addition, some
primers were designed to the primary precursors of miRNA
isoforms. Primers were designed using Primer Express ver-
sion 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the
criteria described previously (11). TaqMan MGB probes
were designed using Primer Express software. Probes were
designed to have a 50 FAM and an MGB at the 30 end. TaqMan
MGB probes were synthesized by Applied Biosystems.
Sequences of the TaqMan MGB probes are listed in Supple-
mentary Table 3. Primers were validated on human genomic
DNA (Roche), mouse genomic DNA, cDNA synthesized
from Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) and no
template control reactions.
RNA extraction, DNA extraction and reverse
transcription
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using gene-specific
primers as described (11). Briefly, total RNA was extracted
from 3 · 106 cells using TRIZOL (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA was extracted
from the liver tumors using TRIZOL, after pulverizing the
tumours in a stainless steel mortar and pestle that was chilled
on dry ice. Total RNA was briefly exposed to RNAase-free
DNAase I and 1 mg was reverse transcribed to cDNA using
gene-specific primers and Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen).
The gene specific primers included a mixture of 10 mM

each of the antisense primers to all of the miRNAs and U6
RNA listed in the Supplementary Table 1. Following an 80C
denaturation step and 60C annealing, the cDNA was reacted
for 45 min at 60C as described (11). Genomic DNA from NIH
3T3 mouse fibroblasts was isolated as described (12).
Real-time PCR
The expression of the miRNA precursors was determined
using real-time quantitative PCR as described (11) with
several modifications. Master mix (3 ml) containing all of
the reaction components except the primers was dispensed
into a 384-well real-time PCR plate (Applied Biosystems)
using a 12-channel repeating pipette (Model EDP3-Plus,
Rainin Instruments, Woburn, MA). The master mix contained
0.5 ml of 10· PCR buffer, 0.7 ml of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.1 ml of
12.5 mM dNTPs, 0.01 ml UNG, 0.025 ml Amplitaq Gold DNA
polymerase, 0.5 ml of dilute cDNA (1:50) and water to 3 ml.
All of the PCR reagents were from the SYBR green core
reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). A 2 mM solution of each
pair of primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 was stored in
12-well PCR strip tubes. Each primer (2 ml) was dispensed into
duplicate wells of the 384-well plate using the 12-channel
repeating pipette. Everything was identical for the TaqMan
assays except the TaqMan core reagent kit (Applied Bio-
systems) and 200 nM of the TaqMan MGB primers were
used. Each miRNA listed in Supplementary Table 1 and U6
RNA was assayed in duplicate in the 384-well reaction plate.
Real-time PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems
7900HT real-time PCR instrument equipped with a 384-
well reaction block. PCR was performed for 15 s at 95C
and 1 min at 60C for 40 cycles followed by the thermal
denaturation protocol. TaqMan and SYBR green assays
may be run simultaneously on the 7900HT real-time instru-
ment. The expression of each miRNA relative to U6 RNA was
determined using the 2DCT method (13). To simplify the
presentation of the data, the relative expression values were
multiplied by 105.
Northern blotting
Northern blotting was performed as described (11,14). DNA
oligonucloetides of the reverse compliment to the mature
miRNA were used as probes. Blots were successfully stripped
and re-probed up to three times.
Data analysis
Hierarchical clustering was performed on PCR data (15). DCT
values were used in the analysis (16). Values for each miRNA
were median-centered before clustering. Additional statistical
analysis was done using TIGR Mutiple Array Viewer software
package (TMeV version 3.0) (17). Data were grouped in seven
groups according to the tissue origin of the cell lines. Gene
expression data were then filtered for significance using
ANOVA multiple groups test (18,19) with P-values obtained
from permutation tests (1000 permutations) using Pearson
Correlation as a distance. This subset of 85 significant
genes (Supplementary Table 6) was used for unsupervised
hierarchical clustering based on Complete Linkage method
with Pearson Correlation as a distance (15). Support trees
(20) for samples were constructed using gene resampling
by Jackknifing (resampling without replacement) with 1000
permutations.
RESULTS
TaqMan assay to discriminate miRNA isoforms
TaqMan MGB probes were designed to anneal to the loop
portion of the miRNA precursors (Figure 1). TaqMan probes
are typically designed with a melting temperature (Tm) that is
10C higher than that of the primers. As shown in Figure 1,
the space in between the primer annealing site is very short
(15–20 bp). The presence of the MGB allows the design of
short TaqMan probes with Tms ranging from 61–68
C
(Supplementary Table 3).
An experiment was performed to determine if it is possible
to distinguish one miRNA sequence among nearly identical
isoforms using TaqMan MGB probes. The sequences of six
miRNA isoforms (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-7a-3, let-7f-1, let-7f-2
and let-7d) were cloned into plasmids using PCR and TOPO
TA cloning. The identity of the sequences was verified by
DNA sequencing. Real-time PCR was attempted on seven
different reactions. Each reaction contained the plasmid for
each miRNA precursor and primers specific to each miRNA
isoform. The TaqMan MGB probe for let-7d was added to
each PCR. Only the reaction containing the let-7d plasmid
gave a detectable signal (Figure 2A). Following the real-
time PCR, a portion of each reaction was resolved on an
agarose gel to verify that amplification had occurred in
each PCR (Figure 2B).
Real-time PCR was attempted on plasmids containing each
of the five miRNA precursors (let-7a-1, let-7a-3, let-7f-1, let-
7f-2 and let-7d) using primers and TaqMan MGB probes spe-
cific to each miRNA. Only those reactions containing primers
and probes to the intended target produced a detectable CT
(Figure 3). These experiments verified that it is possible to use
TaqMan MBG probes to quantify miRNA precursors and that
the detection is highly specific to the intended isoform.
Validation of miRNA precursor primers, SYBR green
Each pair of primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 was
validated on human genomic DNA, cDNA synthesized
from Universal Human Reference RNA, mouse genomic
DNA and no template control reactions. All of the primers
listed in Supplementary Table 1 worked successfully on
human genomic DNA (not shown). Successful amplification
was defined by the presence of a single dissociation peak on
the thermal melting curve. For those reactions that produced
multiple dissociation peaks, a new pair of primers were
designed to the primary precursor miRNA. These primers
are listed with the designation ‘p’, e.g. miR-9-1(p) (Supple-
mentary Table 1). Many of the miRNA genes that required
priming of the primary precursor were miRNA genes with
known isoforms (e.g. miR-9-1, -19b-1 and -106a). About
70% of the human primers successfully amplified mouse
genomic DNA (Supplementary Table 1). The ability of
primers to amplify both human and mouse miRNA genes
is probably owing to the similarity in sequence among
these genes. Human miRNA primers were not tested on
mouse cDNA.

RNA is an acceptable internal control for quantitative PCR in
these cell lines.
The relative expression was determined for each of the 222
miRNA precursors (Supplementary Table 4). The relative
expression for all 222 miRNA precursors was clustered
using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and presented as
a heatmap (Figure 5). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
was performed on the data presented as D CT (16), the raw
data may be found in Supplementary Table 5. The heatmap
and dendrogram demonstrate that most of the cell lines clus-
tered into their respective tissues from which each cell line was
ostensibly derived (Figure 5). Five of five hematopoietic and
head and neck cell lines and two of two pancreatic cell lines
produced unique clusters. Four of five lung and colorectal cell
lines produced unique clusters as well. The breast cancer and
prostate cancer cell lines tended to cluster together with four of
five of the prostate cell lines forming a cluster (along with one
breast cancer cell line) and three of five breast plus one pros-
tate forming another cluster (Figure 5B).
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on a
subset of 85 genes which were differentially expressed
(P ¼ 0.01) among groups of cell lines as determined by
ANOVA multi-group comparison test. The subset of the 85
significant genes are listed in Supplementary Table 5. The
resulting support tree (Supplementary Figure 2) shows high
level of support (80–100%) and somewhat better separation of
cell lines according to their tissue of origin. The hematopoietic
and pancreatic lines group into unique clusters (Supplemen-
tary Figure 2). The remaining five cell lines group more clo-
sely than in the unfiltered analysis (Figure 5); two breast lines
being the only exception (Supplementary Figure 2). However,
each of the cell lines does not group into pure clusters, some
trees of the dendrogram contain more than five cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 2).
There were also individual or small groups of cell lines with
miRNA expression that differed significantly from the rest of
the group. All five head and neck cancer cell lines expressed
miR-205 at levels that were 36-fold higher compared with the
other cell lines (Table 1). Increased miR-205 expression in the
head and neck cell lines was validated by northern blotting
(Figure 6). Other examples include increased let-7c precursor
expression in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (53-fold) and
in the lung cancer cell line H522 (7-fold). miR-7-3 was
increased by 122-fold in the colorectal cancer cell line
SW620. Some miRNAs were significantly decreased com-
pared to the entire group including miR-134 in HL-60 cells.
The expression of miRNAs cloned from pancreas tissue (miR-
375 and miR-376) was expressed at higher levels in the mouse
pancreas and pancreatic islet cells compared with mouse brain,
heart and liver tissue (21). While expression of miR-376 pre-
cursor in the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was among the
highest of the cell lines studied, expression of miR-375 in the
two pancreatic cancer cell lines did not differ from the other
cell lines (Supplementary Table 4).
Validation of miRNA precursor expression data
The PCR assay quantifies the miRNA precursors (primary
precursor and precursor) and not the active, mature
miRNA. In order to validate the miRNA precursor data, north-
ern blotting was performed on total RNA from eight of the cell
lines. RNA from MDA-231, SW-620, TSU, PPC-1, DU-145,
SCC-5, HCT-8 and SCC-17A cells was probed for miR-21,
-205, -100 and U6 RNA. The expression of the miRNA pre-
cursors from the PCR assay paralleled that of the mature
miRNA by northern blotting, although the correlation was
somewhat better for miR-100 and miR-205 compared with
miR-21 (Figure 6).

Expression of tissue-specific miRNA
in cell lines and tissues
Expression of mature miR-1/miR-133, miR-122 and miR-9/
miR-124a are reported to be specific to heart/muscle, liver and
brain tissue, respectively (22). Precursors to miR-1, miR-133,
miR-122a, miR-9 and miR-124a were expressed to some
degree in many of the 32 cell lines studied, although none
of these cell lines are from liver, brain, heart or muscle origin
(Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 4). The expression of these
tissue-specific miRNA precursors varied among the 32 cell
lines; some such as miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-133a were
expressed at medium to high levels while others such as
miR-1, miR-122a and miR-124 were expressed at very low
levels (Supplementary Table 4). Northern blots were
attempted on the panel of cell lines presented in Figure 6 to
both miR-9 and miR-9*. Expression of mature miR-9 or
miR-9* was undetectable in these cell lines (data not
shown). This demonstrates that high levels of miRNA precur-
sors may not be processed to mature miRNA in some cases.
It is also possible that expression of tissue-specific, mature
miRNA is restricted to tissues and not cancer cell lines. To
address this, the expression of mature miR-122a, reported to
be specific to liver tissue (21), was examined in liver cancer
cell lines and in liver tissue from cancer and normal liver. As
predicted, the expression of mature miR-122a was negligible
in four liver cancer cell lines, but was expressed at very high
levels in normal liver tissue (Figure 7A). To determine if the
differential expression was due to reduced miR-122a in liver
cancer, the mature miR-122a expression was determined in
three samples of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue from
patients. Mature miR-122a was expressed at high levels in
the hepatocellular carcinomas as well (Figure 7A). The expres-
sion of two additional ‘specific’ miRNAs miR-1 and miR-133
[specific to heart and skeletal muscle (21)] were also studied.
miR-1 was expressed in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines but
at much lower levels than in muscle tissue, while expression of
miR-133 was restricted to muscle tissue but not the muscle-
derived cell lines (Figure 7B). The data presented in Figure 7
demonstrate that at least for these three miRNAs, high levels
of tissue-specific, mature miRNA expression is restricted to
tissues and not to continuous cell lines derived from the same
tissue type.
DISCUSSION
Reported here is an extension of our prior real-time PCR assay
(11) to include primers to 222 human miRNA precursors. The
miRNA precursor expression was profiled in 32 human cancer
cell lines. This is the only study to our knowledge to profile
miRNA expression in such a large number of cancer cell lines.
We also report a novel method to quantify individual members
of nearly identical miRNA isoforms using TaqMan MGB
probes. The assay was adapted to a 384-well format, allowing
for high-throughput quantification of 196 miRNAs in dupli-
cate per reaction plate.
Since the current number of human miRNAs is relatively
small (222) (the number of human miRNAs has increased to
321 since the initial submission of this manuscript), the PCR
assay provides a high-throughput screen for most of the
miRNA precursors (in duplicate) using a single reaction
plate. Other high-throughput assays, such as cDNA micro
arrays, have been used to profile miRNA expression (5–8).
The advantage of real-time PCR is that it is more quantitative
than cDNA arrays; real-time PCR is able to detect a 2-fold
difference in gene expression. The relative sensitivity between
cDNA micro arrays and real-time PCR is exemplified by the
fact that cDNA micro array expression data is validated by
real-time PCR, not the other way around. If the number of
human miRNAs remain fairly small, then high-throughput,
real-time PCR is a practical means to profile miRNA expres-
sion. If the number of human miRNAs increase to 1000, as
recently predicted by Berezikov et al. (23), it will then be
possible to profile miRNA expression using PCR; however,
it may be less practical than micro arrays.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of unfiltered data
demonstrates that the miRNA expression data produced a
near-perfect clustering of the cell lines into the tissue type
from which each cell line were ostensibly derived
(Figure 5). With the exception of the prostate and breast cancer
cell lines, each cell line produced perfect or near-perfect clus-
tering into the respective tissue type (Figure 5). This is remark-
able in that the analysis was performed on only 201 genes.
Ross et al. (24) profiled the expression of 8000 genes in the
60 cell lines used in the National Cancer Institute screen for
anti-cancer drugs (24). This analysis revealed that each of the
cell types produced near-perfect clustering into tissues from
which each cell line was derived; some cell lines such as
leukemia and colorectal clustered into unique branches
while the other 10 lines were split between different trees
of the dendrogram (24). It is interesting that we obtained
similar clustering results as Ross et al. (24) by profiling
only 201 genes compared with 8000. Explanations include
the use of real-time PCR rather than cDNA microarrays
and that noncoding miRNAs were profiled rather than protein

coding mRNAs. Thus, the idea of a tissue-specific miRNA
expression signature may have merit, even among cultured
cells. In addition to differences in tissue origin, the cell
lines were also from three different cell lineages, epithelial
(prostate, breast, colorectal, lung and pancreas), hematopoietic
and squamous cell (head and neck). Clustering produced com-
plete separation of the squamous cell and hematopoetic cell
lines.

Amplification and quantification of the mature miRNA by
PCR presents a challenge because the mature miRNA is
roughly the size of a standard PCR primer. For this reason,
we developed a real-time PCR assay to amplify and quantify
the miRNA precursors as a way to predict the levels of the
active mature miRNA. Validation of mature miRNA expres-
sion was not attempted for each case here; however, valida-
tions attempted in this study (Figure 6) as well as prior cases by
us (11,25) and others (26) demonstrate that the levels of pre-
cursor miRNA often correlate to the mature miRNA. One case
for which no correlation exists is the brain-specific miR-9/
miR-9*. miR-9 precursors were expressed at very high levels
in many of the cell lines (Supplementary Figure 4), however
we were unable to detect mature miR-9/miR-9* by northern
blotting in eight of these cell lines. It will be interesting to see
if the processing of miRNA precursors by specific tissues
contributes to high levels of certain miRNAs such as miR-9
in brain.
Another issue that has not been thoroughly addressed in the
literature is what constitutes ‘miRNA expression’. The diffi-
culty is that northern blotting is currently the gold standard for
miRNA detection, yet northern blotting is inherently insensi-
tive. Based upon our extensive analysis of miRNA precursor
expression using real-time PCR, we have found that typically
only relative precursor expression values >10 are visible by
northern blotting (loading 20–30 mg total RNA). Approxi-
mately 85% of the miRNA precursors studied here had relative
expression values <10, so conceivably, many of these mature
miRNAs would be undetectable by northern blotting. But does
that mean they are not ‘expressed’? It is also possible that
many of the miRNAs appearing as green with relative expres-
sion values <0.1 (Figure 5) represent background rather than
expressed miRNA.
It should be emphasized that the real-time PCR data pre-
sented here is for the miRNA precursors and not the active,
mature miRNA. The relationship between precursor and
mature miRNA expression has not been thoroughly addressed
in the literature using sensitive, high-throughput assays. Only
until these studies are completed will we have a better under-
standing of how miRNA processing is regulated in cell lines
and in normal and diseased tissues. It is conceivable that the
processing of some miRNAs, such as miR-205 and miR-100,
are not regulated and that primary transcript levels are pro-
cessed to mature miRNA in a stoichiometric manner, while
others such as miR-9/miR-9* are regulated. Thus, the real-
time PCR data presented here should be used as a starting point
for those wishing to explore the function of an miRNA in a
particular cell line and investigators should begin their study
by using northern blotting or perhaps more sensitive assays to
ensure that the expression of the mature miRNA is reflected by
the precursor expression reported here.
