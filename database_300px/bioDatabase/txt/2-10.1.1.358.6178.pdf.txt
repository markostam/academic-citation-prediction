ABSTRACT
The RosettaAntibody server (http://antibody.
graylab.jhu.edu) predicts the structure of an anti-
body variable region given the amino-acid
sequences of the respective light and heavy
chains. In an initial stage, the server identifies and
displays the most sequence homologous template
structures for the light and heavy framework regions
and each of the complementarity determining region
(CDR) loops. Subsequently, the most homologous
templates are assembled into a side-chain opti-
mized crude model, and the server returns a picture
and coordinate file. For users requesting a high-
resolution model, the server executes the full
RosettaAntibody protocol which additionally
models the hyper-variable CDR H3 loop. The high-
resolution protocol also relieves steric clashes by
optimizing the CDR backbone torsion angles and
by simultaneously perturbing the relative orientation
of the light and heavy chains. RosettaAntibody
generates 2000 independent structures, and the
server returns pictures, coordinate files, and
detailed scoring information for the 10 top-scoring
models. The 10 models enable users to use rational
judgment in choosing the best model or to use
the set as an ensemble for further studies such as
docking. The high-resolution models generated by
RosettaAntibody have been used for the successful
prediction of antibody–antigen complex structures.
INTRODUCTION
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are a genre of bio-
pharmaceuticals which has beneﬁtted healthcare in vari-
ous ﬁelds from oncology to immune and inﬂammatory
disorders. Development of successful novel therapeutic
antibodies requires understanding of drug and disease
mechanisms and the ability to stabilize, aﬃnity mature,
and humanize antibodies. Antibody structures can help
overcome these challenges by providing atomic level
insights into structure–function relationships and the anti-
body–antigen interaction [e.g. see refs. (1–4)]. However,
experimental techniques for obtaining antibody struc-
tures, like X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic
resonance, are laborious, time consuming and costly.
Computational antibody structure prediction provides a
fast and inexpensive route to obtain structures, including
those which are not obtainable otherwise.
Two antibody variable region (FV) modeling servers are
available on the Internet: the Web Antibody Modeling
(WAM) (5) and Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure
(PIGS) (6) servers. WAM can require several days to
output one antibody model in response to a submitted
query sequence. No information on templates used for
modeling the antibody is provided. Furthermore, anti-
body structures predicted with WAM have internal
clashes and their inaccuracies can confound computa-
tional docking (2,7). The PIGS server returns an antibody
model in about a minute and displays the antibody crystal
structures that it selects as templates. The PIGS models
are generated by grafting complementarity determining
region (CDR) loops onto selected framework templates,
even for the hyper-variable and non-canonical CDR H3
loop. Accurate CDR H3 predictions would only be
expected when a similar CDR H3 loop is present in
the database, which is unlikely for novel antibody
sequences. The existing servers do not provide high-
resolution reﬁnement of antibody structures and do not
consider thermodynamics during modeling.
RosettaAntibody (7) is a homology modeling program
within the Rosetta suite (8) for predicting high-resolution
antibody FV structures. The prediction includes modeling
CDR H3 loop conformations, and it uses a simple free
energy function to relieve steric clashes by simultaneously
optimizing the CDR loop backbone dihedral angles,

the relative orientation of the light (VL) and heavy (VH)
chains, and the side chain conformations. A crude model
where all the CDRs are grafted from template structures
can be provided in a few minutes, and high-resolution
models can be generated by the full RosettaAntibody pro-
tocol running on a cluster of computers in about a day
(sometimes users may need to wait for other jobs in the
queue). The 10 top-scoring RosettaAntibody models can
be used in docking techniques such as EnsembleDock (9)
that can select binding competent conformers during
docking.
A few limitations of RosettaAntibody have been that
(i) execution of multiple scripts for the identiﬁcation of
templates can be complex, (ii) ﬁnding the template struc-
tures that have been used in modeling can be challenging
given the large number of intermediate ﬁles that are
generated (iii) the Rosetta command-line interface can
be diﬃcult to use and (iv) it requires signiﬁcant computa-
tional time to generate all-atom models, requiring a cluster
of computers. To overcome these limitations and to
make the high-resolution modeling available to a broader
community, we have developed the RosettaAntibody
server (http://antibody.graylab.jhu.edu), where the
interface is simple and modest computing resources are
provided.
PROCESSING METHOD
RosettaAntibody predicts the structure of the FV region in
two stages. The ﬁrst stage identiﬁes the CDR loops and
the framework regions in the input sequences, chooses the
most sequence homologous templates for each respective
segment, grafts the template CDRs onto template frame-
works, and ﬁnally optimizes the side chains of all the resi-
dues in the assembled model. The crude model generated
in the ﬁrst stage is used as an input to the second stage.
The second stage of RosettaAntibody is a multi-start,
multi-scale Monte Carlo-plus-minimization algorithm
that generates two thousand candidate structures. The
second stage of the algorithm is split into a low-resolution
and a high-resolution phase. The low-resolution phase
represents side chains as single pseudo-atoms (10) and
generates candidate CDR H3 loop conformations via
fragment assembly and cyclic coordinate descent (11) in
a Monte Carlo loop. Scoring in the low-resolution phase
favors nonlocal properties of native protein structures
such as hydrophobic burial, compactness, pairing of
b-strands and closure of the chain gap during loop build-
ing (12). The high-resolution phase iteratively performs
the following: (i) optimizes side chains via rotamer pack-
ing and continuous minimization (13), (ii) perturbs CDR
backbone torsion angles and the relative orientation of
the light and heavy chains, and (iii) uses gradient-
based minimization over the CDR torsion angles and
the light chain-heavy chain displacement. The high-
resolution energy function includes van der Waals
energy, orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding (14),
implicit Gaussian solvation (15), side-chain rotamer pro-
pensities (16), and a low-weighted distance-dependent
dielectric electrostatic energy (17). Complete methodolog-
ical details are provided in ref. (7).
INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
Input
Amino-acid sequences of the light and heavy chains of
the FV region are submitted to the server by either pasting
the sequences in the appropriate ﬁeld or by uploading
them as two separate FASTA formatted ﬁles. Since the
RosettaAntibody server models only the FV region of
the antibody, FC and leader sequences should be truncated
from the input sequence prior to submission. To uniquely
identify each job, the user must specify the name of the
antibody and can optionally specify the user’s name and
an email address for notiﬁcation when the modeling task
has ﬁnished.
Output
Figure 1 shows a representative output page from the
RosettaAntibody server. The top of the page summarizes
the details of the respective job, e.g. the name of the anti-
body, the name of the user (if provided), and the date and
time of submission, execution and completion. A chart
shows the boundaries of the CDR loops and the frame-
work regions. Next, a table displays the most sequence-
homologous template [identiﬁed by BLAST (18)] for each
antibody segment (VH and VL frameworks, CDRs L1, L2,
L3, H1, H2 and H3). In a series of selectable panes,
the table also displays the top seven templates for each
antibody segment. A picture of the crude FV model,
formed by joining the top templates, is shown next on
the output page with a link for downloading a ﬁle contain-
ing the coordinates and various energies. Residue number-
ing of all models generated by RosettaAntibody follows
Chothia’s antibody numbering scheme (19).
If requested, the next section of the page will show the
10 top-scoring high-resolution structures in rank order by
energy. Each model output ﬁle includes the scoring data of
individual energy terms (van der Waals, solvation, hydro-
gen bonding energies, etc.) for the whole FV model as well
as residue-by-residue breakdowns. Finally, the web page
shows a picture of a superposition of the 10 top-scoring
structures from the perspective of an antigen, demonstrat-
ing the diﬀerences in the diﬀerent models (ﬁgure inset).
Any diﬃculties in processing the sequence would be
shown in a ‘warnings’ section. Warnings sometimes arise
to indicate poor matching of template structures or
broken predicted CDR H3 loop conformations, resulting
in a lower conﬁdence model. Additional explanations of
the warnings are provided in the website documentation.
The documentation page also explains all output in detail,
including a description of the scoring terms found in the
coordinate ﬁles.
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The RosettaAntibody server has a front-end web process
which interfaces with the computation daemon and

Django (http://www.djangoproject.com), provides results
upon request for users and enters modeling tasks into
a MySQL database once an input ﬁle is submitted.
A back-end daemon pulls tasks from the queue in the
MySQL database, translates the modeling task into Perl
wrapper scripts that detect the diﬀerent segments of the
antibody variable region, runs BLAST to detect templates,
speciﬁes a Rosetta++ command-line, and ﬁnally submits
a job to a Condor (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor) queue.
Condor runs the job on our 188-processor Linux cluster
at Johns Hopkins University, as time is available. The
back-end daemon periodically detects the status of the
job to report, and eventually enters the complete set of
results into the MySQL database.
SERVER PERFORMANCE
Since the RosettaAntibody web server opened in
December of 2007, over 100 individuals have used the
web server for more than 400 modeling jobs. Jobs typically
require about 1700 processor-hours, and results are typi-
cally complete within a day of submission, although the
time will vary with the current cluster load and server
queue. The website is free and open to all users with no
login requirement.
Validation of the RosettaAntibody server algorithm
In a large scale test of RosettaAntibody, the program was
used to recover the native crystal structures of 54 antibo-
dies (7). To simulate blind prediction, when database
information was used in modeling, only nonrelated (less
than 90% sequence identity) antibody structures in the
Protein Data Bank (20) were used. For the best ranked
model of each target, the median root mean square devi-
ation (rmsd) of the antigen binding pocket comprising of
all the CDR residues was 1.5 A˚, and 80% of the targets
had an rmsd lower than 2.0 A˚.
The loop modeling capabilities of RosettaAntibody
were tested by ab initio modeling of the CDR H3 loop.
The CDR H3 loop is composed of residues 95–102 of
the heavy chain [Chothia numbering (19)]. The median
backbone heavy atom global rmsd of the CDR H3 loop
prediction for the best ranked model was 1.6, 1.9, 2.4, 3.1
and 6.0 A˚, respectively, for very short (4–6 residues), short
(7–9 residues), medium (10–11 residues), long (12–14
residues) and very long (17–22 residues) loops.
Finally, a practical measure of the accuracy of the anti-
body structures is their utility for docking to antigens.
While the inclusion of the RosettaAntibody reﬁnement
steps had a small eﬀect on homology modeling rmsds
(other than CDR H3), reﬁnement was critical for achiev-
ing docking accuracy (7). When the set of 10 top-scoring
RosettaAntibody FV homology models was used in local
ensemble docking to antigen, a moderate-to-high accuracy
docking prediction [rated by Critical Assessment of
PRediction of Interactions criteria (21)] was achieved in
7 of 15 targets (7).
In a comparison of WAM and RosettaAntibody (7), for
some antibodies, the CDR H3 predicted by WAM was
closer to the native structure than that of the top-scoring
model produced by RosettaAntibody. However, there
was typically a more accurate structure among the
10 top-scoring RosettaAntibody models. Furthermore,
antibody–antigen docking simulations starting with
RosettaAntibody FV models consistently resulted in
more accurate docking predictions than those obtained
by starting with WAM generated models or unreﬁned
RosettaAntibody models (7).
Potential uses of the RosettaAntibody server
Antibody structures can be used to guide rational eﬀorts
to enhance stability (22,23) or to humanize sequences to
minimize immunological response (24,25). Antibody
structures can also be used for docking to their antigens,
either for epitope mapping (26) or for high-resolution
reﬁnement (27). For example, we docked models of mono-
clonal antibody 14B7 to the anthrax toxin protective anti-
gen (2). The models helped us form hypotheses about
the mechanism of aﬃnity maturation of several variants
of 14B7. Several other instances of docking antibody
homology models are present in the literature (28–30).
Docking calculations can be done on several publicly
available servers (31–38) including the RosettaDock
Server (local docking only for high-resolution reﬁnement,
http://rosettadock.graylab.jhu.edu) (39).
Docking of homology models is necessarily less accu-
rate than docking of crystal structures. Experimental
information can be used to mitigate errors. For example,
we used computational mutagenesis and hotspot analysis
to evaluate models of epidermal growth factor receptor
binding to mAb 806 (1). In recognition of the errors
present in homology models, RosettaAntibody provides
10 alternate low-energy structures. There are several
new docking methods which can use multiple input struc-
tures for one of the docking partners (40–43). Our
EnsembleDock program (9) can improve low-energy
docking solutions, and sometimes the low-energy docking
solution is formed by the component homology structure
that is closest to the crystal structure.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Accurate loop modeling remains one of the central chal-
lenges of antibody modeling. Thus, future improvements
might be made as better and more eﬃcient loop modeling
algorithms [e.g. kinematic loop closure (44) or hierarchical
local optimization (45,46)] become available. Predictions
might also be improved by inclusion of NMR constraints
to bias simulations [e.g. (47)]. Some researchers are pursu-
ing therapeutics based ‘heavy chain only’ (VHH) antibo-
dies discovered in the blood of camelids (48). VHHs are
also easy to clone and express, and their structure might
be amendable to prediction, although tests are required to
assess the use of standard antibody database. Finally, we
are currently developing ﬂexible backbone antibody dock-
ing techniques which exploit the same antibody structural
modeling tools as the server. These induced-ﬁt antibody
docking techniques may additionally help overcome
homology modeling errors as predicted structures are
used for high-resolution applications.
