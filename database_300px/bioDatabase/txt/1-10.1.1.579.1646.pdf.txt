ABSTRACT
Cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are prone
to the devastating consequences of trinucleotide
repeat (TNR) expansion. Some CNS cells, includ-
ing astrocytes, show substantial TNR instability in
affected individuals. Since astrocyte enrichment
occurs in brain regions sensitive to neurodegenera-
tion and somatic TNR instability, immortalized
SVG-A astrocytes were used as an ex vivo model
to mimic TNR mutagenesis. Cultured astrocytes
produced frequent (up to 2%) CAGCTG contrac-
tions in a sequence-specific fashion, and an appar-
ent threshold for instability was observed between
25 and 33 repeats. These results suggest that
cultured astrocytes recapitulate key features of
TNR mutagenesis. Furthermore, contractions were
influenced by DNA replication through the repeat,
suggesting that instability can arise by replication-
based mechanisms in these cells. This is a crucial
mechanistic point, since astrocytes in the CNS
retain proliferative capacity throughout life and
could be vulnerable to replication-mediated TNR
instability. The presence of interruptions led to
smaller but more frequent contractions, compared
to a pure repeat, and the interruptions were some-
times deleted to form a perfect tract. In summary, we
suggest that CAGCTG repeat instability in cultured
astrocytes is dynamic and replication-driven, sug-
gesting that TNR mutagenesis may be influenced by
the proliferative capacity of key CNS cells.
INTRODUCTION
Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion causes at least 15
debilitating and often fatal neurodegenerative and neuro-
muscular diseases such as Huntington’s disease (HD),
myotonic dystrophy (DM1), dentatorubropallidoluysian atro-
phy (DRPLA) and many of the spinocerebellar ataxias
(SCAs) [reviewed in Refs (1–3)]. Each disease has a unique
clinical manifestation, but the underlying genetic mutation is
the same—an expansion in the length of a TNR alters the
function or expression of a nearby gene. The link between
this unique form of mutagenesis and human disease makes
understanding the mechanisms of TNR instability both medi-
cally relevant and scientifically important.
It is clear that new DNA must be synthesized to expand a
TNR, but there are differing models as to the nature of the
synthesis. One school of thought is that non-replicational
mechanisms, such as error-prone DNA repair, are the major
sources of instability in key affected tissues. Evidence from
several model systems supports this contention. For example,
intergenerational instability in male HD transgenic mice was
traced to post-mitotic, haploid germ cells (4). Instability in
cell lines derived from DM1 mice did not correlate with
cell division (5). Moreover, a DM1 mouse line that showed
remarkable somatic instability showed the greatest instability
in organs that were not highly proliferative, namely kidney
and brain (6). In addition, a transcription-based assay for
instability in cultured human cells found that large contrac-
tions were independent of proliferation, occurred equally in
confluent and non-confluent cultures, and were reduced by
knockdowns of repair proteins Msh2, Msh3 and XPA (7).
In addition to post-mitotic mechanisms, a second idea is
that TNR mutations can arise as a result of aberrant DNA rep-
lication in proliferating cells. Evidence to support replication-
mediated instability again stems from several sources.
Analysis of CAG repeat mutations in sperm tissue from HD
men showed instability in proliferating pre-meiotic cells, and
instability continued through meiosis into post-meiotic cells
(8). Other studies have shown that TNR mutability can be
modulated up to 10-fold by altering the direction of DNA
replication through a repeat allele in human cells (9), human
cell extracts (10) and nonhuman primate cells (9,11). Also, a
repeat tract’s proximity to the origin of replication appears to
influence the bias for expansions or contractions in nonhuman
primate cells (11) and replication inhibitors can modulate
instability in primary human DM1 fibroblasts (12). When
this evidence is placed in context with many microbial stud-
ies that invoke DNA replication as a major source of TNR
expansions and contractions (13–16), these findings indicate

that TNR instability likely has more than one mechanistic
source and that repair, transcription and replication need
to be evaluated for their contribution to TNR mutagenesis.
Since the brain is a target organ in many of the TNR
diseases, an important consideration is that terminally differ-
entiated neurons are outnumbered by other critical cell popu-
lations such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia
that retain proliferative capacity throughout life. This consid-
eration is important when interpreting studies in humans
and transgenic mice showing age-dependent increases in
TNR length in the central nervous system (CNS) [reviewed
in Ref. (3)]. A main conclusion in some of these studies
(6,17–19) is that non-replicational repair must be the key
mechanism for triggering TNR expansion because neurons
are non-dividing and thus do not replicate their DNA. A con-
cern with this interpretation is that the affected brain regions
include neurons and non-neuronal cells. Since these PCR
analyses included DNA from cells such as glia that retain pro-
liferative capacity, one cannot rule out replication as a source
of the expansions. In fact, several labs have proposed that
replication-derived TNR mutations in glial cells account for
a large portion of the somatic mutations seen in autopsy
tissue from TNR diseased patients (20–22). Moreover, a
laser-capture microdissection study showed that cortical
and cerebellar glial cells from DRPLA patients exhibit
greater somatic TNR instability than surrounding neurons
(23). This is especially significant because the cerebellum
very rarely exhibits somatic TNR instability (18), implying
that the cerebellum’s rare TNR mutations are enriched in
cells capable of proliferation. Taken together with recent evi-
dence that glia help protect neurons from the degenerative
effects of expansions in animal models and that glia them-
selves are sensitive to the toxic effects of TNR expansion
(24,25), a clearer picture of the factors that promote or pre-
vent somatic TNR instability in astrocytes and other glial
cells is needed.
To better understand TNR instability in key CNS cells such
as astrocytes, we took advantage of an immortalized human
astrocytic cell line, SVG-A, and a previously described
shuttle vector assay for CAGCTG repeat contractions (9).
The results from this model system indicate several striking
similarities with human TNR genetics and provide new
mechanistic insights into the fascinating but complex prob-
lem of triplet repeat mutagenesis. We investigated TNR
contractions for several reasons. First, contractions usually
outnumber expansions at allele lengths below the threshold
for the CAGCTG repeats at the HD locus (26), the androgen
receptor gene and the DM1 locus (27), and the MJD1 gene
(28). This observation also holds for subthreshold CGGCCG
repeats at the fragile X locus (29,30), suggesting that contrac-
tions help avoid attainment of the threshold. Second, a recent
study found that HD transgenic animals produce somatic
TNR deletions during development, dependent on cell pro-
liferation, leading the authors to suggest that contractions
may precede expansions in some circumstances (31). Third,
several lines of evidence also suggest that at least some cel-
lular factors are different in expansions versus contractions
(31,32). If so, the contraction process might be exploited
as a means to selectively shorten TNR alleles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
SVG-A cells, an astrocytic subclone of the astroglial SVG
cell line (33,34), were obtained as a generous gift from
Dr Ashok Chauhaun, Johns Hopkins University. These cells
are immortalized with SV40 and express replication-
competent SV40 Large T Antigen. Cells were grown adher-
ently in DMEM (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin and
2.5 mg/ml Amphoterecin B (all from Invitrogen Corporation).
Plasmids and cloning
All shuttle vectors (Figure 1A and B) were produced as
described previously (9). Briefly, these plasmids are deriva-
tives of pRS313 (35). The presence of the SV40 viral origin
of replication (ori) enables plasmid replication in SVG-A
cells. Yeast markers include a selectable promoter-TNR-
URA3 reporter construct for identification of TNR contrac-
tions (9). The ARS/CEN sequence enables low-copy plasmid
replication and segregation in yeast while the HIS3 gene
allows selection for plasmid molecules independent of TNR
length.
Two different shuttle vector backbones were used in this
study. The first backbone, pBL67 (Figure 1A), contains the
SV40 origin of replication and large T antigen gene cloned
into the BamHI site of pRS313. The promoter-TNR-URA3
cassettes were transferred into the vector backbone in two
steps. First, complementary oligonucleotides containing
TNRs and SphI sticky ends were annealed and cloned into
the SphI site of pBL94 (16,36). This produced promoter-
TNR-URA3 constructs which were then digested with
EcoRI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and transferred
en bloc to the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pBL67 (9). The second
vector used here is pBL245 (Figure 1B). This backbone con-
tains only the SV40 origin of replication (and not the large
T antigen gene), cloned in the ApaI site of pRS313 to create
pBL185 (9). SVG-A cells constitutively express SV40
large T antigen, allowing the elimination of large T sequences
from the pBL67 vector. Another advantage of this approach
was that it eliminated an SphI site from the vector backbone
that was present in the large T antigen gene, making unique
the SphI site in the promoter-URA3 cassette. The empty
promoter-SphI-URA3 cassette, containing no TNRs, was
transferred into pBL185 after digestion with the EcoRI and
BamHI, producing pBL245. SphI digestion (New England
Biolabs, Inc.) of pBL245 enabled annealed TNR oligonucleo-
tides containing SphI sticky ends to be cloned into the shuttle
vector backbone directly. Since cloning the SV40 origin of
replication into the ApaI site of pRS313 resulted in its place-
ment on the opposite side of the repeat tract versus pBL67, a
standard system of nomenclature was adopted to ensure con-
sistency between experiments. In all experiments, the named
repeat, such as (CAG)33, refers to a plasmid molecule where
CAG repeats comprise the template for lagging strand synthe-
sis. As a further precaution, comparisons between repeats
of different sequence, length or orientation were only made
between plasmids derived from the same vector backbone.

Shuttle vector assay
The shuttle vector assay (Figure 1C) was slightly modified
from the previous study (9). Briefly, the day before transfec-
tion 2.5 · 105 SVG-A cells were seeded in triplicate in
60 mm tissue culture dishes. The next day, cells were trans-
fected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen Corporation),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol using 5 mg of
shuttle vector DNA and 20 ml of Lipofectamine per dish.
After transfection, cells were incubated for 72 h to enable
plasmid replication. The cells were lysed and plasmid DNA
was extracted using Hirt’s technique (37). Lysates were con-
centrated by centrifugation through a Centricon 50 kDa
MWCO filter (Millipore Corporation). Plasmid DNA was
precipitated with ethanol and digested with DpnI
(New England Biolabs, Inc.) DpnI digestion eliminates any
plasmid molecules that did not replicate in human cells.
DpnI-resistant DNA was then transformed into yeast strain
S1502B (MATa leu2-3, leu2-112 his3-D trp1-289 ura3-52)
using the lithium acetate method (38). A fraction of each
transformation mixture (typically 0.5%) was plated onto
SC-His plates (synthetic complete, lacking histidine), and
the remainder onto SC-His-Ura (synthetic complete, lacking
histidine and uracil) to score for contractions. Colonies on
each plate were counted after 3 days of growth at 30C.
The frequency of contraction was determined as the number
of colonies obtained on SC-His-Ura divided by the total num-
ber of transformants on SC-His, with appropriate correction
for dilution factors. Statistical analyses were performed by
applying a two-tailed Student’s t-test with equal variance to
the relevant datasets. Comparisons between datasets observed
in SVG-A cells were made with no correction for back-
ground. Full details of the assay results are given in Table 1.
A critical control for this assay involves determination of
the background contraction frequency, defined as the percent-
age of contracted TNR tracts in the plasmid population that
did not occur in human cells. The background was deter-
mined by transforming stock plasmid directly into yeast,
bypassing replication in SVG-A cells (Figure 1C). The back-
ground provides quantitation of any TNR contractions
that occurred in Escherichia coli during preparation stock
Figure 1. Shuttle vector plasmids and assay outline. Details are provided in Materials and Methods. (A) The shuttle vector pBL67 contains several important
genetic elements enabling analysis of TNR instability in cultured cells. Genetic elements tinted gray, such as the SV40 origin of replication, drive plasmid
replication in SVG-A cells. A striped-pattern indicates yeast genetic elements for determination of contraction frequency by selection in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Dashed bars indicate Escherichia coli elements that enable replication and large-scale preparation of plasmid by plasmid maxi-kit (Qiagen Inc).
(B) The vector pBL245 follows the same pattern scheme, the only difference between the two vectors being the absence of the large T antigen and the relocation
of the SV40 ori to the opposite side of the repeat tract. (C) Each TNR-containing vector was transfected into SVG-A cells, the cells were cultured for 2–3 days,
then the plasmid DNA was isolated and transformed into yeast for analysis. Contraction frequency was calculated by dividing the number of yeast colonies with a
contraction by the total number of transformants. Background contraction frequencies were measured as described in Materials and Methods. (D) The selection
for contractions in yeast is based on spacing sensitivity of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe adh1 promoter to the distance between the TATA box and the
preferred transcription initiation site, labeled ‘I’. Starting TNR lengths of 33 inhibit expression of the URA3 reporter gene and yield a Ura phenotype (36). TNR
contractions that remove at least five repeats restore promoter activity and result in a Ura+ phenotype.

plasmid, or in yeast before selection became effective.
Background frequencies were calculated from at least three
independent measurements.
Identification of TNR contractions
Yeast was used as a biosensor (9) for contractions arising in
SVG-A cells (Figure 1D). Briefly, gene expression driven by
the Schizosaccharomyces pombe adh1 promoter is dependent
on the proper spacing between the TATA box and the down-
stream transcription initiation site (labeled ‘I’ in the figure).
When a TNR-containing 33 triplet repeats is inserted between
the TATA box and ‘I’, yeast transcription initiates upstream
of ‘I’ and this causes an out-of-frame ATG codon to be
encoded and a nonsense URA3 gene product to be produced.
However, if a contraction to a TNR length <28 repeats
occurs in human cells, upon transfer to yeast transcription
will initiate at ‘I’, translation begins at the URA3 ATG codon,
and the cells become phenotypically Ura+. Thus Ura+ yeast
colonies reflect contraction events that occurred in SVG-A
cells. Note that in some plasmids, the initial TNR tract was
<33 repeats. In these instances, genetically inert, randomized
sequences were appended to make the total DNA length
99 nt. For example, 25 CAG repeats +24 nt of randomized
sequences are referred to as (CAG)25+8.
PCR analysis
To authenticate contractions and to determine their size, indi-
vidual Ura+ yeast colonies were resuspended in water and
heated to 95C for 10 min. Subsequent PCR amplification
used a-32P-dCTP or Cy5-labeled primers flanking the repeat
tract for 30 cycles (1 min at 94C, 1 min at 60C and 1 min at
72C), plus a final extension at 72C for 5 min. The products
were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. PCR
product sizes (±2 repeat units) were determined by com-
parison with a standard containing repeats of known size.
Restriction analysis of contractions of interrupted
TNR alleles
Interrupted TNR alleles were created by introducing tandem
ATG interruptions in a CTG repeat tract, resulting in a TNR
tract with the sequence (CTG)6(ATG)2(CTG)25. The presence
of either one or two ATG interruptions in a CTG repeat
sequence introduces a recognition site for the restriction
enzyme SfaNI (New England Biolabs). After passage through
SVG-A cells and transformation into yeast, PCR products
from contracted interrupted and perfect TNR alleles were iso-
lated by the QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc.)
and digested with SfaNI. The presence or absence of the
interruptions (as determined by SfaNI sensitivity) was visual-
ized after separation on a 6% sequencing gel.
Immunofluorescent detection of GFAP
The day before staining, 105 SVG-A cells were seeded in
each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. Cells were washed
with PBS and fixed in ice-cold acetone/methanol. After fixa-
tion, cells were permeabilized and blocked with Triton-X
100/BSA for 20 min. Half of the wells were treated over-
night with a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-human GFAP

RESULTS
In previous work (9), we developed a shuttle vector assay
that quantitatively measures CAGCTG repeat contractions
(Figure 1). The assay allows facile analysis of contraction fre-
quency as a function of key cis-elements known from human
TNR genetics, such as the repeat length, the direction of
DNA replication, the structure-forming capacity and the
purity of the repeat. This assay utilizes shuttle vector plas-
mids (Figure 1A and B) that are passaged through SVG-A
astrocytes and transferred into yeast, where genetic selection
reveals the frequency of TNR contractions occurring during
replication in cell culture. An outline of the assay is shown
in Figure 1C and the mechanism of the yeast selection
process is shown in Figure 1D. Yeast colonies, harboring a
contracted TNR-containing shuttle vector plasmid, are lysed
and the repeat tract is amplified with primers flanking the
repeat to measure contraction size (Materials and Methods).
The shuttle vector assay enables quantitative measurement
of contraction frequencies (9), and is, to our knowledge, the
only cell culture assay with suitable sensitivity to readily
monitor TNR instability for alleles near the crucial threshold
length of 30–40 repeats.
Replication and CAGCTG repeat contractions occur
readily in SVG-A cells
To confirm the CNS nature of the SVG-A cells under study,
cells were stained for expression of glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein (GFAP), an intermediate filament restricted to glial cells
like astrocytes. Figure 2A shows that SVG-A cells express
GFAP. More than 1000 cells were examined by fluorescence
microscopy and 100% stained positively for GFAP. Control
experiments (data not shown) proved that positive staining
required the anti-GFAP primary antibody. Additionally, the
GFAP stain in Figure 2A demonstrates a morphology consis-
tent with that observed in another study of cultured astrocytes
maintained in serum-supplemented media (39). Together,
these findings support the astrocytic nature of SVG-A cells
used here.
Since the role of replication in TNR mutagenesis is con-
troversial, it is of particular importance to evaluate replication
in cultured astrocytes. Shuttle vectors (Figure 1A and B) are
predicted to replicate in SVG-A cells due to expression
of large T antigen plus the presence of the SV40 ori.
The SV40 system is a reasonable model because, once the
origin is unwound, viral replication occurs with high fidelity
using the host-cell replication machinery (40), suggesting our
plasmid system will likely mimic replication events on
chromosomal DNA. Furthermore, incubation with nuclear
extracts causes SV40-derived plasmids to fold into chromatin
structures in vitro, and this nucleosome folding is enhanced
after plasmid replication (41). Following transfection and
recovery from SVG-A cells, replication was assessed by
challenging DNA with the dam methylation-sensitive restric-
tion enzyme DpnI. DNA that has replicated at least once in
SVG-A cells will be resistant to digestion. A representative
DpnI analysis is shown in the left panel Figure 2B. Lanes
1–2 show that DpnI digestion proceeds to completion for
stock plasmid prepared in E.coli, as expected. Lane 3 con-
tains uncut DNA recovered from transfected SVG-A cells,
while plasmid preparations from three independent trans-
fections (lanes 4–6) show a bright band of DpnI-resistant

intentionally left empty. The right panel shows the analysis of individual

contractions are shown in lanes 8–13. Fragment sizes, stated as repeat units,
were deduced by comparison with molecular weight standards (data not

plasmid DNA, consistent with substantial levels of DNA rep-
lication. DpnI-digested plasmid preparations were trans-
formed into yeast and putative CAG repeat contractions
were identified as Ura+ yeast colonies (Figure 1C and D).
Contractions were confirmed by PCR amplification of the
CAG repeat locus, as shown in Figure 2B, right panel. The
starting plasmid gave a PCR product consistent with 33
repeats, whereas plasmid DNA from the Ura+ colonies
yielded shorter PCR products corresponding to ultimate
repeat tracts of 11–25 repeats (contractions of 8 to 22).
Together, these results indicate that the glial SVG-A cells
support shuttle vector replication and show instability of
CAGCTG repeat tracts.
Length and orientation dependence of CAGCTG
contractions in SVG-A cells
A signature characteristic of TNR instability in humans is a
sharp increase in mutagenesis as the tract reaches or exceeds
a threshold of 35 repeats. Consistent with the literature, we
define a threshold as a demarcation between genetically sta-
ble and unstable alleles over a narrow range of repeat length.
We sought to evaluate a potential threshold in astrocytic
SVG-A cells. To accomplish this, CAG alleles of 0–33
repeats were created as shown in Figure 3A. Non-repeating
sequence was used to normalize the length of all CAG tracts
to 99 nt. Shuttle vectors harboring these repeat constructs
were passaged through SVG-A cells and subsequent analysis
in yeast produced the plot shown in Figure 3B. The frequency
of CAG contractions was indistinguishable from background
at 0 or 15 repeats (Table 1, entry 9B), but then rose sharply
between 25 and 33 repeats. For the longest reporter, 2% of
all the CAG alleles underwent contraction during a transient
three-day passage in SVG-A cells. Furthermore, lengthening
the CAG tract from 25 to 33 repeats (+32%) resulted in a
1000% increase in contraction frequency, consistent with a
threshold at or near 35 repeats. The observed contraction
frequency at 30 repeats did not achieve statistical significance
over background, but the 25 and 33 repeat results were
clearly distinguishable from background (Table 1, entries
10C, E and F). Thus CAG contraction frequencies suggest
a threshold-like response in SVG-A cells.
Given that the distance of the SV40 origin from the
CAGCTG tract is known to modulate repeat instability in
primate cells (11), the position of the appended random
sequence [e.g. in (CAG)25+8] is a potential complicating fac-
tor. However, the data in Table 1 show that (CAG)25, whether
tested in pBL67 or pBL245, had indistinguishable mutation
frequencies of 0.19 and 0.17%. The results for (CAG)33
were also consistently 10-fold higher in the two plasmids
(1.9% for both). These data indicate that the appended ran-
dom sequence does not affect the results, at least for these
two locations relative to the SV40 origin.
Replication-dependent TNR contractions in microbes
often exhibit an orientation effect, where contractions are
more frequent when CTG occupies the lagging template
strand rather than the complementary sequence CAG. In a
prior study using the shuttle vector assay, the opposite was
true in human 293T and 293 kidney cells; contractions
were 10-fold more frequent when CAG comprised the
lagging strand template (9). This prompted us to examine
orientation effects in SVG-A cells, as depicted schematically
in Figure 4A. The only difference in the two plasmids
(left and middle panels in Figure 4A) is the cloning
orientation of the CAGCTG tract. To add to the findings
in our previous study (9), we examined the orientation
dependence of (CAGCTG)33 alleles, in addition to alleles
containing 25 repeats. The result in Figure 4B indicates that
(CAG)33 sequences contract 7-fold more often than
(CTG)33 and the orientation effect was statistically significant
(P ¼ 0.02). Moreover, we took advantage of another series of
shuttle vectors—with the SV40 ori relocated to the opposite
side of the repeat tract—to test whether switching the
direction of replication through otherwise identical repeats

can influence TNR mutability. The plasmid, called
(CAG)33–new ori harbored repeats in the same sequence con-
text as the (CTG)33 vector, but movement of the replication
origin resulted in fork movement through the repeat in the
opposite direction, such that CAG repeats occupied the lag-
ging template strand. This effect is depicted pictorially in
the middle and right panels of Figure 4A. Reassignment of
CAG repeats to the lagging template resulted in full restora-
tion of instability in the (CAG)33–new ori vector (Figure 4B
and Table 1 entry 9F). This restoration suggests that the ori-
entation of the repeat with respect to replication is the most
important factor, not the distance from the origin nor flanking
DNA sequences. Furthermore, restoration also held true for
(CAG)25+8 versus (CTG)25+8 repeat tracts (Table 1, entries
9C, 9G and 9I). To address explicitly the role of DNA rep-
lication in producing CAGCTG contractions in SVG-A
cells, the SV40 origin of replication was deleted from the
shuttle vector backbone. When a 25-repeat CAGCTG allele
is cloned into this backbone and transfected into SVG-A
cells, the contraction frequency was indistinguishable from
background (Table 1, pBL207, entries 9D and 10D), con-
firming that astrocytes experience replication-mediated TNR
instability in this model system, with similar orientation
effects as kidney-derived cells (9).
The relatively low frequency of (CTG)25+8 and (CTG)33
contractions raised the issue of whether CTG repeats require
longer lengths to be mutable, or whether—for some unknown
reason—they are largely immutable in our system. This ques-
tion was answered by increasing the tract length to (CTG)50.
Figure 4C shows that the contraction frequency for (CTG)50
increased significantly compared to (CTG)25+8 (Table 1,
entries 9H and 9G). The absolute frequency for the
(CTG)50 reporter approaches the level seen for (CAG)25+8,
and is significantly above background (P ¼ 0.002). However,
the observed (CTG)50 contraction frequency likely under-
estimates the true contraction frequency in SVG-A cells
because the 50-repeat allele must delete at least 22 repeats
to register as Ura+ in the yeast selection step of our assay
Figure 4. The repeat orientation relative to the direction of replication influences CAGCTG contractions in SVG-A cells. (A) Complementary CAG and CTG
repeats can differentially affect TNR instability based on the orientation of the repeat relative to the direction of replication. In the left panel, CAG repeats reside
on the lagging strand template. In the middle panel, the reverse orientation places the CTG repeats on the lagging template strand. On the right, switching the
position of the SV40 ori reverses the direction of replication and swaps the assignment of leading and lagging strand. The direction of replication was deduced
from the position of the S40 ori relative to the TNR. (B) Contraction frequency (%) is plotted as given in Table 1 (column 9) for the indicated starting alleles.

(Figure 1D). Therefore our assay does not register contrac-
tions of <22 repeats from the (CTG)50 reporter. By compari-
son, a 25 + 8 allele must lose only five repeats to score as a
contraction in our assay. Nonetheless, we can conclude that
CTG runs are mutable in SVG-A cells in a length-dependent
manner (P ¼ 0.04), but they require a longer tract than CAG
repeats to achieve similar contraction frequencies.
Structure-forming capacity promotes TNR contractions
in SVG-A cells
One of the seminal observations in the field of TNR muta-
genesis was that disease-causing repeat sequences have the
ability to form aberrant DNA secondary structures (42–44).
This observation led to models in which TNR instability,
either expansions or contractions, results from error-prone
replication, recombination or repair of DNA structures that
form at TNR loci. To determine whether structure-forming
capacity influences the propensity for TNR contractions in
SVG-A cells, we created shuttle vectors harboring either a
(CAG)25+8 allele, which is predicted to form a stable hairpin
under physiological conditions, or a (TAG)25+8 allele, which
is not predicted to form stable secondary structure. Even with
allele lengths below the putative threshold, hairpin-forming
capacity stimulated contractions by 3-fold (P ¼ 0.04;
Table 1, entries 9I and 9J). The (CAG)25+8 allele contracted
at a frequency that is statistically significantly above back-
ground (P ¼ 0.006), while the (TAG)25+8 contraction
frequency compared to background is only borderline signifi-
cant (P ¼ 0.05; entries 10I and J in Table 1). Hairpin-forming
capacity also appears to be important for CAGCTG contrac-
tions arising from longer 50-repeat alleles. The (CTG)50
run contracted more frequently than hairpin-incompatible
(CTA)50 alleles (Table 1, entries 9H and 9K, P ¼ 0.002).
From these studies, it appears that TNR sequence compatible
with hairpin formation is critical for promoting maximal TNR
instability in CNS cells.
CTG repeat contractions arise from
an interrupted allele
In humans, interrupted alleles harboring 1–3 bp substitutions
do not expand, whereas perfect alleles do. The inference is
that interruptions inhibit expansions, and that the interrupting
nucleotide(s) must be mutated or deleted to yield a perfect,
expandable repeat. However there is little or no contraction
data available in human cells for interrupted alleles. We
used the shuttle vector assay to investigate the contractibility
of an interrupted allele in cultured human astrocytes.
Shuttle vectors were created with an interrupted repeat,
(CTG)6(ATG)2(CTG)25, and a perfect (CTG)33 repeat as a
control. After passage of interrupted and perfect repeat
harboring shuttle vectors through SVG-A cells, there was a
3-fold increase in contraction frequency for interrupted repeat
alleles compared to perfect repeat controls (Figure 5A).
The contraction frequency for the interrupted allele was sta-
tistically significant (P ¼ 0.0001; entry 10L in Table 1) while
the perfect (CTG)33 contraction frequency was borderline
significant (P ¼ 0.05; entry 10M in Table 1). The difference
in contraction frequency between the interrupted allele
and perfect allele, depicted in Figure 5A, was statistically
significant (P ¼ 0.005). Thus the interruption in this particu-
lar allele resulted in more contractions, not fewer.
Though contractions occurred more frequently with the
interrupted allele, PCR analysis (Figure 5B) revealed that
the median contraction size was smaller for an interrupted
allele (median contraction size 16 repeats) compared to
the perfect repeat control (median contraction size 20
repeats). Consistent with a smaller median contraction size,
the spectrum of contraction mutations for the interrupted
allele is skewed towards smaller contractions, and the two
spectra are statistically different by two-tailed Student’s
t-test (P < 0.0001). Retention or loss of the interruptions
was deduced by treating PCR-amplified repeat tracts from
contracted alleles with the restriction enzyme SfaNI.
Contracted alleles that retain at least one ATG interruption
will be sensitive to SfaNI, but deletions that remove both
interruptions become enzyme-resistant. A representative gel
obtained from this assay is shown in Figure 5C. SfaNI sensi-
tivity was retained in 14 out of 20 contractions tested, sug-
gesting a 70% bias towards retaining the interruption during
contractions of interrupted CTG alleles. To confirm that the
SfaNI cleavage assay was appropriately detecting contrac-
tions, DNA sequences were obtained for six samples, three
each from the SfaNI sensitive and resistant categories. All
three contractions which retained SfaNI sensitivity main-
tained both ATG interruptions, the deletions occurred within
the 25 repeat block, and none of the contractions extended
into flanking sequence. The three SfaNI resistant samples
deleted the interruptions and did not involve flanking DNA.
In conclusion, contractions from (CTG)25(ATG)2(CTG)6
were smaller and more frequent than a perfect repeat control,
and the interruptions were usually retained.
DISCUSSION
The cells of the CNS are among the most prone to the devas-
tating consequences of TNR expansion, and some CNS cells,
including astrocytes, show substantial TNR instability in
affected individuals. Furthermore, astrocytes are enriched in
brain regions that are sensitive to neurodegeneration and
somatic instability in TNR diseases (45,46). Based on this
biological relevance, we used immortalized SVG-A astro-
cytes as an ex vivo model to mimic TNR mutagenesis. The
culture model takes into account the proliferative capacity
of astrocytes, and therefore enables us to address questions
regarding replication-dependent sources of TNR instability
in an important CNS cell type. Our results show that astro-
cytes in culture have substantial levels of CAGCTG repeat
contractions, and the genetic elements controlling this instab-
ility mimic signature features from human genetics. Together
these findings suggest that replication-based models of TNR
contractions are relevant to CNS cells with proliferative
capacity, such as astrocytes, and that the molecular mecha-
nisms of instability are likely retained in these cultured
cells. To our knowledge, this study comprises the first genetic
assay for TNR instability performed in cells derived from
the human CNS. The data also suggest that the mechanistic
features that govern TNR instability are consistent between
CNS cells and other tissue types, such as the kidney (9),
that show somatic instability in DM1.

A genetic hallmark of TNR disease is sequence specificity,
such that sequences capable of aberrant secondary structure
in vitro correlates strongly with instability and disease in
human patients (42). In cultured astrocytes, hairpin-forming
capacity was critical for producing statistically distinguish-
able TNR contractions. Furthermore, the unique sensitivity
and flexibility of the shuttle vector assay enabled us to deter-
mine that this holds true in CNS cells for both short and
disease-causing CAGCTG alleles. Another signature charac-
teristic of TNR instability in humans is the threshold, where
mutagenesis increases strongly over a narrow range of repeat
lengths, typically 30–40 repeats (1). SVG-A cells exhibit a
striking 1000% increase in CAG tract contraction frequency
between 25 and 33 repeats, a length change of only 32%.
CTG sequences also showed a strong increase in contraction
frequencies between 25 and 50 repeats. This is the first gen-
etic evidence that TNR contractions display a threshold-like
behavior in cells derived from the human nervous system.
A similar result was reported earlier for COS-1 cells (9).
Moreover, our observations are consistent with a contraction
threshold in cultured astrocytes that is similar to the clinically
relevant germline expansion threshold of 35 repeats (1).
Perhaps as TNR length approaches the threshold in CNS
cells, contractions can occur to reduce the allele size back
to a more stable length and thereby reduce the risk of disease-
causing expansions. We note that our astrocyte system
models somatic instability moreso than germline events,
and that much less is known about genetic thresholds in
somatic tissues. Nonetheless the contraction frequency
curve (Figure 3B) strongly suggests a threshold-like response.
The requirement for the SV40 origin of replication for
contractions and the orientation effect observed during
replication of the shuttle vector in SVG-A cells suggests
that CAGCTG contractions in this system are replication-
dependent. This is important in light of the fact that astrocytes
and other glia retain proliferative capacity throughout life,
unlike terminally differentiated neurons. Therefore, replica-
tion could be a key source of somatic instability in glial
cells. One indication of the important role of somatic instab-
ility in the disease process is a correlation between the
amount of somatic instability in specific brain regions and
susceptibility to neurodegeneration in HD (46). Since expres-
sion of expanded huntingtin in cultured astrocytes decreased

their protection of co-cultured neurons against excitotoxicity
(25), then replication-mediated somatic instability in glial
cells could hasten neurodegeneration in susceptible brain
regions.
In our astrocyte model, we observed a 10-fold orientation
effect such that TNR contractions were strongly favored
when CAG repeats form the template for lagging strand syn-
thesis. The magnitude of this effect was constant for allele
lengths of both 25 and 33 repeats. Similar findings were
observed in 293T and 293 cells, using the same shuttle vector
assay (9). However these results are somewhat surprising
because contractions in most model systems are favored
when CTG runs populate the template strand (13,15,16,47).
Perhaps differential binding by trans-acting factors might
impart greater contractibility to repeats that are replicated
in the CAG orientation. For example, an unknown protein
might bind preferentially to the CAG hairpin and stabilize
it. Alternatively, RPA or another protein might bind preferen-
tially to single-stranded CTG repeats and reduce their ability
to form a hairpin. Whatever the mechanism, our findings
highlight this unique feature of TNR instability in human
cells that is not observed in yeast or E.coli.
We found that an interrupted CTG repeat allele is approxi-
mately three times more contraction prone than a perfect
repeat control. Although our observations run contrary to
the current belief that interruptions act in a wholesale fashion
to prevent TNR instability, it is important to note that ours is
the first study of the effect of interruptions on TNR contrac-
tions in a human system. In yeast, genetic studies indicated
that interruptions prevent contractions primarily by destabi-
lizing putative hairpin intermediates (48), yet our data implies
a different mechanism. Since the majority (70%) of contrac-
tions from interrupted TNRs retained at least one of the inter-
ruptions, it suggests that the interruptions are excluded from
any mutagenic hairpins, but somehow promote contraction in
the nearby DNA. The 30% of contractions that delete inter-
ruptions also suggest that creation of a shortened but perfect
TNR allele via a contraction also represents a potentially sig-
nificant event. Consistent with this idea, when disease-free
alleles at the SCA1 locus were analyzed, 98% contained
interruptions, but the normal alleles that lacked interruptions
were among the shortest observed (49), perhaps the byprod-
uct of a TNR contraction. If interruptions indeed promote
contraction of TNR alleles, this would further highlight
their critical importance in maintaining short, expansion-
averse TNRs in the human genome.
