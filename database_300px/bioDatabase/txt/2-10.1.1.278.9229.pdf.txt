Abstract
Background: Numerous studies suggest genetic influences on sleepiness and circadian rhythms.
The Sleep Heart Health Study collected questionnaire data on sleep habits and sleepiness from
2848 Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort participants. More than 700 participants were
genotyped using the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip, providing a unique opportunity to assess
genetic linkage and association of these traits.
Methods: Sleepiness (defined as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score), usual bedtime and usual
sleep duration were assessed by self-completion questionnaire. Standardized residual measures
adjusted for age, sex and BMI were analyzed. Multipoint variance components linkage analysis was
performed. Association of SNPs to sleep phenotypes was analyzed with both population-based and
family-based association tests, with analysis limited to 70,987 autosomal SNPs with minor allele
frequency ≥10%, call rate ≥80%, and no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p
≥ 0.001).
Results: Heritability of sleepiness was 0.29, bedtime 0.22, and sleep duration 0.17. Both genotype
and sleep phenotype data were available for 749 subjects. Linkage analysis revealed five linkage
peaks of LOD >2: four to usual bedtime, one to sleep duration. These peaks include several
candidate sleep-related genes, including CSNK2A2, encoding a known component of the circadian
molecular clock, and PROK2, encoding a putative transmitter of the behavioral circadian rhythm
from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Association tests identified an association of usual bedtime with
a non-synonymous coding SNP in NPSR1 that has been shown to encode a gain of function mutation
of the neuropeptide S receptor, whose endogenous ligand is a potent promoter of wakefulness.
Each copy of the minor allele of this SNP was associated with a 15 minute later mean bedtime. The
lowest p value was for association of sleepiness with a SNP located in an intron of PDE4D, which
encodes a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase widely expressed in human brain. Full association
results are posted at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007.
Conclusion: This analysis confirms prior reports of significant heritability of sleepiness, usual
bedtime, and usual sleep duration. Several genetic loci with suggestive linkage to these traits are
identified, including linkage peaks containing circadian clock-related genes. Association tests identify
NPSR1 and PDE4D as possible mediators of bedtime and sleepiness.

BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S9 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S9Background
Daytime sleepiness is a common symptom, experienced
at least 3 days per week by 29% of respondents in a recent
poll of U.S. adults [1]. Sleepiness is a major cause of
motor vehicle and occupational accidents, impaired
social function, and reduced quality of life. Within indi-
viduals, the level of sleepiness is modulated by a combi-
nation of homeostatic (duration of wakefulness) and
circadian (time of day) factors [2]. While behavioral fac-
tors and sleep disorders contribute to daytime sleepiness,
there is great individual variability in the susceptibility to
sleepiness in the context of disorders of sleep fragmenta-
tion [3] or sleep deprivation [4], which appears to be a sta-
ble individual trait. Evidence from several studies
indicates that excessive sleepiness is heritable, with herit-
ability estimates from recent twin studies in the range of
0.38–0.48 [5-7]. Persistent circadian rhythm disorders,
such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, are
relatively uncommon, estimated to affect <1% of the adult
population [8]. However, individual differences in diur-
nal preference (morning types or "larks" versus evening
types or "owls") have important implications for work
scheduling and performance that are highly relevant in an
economy in which almost one-fifth of employees are
engaged in shift work [9]. Both twin and family studies
suggest that diurnal preference is heritable, with heritabil-
ity estimates of 0.23–0.47 for usual bedtime or more for-
mal assessment of diurnal preference [10-12]. Usual sleep
duration is an important determinant of daytime sleepi-
ness; moreover, both short and long sleep duration have
been associated in numerous epidemiologic studies with
hypertension [13], diabetes mellitus [14,15], coronary
heart disease [16] and mortality [17-19], although the
mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly
understood. Significant heritability of usual sleep dura-
tion has been reported, with heritability estimates of
0.40–0.44 [10,20].
While sleepiness, diurnal preference, and sleep duration
have long been recognized as heritable traits, the genetic
basis of this heritability is largely unknown. While it has
been suggested that heritability of sleepiness may reflect
genetic influences on sleep-disordered breathing [5], sleep
drive is itself a highly regulated phenomenon and may be
influenced by variations in the numerous genes involved
in the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and
wakefulness. For example, a polymorphism in the gene
encoding adenosine deaminase is reportedly associated
with an increase in slow-wave sleep, a marker of homeo-
static sleep drive [21]. Similarly, a polymorphism in
HCRTR2, the gene encoding the orexin/hypocretin recep-
tor 2, has been identified in 2 patients with idiopathic
hypersomnolence but in no non-sleepy controls [22]. A
polymorphism in the gene encoding this receptor is
known to cause autosomal dominant canine narcolepsy
[23,24], although the role of polymorphisms in genes of
the orexin/hypocretin system in human narcolepsy or
daytime sleepiness in general remains uncertain. Poly-
morphisms in the human period 2 (PER2) and casein
kinase 1d (CSNK1D) genes, known elements of the circa-
dian molecular clock, are associated with autosomal dom-
inant advanced sleep phase syndrome in isolated families
[25,26]. A polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of
the CLOCK gene has been inconsistently reported in asso-
ciation with evening preference [27-29] and a length pol-
ymorphism in a tandem repeat region of the period 3
protein, containing either 4 or 5 repeats of an 18-amino
acid motif, is reportedly associated with diurnal prefer-
ence [30]. These examples notwithstanding, it appears
that sleepiness and diurnal preference are polygenic traits.
In a genome-wide linkage analysis of C57BL/6J × BALB/cJ
hybrid mice, 14 loci were identified that were significantly
linked to circadian phenotypes; only one of these loci was
near a gene proposed to be part of the core mammalian
circadian clock [31]. We are unaware of any published
genome-wide linkage or association studies of daytime
sleepiness, diurnal preference, or sleep duration in
humans.
The present study takes advantage of sleep phenotype data
collected by the Framingham Heart Study at the Offspring
Cycle 6 Examination. These data include measures of day-
time sleepiness, usual bedtime, usual sleep duration, and
sleep-disordered breathing. The aims of this study were to
replicate, in this unselected family-based sample, prior
reports of heritability of these traits and to conduct
genome-wide linkage and association studies of these
traits. Although sleep phenotype data were collected from
fewer than half of all Offspring participants, heritability of
the sleep-related phenotypes was confirmed in this sam-
ple and preliminary linkage and association studies iden-
tified several loci of interest.
Methods
Subjects of this study are drawn from the 2848 Framing-
ham Offspring Study participants who completed sleep
habits questionnaires between 1995 and 1998 (Offspring
Examination Cycle 6) for the Sleep Heart Health Study, a
longitudinal study of the cardiovascular consequences of
sleep-disordered breathing that has been described else-
where [32]. Of these subjects, 891 members of 371 pedi-
grees had biological relatives with valid sleep phenotype
data and thus contributed to the heritability analyses.
Genome-wide SNP genotyping was performed in the
"Family Plate Set" of 1345 members of the largest nuclear
families participating in the Framingham Original and
Offspring cohorts using an Affymetrix 100K SNP Gene-
Chip, as described in the Framingham Heart Study 100K
Project Overview [33]. A maximum of 738 members ofPage 2 of 8
(page number not for citation purposes)
BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S9 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S9203 families contributed informative data to each of the
genetic association analyses of sleep phenotypes.
Data on daytime sleepiness, usual bedtime, and usual
sleep duration were obtained from a self-completion
questionnaire either handed to the participant at the time
of a regularly scheduled visit to the Framingham Study
clinic or mailed to the participant. Sleepiness was defined
as the score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a widely
used and well validated 8-item questionnaire that asks the
likelihood of falling asleep in a variety of commonly
encountered situations [34,35]. Usual bedtime was
obtained from the single question, "What time to you
usually go to bed on weeknights (or work nights)?" Usual
sleep duration was obtained from the single question,
"How many hours of sleep do you usually get on week-
nights (or work nights)?" with integer response options.
The full Sleep Habits Questionnaire is available from the
Sleep Heart Health Study website [36]. Data on work shift
and retirement status were not available in this cohort;
therefore, in order to exclude subjects in whom night shift
work might lead to spurious estimates of circadian pheno-
type, the 0.5% of subjects reporting a usual bedtime
between 5 AM and 6 PM were excluded from analyses of
usual bedtime and usual sleep duration. Those whose
usual bedtime differed by more than two hours between
weekdays and weekends (1.3%) were excluded from anal-
yses of usual bedtime, as behavioral factors were pre-
sumed to have a major influence on this measure.
Similarly, those whose usual sleep duration differed by
more than two hours between weekdays and weekends
(4.2%) were excluded from analyses of sleepiness and
usual sleep duration. As sleepiness, bedtime, and sleep
duration may be influenced by age, sex and BMI
[5,10,20], adjustment for these variables was made by lin-
ear regression. Standardized residuals of the adjusted
sleep phenotype variables were used in genetic analyses.
As further adjustment of sleepiness for usual sleep dura-
tion or self-reported symptoms of sleep-disordered
breathing (snoring, nocturnal breathing pauses) reduced
sample size but had little impact on the linkage and asso-
ciation results, analyses using these further adjustments
are not presented. Standardized residuals were obtained
using PROC REG in the SAS statistical software package
(SAS version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Heritability, linkage and genetic association analysis was
performed as described in the Framingham Heart Study
100K Project Overview [33]. Briefly, multipoint linkage
analysis was implemented using Merlin identity-by-
descent estimates and variance component linkage in
SOLAR with a subset of 10,588 SNPs supplementing 612
microsatellite markers from a previous genome scan.
Association of SNPs to sleep phenotypes was studied with
both population-based association tests using generalized
estimating equations (GEE) and family-based association
tests (FBAT). All association tests employed an additive
model. Reported association test results are limited to
SNPs located on autosomes and meeting the following
quality control criteria: minor allele frequency of ≥10%;
call rate ≥80%; and no significant deviation from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (p ≥ 0.001). Of the 70,987 SNPs
meeting these criteria, 40,249 were located within 60 kb
of a known or putative gene. Physical locations are based
on National Center for Biotechnology Information build
35.
Of the 2848 Offspring Study participants who completed
the sleep habits questionnaire, 699 also underwent over-
night polysomnography; therefore, polysomnographic
data on sleep-disordered breathing were available in a
small subset of subjects included in the Family Plate Set (n
= 219). There were too few subjects to permit linkage anal-
ysis and, as power was very low for association studies,
these data are not considered in this manuscript but are
posted on the web site. The correlation of sleepiness, bed-
time, and sleep duration with polysomnographically
measured apnea-hypopnea index was weak (correlation
coefficients -0.07 to 0.10).
Results
Sleep characteristics of the 749 subjects included in the
Framingham Study Family Plate Set with available sleep
phenotype data are shown in Table 1. Mean age was 55.8
(SD 9.4) years, mean BMI was 28.2 (SD 5.5) kg/m2, and
51.5% were women. Heritability of sleepiness was 0.29 (p
< 0.001), of usual bedtime 0.22 (p < 0.01), and of usual
sleep duration 0.17 (p = .02). The estimated heritability of
sleepiness was not appreciably reduced by further adjust-
ment for usual sleep duration and the presence of habitual
snoring or witnessed apneas (0.28, p = 0.002). Linkage
analysis to these three phenotypes identified no linkage
peaks with LOD >3. Five linkage peaks with LOD >2 were
identified, four to usual bedtime and one to usual sleep
duration (Table 2c). The region of the strongest of these, a
LOD score of 2.45 for usual bedtime with a linkage peak
at 55.5 Mb on chromosome 16, includes the gene encod-
ing casein kinase 2a2 (CSNK2A2, at 56.7 Mb), a known
element of the Drosophila circadian clock. The linkage
peak to usual sleep duration at 71.3 Mb on chromosome
3 includes the gene encoding prokineticin 2 (PROK2, at
71.9 Mb), which may be an important output molecule
from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Three additional link-
age peaks to usual bedtime had maximum LOD scores of
1.9. One of these, located on chromosome 2, includes the
interleukin-1 cytokine cluster. Another, located on chro-
mosome 4 at 62.5 Mb, includes the CLOCK gene (at 56.0–
56.1 Mb). A smaller linkage peak of LOD 1.5 was noted in
this region (at 57.1 Mb) for sleepiness. Kurtosis was low
for sleepiness and usual bedtime, at 0.2 and 1.1, respec-Page 3 of 8

BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S9 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S9tively, although kurtosis of usual sleep duration was high
at 3.0.
The five autosomal SNPs with the lowest p-value for asso-
ciation for each sleep phenotype by population-based and
family-based association tests, and meeting quality con-
trol standards, are displayed in Tables 2a and 2b. Only
one of these is located in a coding region: rs324981 in
NPSR1, associated with usual bedtime, whose minor
allele (frequency 0.44) is a non-synonymous mutation
encoding an Asn107→Ile107 substitution in an exoloop lin-
ing the putative ligand-binding pocket of the neuropep-
tide S receptor [37]. The effect of this polymorphism is
additive, with adjusted mean bedtime delayed by 14.9
minutes in heterozygotes and 29.5 minutes in homozy-
gotes. Only eight SNPs were associated with any of the
sleep phenotypes with p < 10-5. The SNP with the lowest
p value for association to any of the sleep phenotypes is
for the association of rs1823068 with sleepiness by popu-
lation-based association testing (p = 2.5*10-8). This SNP
is located in an intron of the gene encoding phosphodi-
esterase 4D (PDE4D). Other SNPs associated at p < 10-5
include one located in an intron of the gene encoding eyes
absent 1 (EYA1) and two within an intron of the gene
encoding myosin VIIA and Rab interacting protein
(MYRIP) identified by population-based association tests,
and two in or near the gene encoding opioid binding pro-
tein/cell adhesion molecule (OPCML) by family-based
association tests. One was not located near a known gene.
The results of population-based and family-based associ-
ation tests were modestly correlated. For example, when
SNPs were ranked based on the p value for association
with sleepiness, the Spearman correlation coefficient for
rankings from population-based versus family-based tests
was 0.22. Tables 2a and 2b show p-values for both
approaches, allowing assessment of concordance across
approaches for these SNPs. Only 3 SNPs were associated
with sleepiness at p < 0.001 by both approaches; these
were located in FHIT, VTA1, and LRP1B. Of the 5 SNPs
meeting this criterion for usual bedtime, none was in or
near a known gene, and no SNPs met this criterion for
usual sleep duration. Similarly, little overlap was seen
across the three phenotypes. No SNPs associated with
sleepiness at p < 0.001 were associated with either usual
bedtime or sleep duration at this nominal significance
level for either population-based or family-based tests,
and only 4 SNPs met this criterion for overlap between
usual bedtime and sleep duration; three were located in
known genes RYR2, JAZF1, and NDRG1.
Among potential candidate genes for sleep-related pheno-
types, many were poorly represented on the Affymetrix
100K GeneChip. No SNP meeting quality control stand-
ards was located within PROK2, identified in the linkage
analysis as a possible candidate for usual sleep duration.
Only a single SNP was located in PER2 and none in
CSNK1D or PER3, genes associated with familial
advanced or delayed sleep phase syndromes. In contrast,
10 SNPs meeting quality control standards were typed
within the CLOCK gene and 5 within CSNK2A2, none of
which was significantly associated with any sleep pheno-
type by either the population-based or family-based
approaches (lowest p value 0.12). The full results of the
genetic association studies are available at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information dbGaP website
[38].
Discussion
In this family-based study, we have confirmed significant
heritability of sleepiness, usual bedtime, and usual sleep
duration that had been previously reported primarily
from twin cohorts [5-7,10-12,20]. The heritability esti-
mates in this study are lower than those reported in the lit-
erature from twin studies. This may reflect a greater
contribution of environmental influences on these phe-
notypes in the present study that is detected as correlation
between spouse-pairs. Alternatively, an underestimate of
the shared environmental variance in twin studies may
cause them to overstate the genetic contribution, as the
estimated heritability of usual bedtime in this study is
similar to that for diurnal preference in a previous family-
based study [12]. We are unaware of any prior genome-
wide linkage or association studies of these sleep-related
phenotypes in humans. Because sleep phenotypes were
available from only 56% of subjects included in the Fram-
ingham Family Plate Set, study power was limited and no
linkage peaks reaching conventional levels of genome-

ability of sleepiness, most of the suggestive linkage peaks
observed in this study were linked to usual bedtime and
to a lesser extent to usual sleep duration. Several of these
suggestive linkage peaks contain genes of potential impor-
tance to the circadian molecular clock. Two of these peaks
are of particular interest. The linkage to usual bedtime on
chromosome 16 was the strongest observed in this study
(LOD = 2.45), with a peak close to the gene CSNK2A2. Its
product, a catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2, has been
shown to be an important component of the circadian
molecular clock in Drosophila and other organisms [39].
Phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 promotes nuclear
translocation of the PERIOD gene product, and mutations
that impair catalytic activity or subunit multimerization
cause a lengthening of the circadian period [40,41].
Although casein kinase 2 has not previously been impli-
cated in human circadian rhythm disorders, mutations in
the human genes encoding casein kinase 1d and period 2
are associated with familial advanced sleep phase syn-

BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S9 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S9drome [25,26]. The linkage to usual sleep duration on
chromosome 3 (LOD = 2.17) has a peak close to the gene
PROK2. Its product is the precursor of prokineticin 2,
which is highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
regulated by the circadian molecular clock, and believed
to be an important output molecule from the suprachias-
matic nucleus, coordinating and transmitting the behav-
ioral circadian rhythm to multiple brain regions [42,43].
Although not previously implicated in human disorders,
the total sleep duration of prokineticin null mice is
reduced by 83.5 minutes per 24 hour period compared to
their wild-type littermates [44]. The modest linkage to
both bedtime and sleepiness near the CLOCK gene, a cen-
tral component of the molecular circadian clock, is also
intriguing. PROK2 could not be evaluated in association
tests, as no SNPs were typed within this gene. As none of
the 5 SNPs within CSNK2A2 or the 10 within CLOCK was
significantly associated with usual bedtime, other genes in
these regions or chance may be responsible for these link-
age peaks.
Association tests identified several loci that merit follow-
up in other cohorts. The most interesting of these is an
association of usual bedtime with a non-synonymous
coding SNP in NPSR1, which causes an Asn107→Ile107
substitution in the putative ligand-binding pocket of the
neuropeptide S receptor [37]. This same variant has been
linked to asthma in several Caucasian populations
[45,46] but has not been previously reported in associa-
tion with any sleep or circadian phenotype. In mice, neu-
ropeptide S is localized to a small area adjacent to the
noradrenergic locus ceruleus and its intraventricular
administration is a potent, transient stimulus to wakeful-
ness [47]. The Asn107→Ile107 variant of the neuropeptide S
receptor is a gain of function mutation, increasing sensi-
tivity of the receptor to neuropeptide S [37]. Consistent
with this effect on receptor function, mean bedtime is 15
minutes later for each copy of the gene encoding the
Asn107→Ile107 variant.
Although not located in a coding region, the strong asso-
ciation of sleepiness with a SNP located in an intron of the
gene encoding phosphodiesterase 4D also merits further
study. Phosphodiesterase 4 is a cAMP-specific phosphodi-
esterase that has multiple splice variants, with PDE4D
being widely expressed in human brain [48]. Mutations of
PDE4D have been associated with stroke risk in several
populations, possibly related to the role of PDE4 in mod-
ulating inflammatory processes, although the causal
nature of the association remains controversial [49,50].
While the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors caf-
feine and theophylline have long been recognized to pro-
mote wakefulness, this is likely due to antagonism of
dopamine receptors rather than phosphodiesterase inhi-
bition [51]. However, variation in the effects of PDE4D on
brain intracellular levels of cAMP or extracellular levels of
adenosine might influence sleepiness, and the selective
PDE4 inhibitor rolipram is a weak promoter of wakeful-
ness in rats [52].
This study has a number of limitations. The sleep pheno-
types were assessed by questionnaire only. While the
Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a well-validated measure of
usual sleepiness, the single questions regarding usual bed-
time and sleep duration provide only crude measures of
circadian phenotype. Moreover, as subjects did not have a
clinical sleep evaluation, it was not possible to control for
sleep apnea or other primary sleep disorders. A sleepiness
phenotype further adjusted for self-reported usual sleep
duration and frequent snoring or witnessed apneas was
analyzed, however, and results are included in the web
repository. This gave results very similar to those pre-
sented in this manuscript, although with somewhat lower
power due to an additional 15% missing phenotype data.
The present study has statistical limitations as well. The
relatively small number of subjects included in the analy-
sis limits the power to detect true linkage and association,
while the large number of SNPs tested and apparent infla-
tion of Type I error rates for the population-based associ-
ation tests makes it likely that many of the observed
associations are false positive findings. Kurtosis of the
measure of sleep duration may have inflated the LOD
scores from linkage analysis. Thus, all results of this study
require replication in other populations. These statistical
limitations are discussed in more detail in the Overview
[33].
Notwithstanding these limitations, this study begins to
apply the powerful methodologies of genetic epidemiol-
ogy to the study of common sleep and circadian pheno-
types, and identifies for further study several genes that
have not previously been implicated in human sleep and
circadian disorders. These findings require replication,
which will be pursued in other cohorts and by a planned
expansion of the SNP genotyping using a 500,000 SNP
gene chip in a substantially larger sample of Framingham
Study subjects. Collection of more detailed sleep pheno-
type data from a larger sample of Framingham Study sub-
jects will increase the power to detect novel genes
influencing sleep and circadian phenotypes.
Conclusion
This analysis confirms, in a family-based sample, prior
reports of significant heritability of sleepiness, usual bed-
time, and usual sleep duration. It identifies several genetic
loci with suggestive linkage to these traits, including link-
age peaks containing the circadian clock-related genes
CSNK2A2, PROK2 and CLOCK. Among genes identified
by association tests as possible mediators of sleep and cir-
cadian phenotypes, those most promising based on thePage 6 of 8

activity are NPSR1 and PDE4D, which may influence
usual bedtime and daytime sleepiness, respectively. While
these findings require replication in other samples, they
provide evidence of the possible utility of genetic epide-
miology approaches to understanding population varia-
tion in sleep and circadian phenotypes.
