Abstract
Cancer transcription microarray studies commonly deliver
long lists of ‘‘candidate’’ genes that are putatively associated
with the respective disease. For many of these genes, no
functional information, even less their relevance in patho-
logic conditions, is established as they were identified in
large-scale genomics approaches. Strategies and tools are
thus needed to distinguish genes and proteins with mere
tumor association from those causally related to cancer.
Here, we describe a functional profiling approach, where we
analyzed 103 previously uncharacterized genes in cancer
relevant assays that probed their effects on DNA replication
(cell proliferation). The genes had previously been identified
as differentially expressed in genome-wide microarray
studies of tumors. Using an automated high-throughput
assay with single-cell resolution, we discovered seven
activators and nine repressors of DNA replication. These
were further characterized for effects on extracellular signal-
regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling (G1-S transition) and
anchorage-independent growth (tumorigenicity). One activa-
tor and one inhibitor protein of ERK1/2 activation and three
repressors of anchorage-independent growth were identified.
Data from tumor and functional profiling make these
proteins novel prime candidates for further in-depth study
of their roles in cancer development and progression. We
have established a novel functional profiling strategy that
links genomics to cell biology and showed its potential for
discerning cancer relevant modulators of the cell cycle in the
candidate lists from microarray studies. (Cancer Res 2005;
65(17): 7733-42)
Introduction
Proliferation of mammalian cells requires that DNA replication is
strictly regulated and done with high fidelity. The commitment of
cells to enter the S phase is the primary decision point at which
they control their division. Alterations in expression and activity of
proteins that are involved in this process can cause unrestrained
growth and are prerequisite for the development and progression
of cancer (1). In this line, tumor-associated changes in mRNA
transcription are frequently examined in tumor microarray studies.
Whereas such analyses typically identify hundreds or thousands of
genes (2–4), often, the function of the encoded proteins is unknown
and their role in the disease process is not well understood (5).
Long lists of differentially expressed genes reflect the complex
interplay of biological processes that are involved in cancer (e.g.,
inflammation, angiogenesis, metabolism, as well as cell cycle
control, and apoptosis; refs. 6–9). The distinction between
causative changes in gene expression from secondary effects
remains a key challenge.
We adopted the idea of functional profiling (10), developed a
cancer relevant automated high-throughput assay, and applied it
to genes that were associated with cancer by whole genome
microarray analysis (11, 12). This identified novel proteins that
modified the rate of DNA replication in mammalian cells, this
being the first direct indication of a causative relation to
oncogenic processes. We refined the functional profiles for 16
candidate genes and proteins with assays that probed other cell
cycle– and cancer-related processes, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, and anchorage-independent
growth. Functional profiling distinguished causative from sec-
ondary effects and is therefore able to bridge the gap between
whole genome tumor microarray studies and single candidate
analysis.
Materials and Methods
Selection of novel full-length cDNAs. Tumors of the brain, breast,
kidney, and gastrointestinal stroma were screened for cancer-associated
changes in mRNA transcription using a 31,500-element whole tran-
scriptome cDNA array (11, 12). Genes with differential expression
between normal and tumor samples or between tumor types were
selected by a two-sample t test. From these, we selected 103 open

reading frames (ORF) based on the availability of full-length cDNAs for
the cell-based bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay. The
cDNAs had been isolated from libraries of human fetal brain (library
DKFZp564), human fetal kidney (DKFZp566), human amygdala
(DKFZp761), human uterus (DKFZp586), and human testis (DKFZp434;
ref. 13). ORFs were cloned and sequence validated in Gateway (14)
vectors, then shuttled into NH2-terminal cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)
and COOH-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to produce
mammalian expression constructs under control of the cytomegalovirus
promoter (15). Subcellular localization of proteins was determined as
described (15). Initial annotation of protein sequences was done with
automated tools (16).
Automated cell-based assay to assess DNA replication. Expression
plasmids were isolated in a 96-well format using a MultiProbe IIex-Robot
(Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA) and Montage Plasmid Miniprep96 Kits
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). DNA masterplates were generated with a final
concentration of 27.5 ng/AL and a total volume of 80 AL per well. Cells
(10,000; NIH 3T3 cells: ATCC CRL-1658) were transfected (Effectene, Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) using 100 ng plasmid DNA per well in an array of 12
chamber slides (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) to mimic a 96-well
plate. Each CFP and YFP expression construct was included in duplicate.
Control cDNAs (CFP-cyclin A, cyclin A-YFP as positive controls for
activating, CFP subunit A of phosphatase 2, subunit A of phosphatase 2-
YFP as positive controls for repressing effects on DNA replication; CFP and
YFP served as negative controls) were placed at fixed positions within the
plate. After 24 hours, cells were incubated in presence of 1 mmol/L BrdUrd
for 6 hours before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Transfection, BrdUrd
immunostaining with a mouse anti-BrdUrd primary antibody (Roche
Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany), incubation with a Cy5-labeled goat anti-
mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Karlsruhe, Germany), and
4V,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole (DAPI) staining were done using a Multi-
Probe robot.
Image acquisition and analysis. A fully automated high-content
screening microscope (17) was used to measure on average 19 frames
from each well. The image frames consisted of three color channels (CFP/
YFP, Cy5, and DAPI) each at 1,280  1,024 pixels at 12-bit resolution. Images
were analyzed by an automated segmentation and quantification algorithm
that we implemented in Labview (National Instruments, http://ni.com).
Within-well analysis. The data from one well were modeled as
bi ¼ mðtiÞ þ uf ðiÞ þ jdi þ ei
where bi , ti , and di are the BrdUrd, transfection, and DAPI intensities,
respectively, for cell i; m is a smooth regression function, f(i) is the frame
in which cell i was found; uf is the background for the fth frame; n is a
spectral crosstalk coefficient; and ei is a noise term. We introduced the
correction termsuf andndi to address empiricallyobserved systematic effects:
effects: uf accounts for the different baseline levels of the fluorescence
intensities in different frames and n for spectral overlap from the DAPI
signal into the CFP detection channel. A separate coefficient n was fitted
for each 96-well plate to account for apparent long-time drift of the
equipment. Values for n were between 0 and 0.06. Spectral overlap
between DAPI and YFP was negligible. The smooth local regression
function m , its derivative mV, and confidence bands for mV were fitted
using the R package locfit (18). A constant bandwidth a = 1 was used
throughout. To determine the intensity t* that corresponds to very
weakly expressing cells we calculated the midpoint of the shorth, which
is the shortest interval that contains half of the ti . As a measure of the
effect, we used the z score, which is the ratio of the estimated slope and
its SE.
z ¼ mˆVðt
Þ
rˆmVðtÞ
Between-well analysis. To obtain a ranking of the proteins, we
compared the set of z scores from the replicate wells for each ORF to the
overall distribution of z scores via the two-sided Wilcoxon test. We
considered an effect significant when P < 0.05. Multiple testing adjustment
for control of the false discovery rate was done following Benjamini and
Hochberg (19).
We provide software for statistical procedures and visualizations through
the package prada , which is part of the bioinformatics platform
Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).
Assay for quantification of anchorage-independent growth. Flat-
bottomed 96-well plates were coated with poly(2-hydroxylethyl methac-
rylate) [poly(HEMA), 120 mg/mL of 95% ethanol] as described (20). Kidney
clear cell carcinoma cells Caki-1 (ATCC HTB-46) and Caki-2 (ATCC HTB-
47) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 %
L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum
(Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Proteins found to activate DNA replication were transfected
into Caki-2 cells to measure their potential to stimulate anchorage-
independent growth of this cell line. Repressors of DNA replication were
analyzed in Caki-1 cells for their potential to reduce anchorage-
independent growth. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 3,500 Caki-1
or Caki-2 cells were spread in each well of the poly(HEMA)-coated plates
in a total volume of 200 AL RPMI 1640. Medium was exchanged after
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the experimental and analysis workflow
in functional profiling. Lists from whole genome tumor microarray studies
(11, 12), and a full-length ORF collection (13, 15) were intersected to select
103 previously uncharacterized proteins for the functional profiling assays.
Data were analyzed only from those expression constructs (NH2-terminal CFP
or COOH-terminal YFP) annotated as expressing correctly localizing proteins.
Statistical analysis determined 16 proteins with significant effect on DNA
replication, which were analyzed in further assays (ERK1/2 activation and
anchorage-independent growth). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(qRT-PCR ) analysis (Taqman) compared gene expression between two
cancer cell lines which differ in anchorage-independent growth. Finally, data
were integrated to annotate the novel cancer-relevant candidate genes and
proteins.

Fukazawa et al. (20).
Results and Discussion
Assay automation. We designed a functional profiling strategy
that took genes that had been associated with cancer by
microarray studies and screened the encoded proteins in tumor
relevant assays (Fig. 1). ORFs of previously uncharacterized genes
were subcloned from publicly available full-length cDNA resources
(13, 21) into expression vectors (15) and transfected into NIH 3T3
cells to overexpress the encoded proteins. All ORFs were fused
to NH2-terminal CFP or COOH-terminal YFP variants of the green
fluorescent protein (GFP), and their expression was monitored
by automated microscopy. The protein localization at the
subcellular level was visually inspected for all constructs (15,
22). This information was used in the subsequent assays, only
data obtained with the relevant expression constructs were
considered (Fig. 1).
A DNA replication assay was fully automated with help of liquid
handling robots and customized statistics software. Transient trans-
fections were carried out in 96-well plates; analysis of protein
overexpression and induced effects was 24 hours later. We applied
automated high-content screening microscopy (17, 23) to achieve a
single-cell resolution (Fig. 2) and traced individual cells within their
microenvironmentofthewell.Werestrictedouranalysistocellshaving
small levels of protein expression tominimize the perturbation of the
cellular system. Whereas we cannot completely rule out nonphysio-
logic effects thatmight be induced by evenminor increases in protein

DNA replication was quantified by monitoring the rate of
BrdUrd incorporation with help of a Cy5-labeled antibody. In
addition, cells were stained with DAPI to facilitate autofocus of the
microscope and to aid the image segmentation algorithm with the
cell finding. Thus, three fluorescence intensities (GFP/YFP, Cy5,

BrdUrd. This is visualized by the local regression
curve, which was calculated based on the data of
nonexpressing and weakly overexpressing cells
only, not regarding cells with signal intensities

cyclin A being an activator of DNA replication.

and DAPI) were recorded for each cell. The effect of the candidate
proteins’ expression on DNA replication was determined by local
regression of the Cy5 signal (BrdUrd) on the GFP/YFP signal
(expression). For each well, this resulted in an estimated regression
slope and a z score that is the estimate standardized by its SE.
Data from replicate wells per protein were summarized by the
Wilcoxon statistic and P value for the comparison of their z scores
to the overall distribution of z scores. This resulted in a ranking
of the proteins for effect strength and a list of 16 proteins with
Ps < 0.05.
Assay performance. The results of all microscopic frames
(19 on average) from within one well were combined, taking into
the account disturbance factors as spectral overlaps and frame-
specific background values. One such frame is shown in Fig. 2A .
The intracellular amount of recombinant protein varied over a
broad range. The majority of cells were either untransfected (cells
left of the midpoint of the shorth in Fig. 2B) or expressed the
protein at low levels (right of the midpoint of the shorth). Few
cells strongly expressed the recombinant protein with signal
intensities of >100 in the YFP channel. A scatterplot of expression
level versus BrdUrd incorporation is shown in Fig. 2C . Even the
population of nonexpressing cells showed a considerable intrinsic
variation in DNA replication as reflected by varying BrdUrd-Cy5
signals. A systematic trend was observed, however, for the
population of cyclin A–expressing cells towards the right end of
the plot: the higher the expression level, the more cells had
incorporated BrdUrd during the experiment. This trend is
visualized by the local regression curve in Fig. 1C . This curve
was calculated based on the data of nonexpressing and weakly
overexpressing cells. Strongly overexpressing cells (e.g., signal
intensity >100 in Fig. 2B-C) were downweighed as in these the level
of recombinant protein could induce nonphysiologic effects (e.g.,
apoptosis). A z score was calculated as a summary of the data for
the cells within one well.
To obtain a visual overview of the protein effects from a 96-
well experiment, we produced plate plots (Fig. 2D). Z scores for
positive (activators) and negative (repressors) slopes are indicated
in color. The red color for cyclin A is indicative of this protein
to be an activator of DNA replication. Interactive versions of
the plate plots are provided in the web supplement (http://
www.dkfz.de/mga/home/fctassay/sphase). Scatterplots similar to
and including the one shown in Fig. 2C can be viewed by
mouse clicking on a well. To assess statistical significance, we
compared the results from multiple wells for the same protein
through histograms of the z scores for both tag orientations
(Fig. 3).
Candidate selection. We selected 103 genes (Fig. 1; Table S1)
for a cellular screen based on the following criteria: (i) their
transcripts were contained in a set of 396 differentially expressed
genes from genome-wide tumor microarray studies (11, 12); (ii)

the encoded proteins had no public functional annotation, other
than from high-throughput projects such as microarray analysis;
(iii) we had determined the subcellular localization of the
proteins (15, 22). This provided an initial piece of information
that connected the proteins to their respective cellular environ-
ment and thus limited their potential for protein interactions.
In addition, use of full-length proteins ensured that all motifs
determining, for example, protein localization, activity, and
regulation were present.
DNA replication assay and functional profiling. Analyzing
the 103 proteins in the BrdUrd incorporation assay, cells were
detected in 2,462 of 2,880 wells. Fluorescence intensities were
recorded for CFP/YFP, Cy5 (BrdUrd), and DAPI signals
individually, resulting in 3  46,221 images. A total of
2,251,739 cells were analyzed, giving over 6.75 million data
points. Sixteen of the 103 proteins showed a significant effect on
the passage through the S phase (individual P < 0.05; false dis-
covery rate <0.16). Seven of these were activators and nine were
repressors of BrdUrd incorporation and thus of DNA replication
(Fig. 3; Table 1). The 16 proteins were then examined for a
possible effect on ERK1/2 activation, to measure effects on G1-S
transition (24). There we found one activating and one inhibiting
protein (Fig. S1; Table 1). Repressors of DNA replication were
further subjected to a poly(HEMA) growth assay to test their
potential to modulate anchorage-independent cell proliferation.
Three proteins were positive in this assay (Fig. 4; Table 1). We
annotated all 16 genes and proteins using tumor microarray
results from Oncomine (ref. 25; Table S1). Taqman RNA
quantification was done in two kidney cancer cell lines (Caki-1
and Caki-2) to refine analysis of the poly(HEMA) assay and was
included in the annotation as well as protein and domain
classifications from Source (26) and Interpro (ref. 27; Table S1).
Together, this integrated data set provided us with candidates
for detailed and ongoing studies. In the following, four such
genes will be described to show the synergy that is achieved
with the functional profiling strategy.
Cancer-relevant cell cycle modulators. The protein encoded
by cDNA DKFZp434P2235, an activator of passage through the
S phase, localizes to the plasma membrane. The corresponding
gene has been independently reported as PRC17 oncogene (28).
Pei et al. found it amplified in 15% of prostate cancers and highly
overexpressed in about half of metastatic prostate tumors. We
found the transcription of the PRC17 (DKFZp434P2235) gene up-
regulated in kidney tumors (Table 1). The gene is also expressed
in the kidney carcinoma cell line Caki-1, which shows anchorage-
independent growth but not in Caki-2 which does not (Figs. S2
and S3). The encoded protein interacts with Rab5 and activates
its GTPase activity (28). Pei et al. discuss that expression of
PRC17 could affect the amount of inactive Rab5, which should
inhibit receptor endocytosis and result in prolonged growth
factor signaling. This hypothesis is consistent with our finding
that the overexpressed DKFZp434P2235 protein promotes DNA
synthesis in the S phase (Fig. 3). Whereas the PRC17 oncogene
takes one candidate from our list of truly novel genes, the
discovery of this protein in the DNA replication assay shows the
power of our integrated approach to identify proteins with
cancer relevance.
The gene for DKFZp566A0646 was found down-regulated in
kidney tumors (Table 1) and to have a lower expression in Caki-1
compared with Caki-2 cells (Fig. S2). The overexpressed protein
inhibited DNA synthesis in the S phase (Fig. 3) and blocked
anchorage-independent growth of Caki-1 cells (Fig. 4). These
findings suggest a repressing effect on tumorigenicity in vitro .
The protein encoded by cDNA DKFZp566A0646 contains a
domain common to the Rab subfamily of Ras small GTPases
(IPR003579). The function of its orthologous protein p34 in rat is
not established; however, in a yeast two-hybrid screen, it was
shown to be a binding partner for the g and a subunits of the
AP1 and AP2 complexes, respectively (29). These adaptor com-
plexes participate in intracellular clathrin-coated vesicle traffick-
ing. We found that Rab5 as well as its effector early endosome
antigen-1 (EEA-1) are down-regulated in kidney tumors (11).
Together with the up-regulation of the Rab5 GTPase-activating
enzyme PRC17, this would imply reduced receptor internaliza-
tion through endocytosis. In addition, Rab GDP-dissociation
inhibitor a (GDIa) was found up-regulated and Rab11b down-
regulated in kidney tumors, supporting the hypothesis that
endocytosis is inhibited in kidney cancer. Changing expression
levels of Rab genes have also been described for other cancer
types (30–32).
The protein encoded by cDNA DKFZp564D152 has 36%
identity over 186 residues with the SET protein of Drosophila
melanogaster (SOURCE; ref. 26), which belongs to the
nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) family. The NAP family
is a group of histone chaperone-like proteins that are known
to be regulators of transcriptional control (33). Nucleosome
assembly and disassembly are essential processes in the S
phase of the cell cycle. In proliferating cells, the synthesis of
histones during the S phase is coupled to DNA synthesis. This
ensures the packing of chromatin. The protein NAP-1 is
thought to be a cell cycle regulator and interacts with
Kap114p (34). That protein is a member of the karyopherin/
importin family, which executes the nuclear import of histone
2A and histone 2B. The activating effect of the DKFZp564D152
protein on DNA replication (Fig. 3), in conjunction with its
nuclear and cytoplasmic localization support the assumption
that it might be involved in cytoplasmic-nuclear transfer of
histones.
The protein encoded by DKFZp434C2415 was found to repress
DNA replication in the S phase (Fig. 3). However, it had a
significant activating effect on ERK1/2 activation in serum starved
as well as in stimulated cells (Table 1; Fig. S1). The protein was
recently described as UBA5, which is an E1-like enzyme in the
ubiquitin degradation pathway (35). Ubiquitin activating enzymes
regulate the rate of ubiquitin conjugation and ubiquitin mediated
protein degradation, which are essential control mechanisms in
the transition from G1 to S phase. Several studies show that cell
cycle regulating proteins are directly targeted for ubiquitin-
mediated destruction through ERK1/2 (36, 37). Thus, DKFZ-
p434C2415 could regulate ERK1/2 activity through ubiquitin
mediated degradation of, for example, phosphatases, the activated
ERK1/2 would then mark cell cycle–regulating proteins for
degradation.
The DKFZp566F123 protein was identified as a BTB/POZ
zinc finger protein (POK protein). The BTB/POZ domain
(IPR000210) mediates protein/protein interaction, whereas the
C2H2 zinc finger (IPR007087) is a DNA-binding domain.
DKFZp566F123 shares closest homology to the transcriptional
repressor BCL-6. The latter protein is involved in hematopoi-
esis, oncogenesis, and immune response (38) and multiple roles
in cell survival and differentiation are described (39). Zhang

et al. hypothesize that the protein encoded by DKFZp566F123
might also be involved in these biological processes and we
found that overexpression of this protein has indeed a
repressing effect on passage through the S phase (Fig. 3).
Thus, we postulate that DKFZp566F123 is a transcriptional re-
pressor that regulates the expression of proteins that are essential
for control of cell cycle progression, and its down-regulation
would lead to enhanced cell growth. Also for other POK
proteins (e.g., the tumor suppressor HIC1; ref. 40), it has been
shown that their inactivation is associated with cell transfor-
mation (39).
Conclusions
We have developed a fully automated cell-based assay that is
designed to identify modulators of DNA replication. It has a
single-cell resolution with exceptionally high sensitivity and
specificity. The assay was applied to narrow down a list of can-
cer associated genes from microarray studies, identifying novel
candidate modulators of the cell cycle. Here we selectively
discerned proteins based on their property to affect a specific
activity of cells (DNA replication); however, this transfection
screen is adaptable for analyzing diverse cellular pathways and
processes.
The endogenous expression of genes in tumor and normal cells
in many cases correlated with the outcome of the DNA
replication assay. For example, the gene encoding cDNA DKFZ-
p434I0515 was found down-regulated in kidney tumor profiling,
whereas it is expressed in normal kidney. Gene expression was
not detectable in Caki-1 and Caki-2 cells. The encoded protein
had repressing effects on DNA replication. Such correlation
should however not be regarded obligatory (41), because cellular
effects of endogenous and overexpressed proteins may be tissue

transiently transfected Caki-1 cells growing in poly(HEMA)-coated plates (transfection efficiency, 90%). MTT reduction (OD ) was measured from days 1 to 6.
B, inhibition of anchorage independent growth. While YFP-transfected Caki-1 cells retained their potential to grow on poly(HEMA) substrate, cells overexpressing
proteins from cDNAs DKFZp566A0646, DKFZp566I133, and DKFZp434G1415 did not survive in this assay.

and cell type specific that are tuned by cellular regulatory
networks.
Depending on the outcome of the initial DNA replication screen
additional assays were carried out with protein subsets to further
characterize the candidates. Whereas it is clear that the described
high-throughput assays do not uncover all molecular and cellular
functions of the respective proteins, they effectively bridge the gap
between gene lists from tumor microarray studies and the capacity
of single gene and protein analysis that is needed to comprehen-
sively characterize a pathway with traditional biochemistry and cell
biology methodologies.
This concept holds the potential for clustering genes based
on their functional profiles (42) and epistatic analyses, to
quantitatively elucidate complex genetic networks. Quantitative
cell-based analysis offers an advantage by permitting the
detection of gene functions that are associated with subtle,
possibly buffered effects. These are basis for the complex
interactions of multiple processes that are involved in the onset
and progression of most diseases (43). Combined with the
mapping of protein interaction networks (44) and other large-
scale cancer relevant assays (45–49), this will lay the ground for
the comprehensive exploitation of genomic resources and
information and ultimately lead to an accelerated functional
understanding of the cellular systems that control health and
disease.
