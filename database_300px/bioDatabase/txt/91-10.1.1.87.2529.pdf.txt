ABSTRACT
Information on protein–protein interactions is
still mostly limited to a small number of model
organisms, and originates from a wide variety of
experimental and computational techniques. The
database and online resource STRING generalizes
access to protein interaction data, by integrating
known and predicted interactions from a variety of
sources. The underlying infrastructure includes a
consistent body of completely sequenced genomes
and exhaustive orthology classifications, based on
which interaction evidence is transferred between
organisms. Although primarily developed for
protein interaction analysis, the resource has also
been successfully applied to comparative genomics,
phylogenetics and network studies, which are all
facilitated by programmatic access to the database
backend and the availability of compact download
files. As of release 7, STRING has almost doubled
to 373 distinct organisms, and contains more
than 1.5 million proteins for which associations
have been pre-computed. Novel features include
AJAX-based web-navigation, inclusion of additional
resources such as BioGRID, and detailed protein
domain annotation. STRING is available at http://
string.embl.de/
INTRODUCTION
A fully comprehensive view of all functionally relevant
protein interactions is still not available for any species, not
even for relatively simple, single-celled model organisms.
However, this information is essential for a systems-level
understanding of cellular behavior, and it is needed in order
to place the molecular functions of individual proteins into
their cellular context.
For detecting direct physical binding between proteins,
numerous small-scale and high-throughput experiments have
been undertaken, and most of their reported interactions
are available from dedicated interaction databases (1–4), as
well as from multipurpose databases centered on specific
model organisms (5–7). However, the growth of interaction
data is severely lagging behind the pace of genome sequenc-
ing, so that for most genomes and proteins known to date
no interaction data is available. Furthermore, proteins do
not only interact physically: indirect associations such as
genetic interactions or shared pathway memberships are
equally important for a complete understanding of cellular
function, but are for the most part not stored in interaction
databases. Instead, they are available from a variety of path-
way databases (8,9) and from the scientific literature.
The database STRING (‘Search Tool for the Retrieval of
Interacting Genes/Proteins’) aims to collect, predict and
unify most types of protein–protein associations, including
direct and indirect associations. In order to cover organisms
not yet addressed experimentally, STRING runs a set of
prediction algorithms (10), and transfers known interactions
from model organisms to other species based on predicted
orthology of the respective proteins (11). STRING has
grown from a purely predictive resource covering mainly
prokaryotes (12) to a comprehensive tool integrating protein
association information from all domains of life (Figure 1).
Each interaction in the database is annotated with a bench-
marked numerical confidence score, which can be used to
filter the interaction network at any desired stringency. All
data in STRING are stored in relational database tables.
The interaction information is freely available for download,
but download of the entire database content requires a license
agreement to prevent redistribution (free for academic users
who only access the previous version number).

KNOWN AND PREDICTED INTERACTIONS
Known interactions in STRING are primarily imported
from existing excellent interaction databases (1–5,8,9), and
are complemented by automated text mining of PubMed
abstracts and several other bodies of scientific text [such as
from Ref. (6)]. As is the case for all interactions in STRING,
imported interactions are mapped onto a consistent set of
proteins and identifiers, thereby facilitating comparison bet-
ween datasets. STRING does not store specific details regard-
ing splicing isoforms or post-translational modifications,
but instead reduces protein isoforms to a single protein per
locus (usually as defined by the longest known protein-coding
transcript). This level of resolution enables efficient storage
and is compatible with most prediction/transfer algorithms,
which usually operate only at the level of the gene locus.
Known interactions are further complemented by de novo
interaction predictions derived from several comparative
genomics prediction algorithms that are mainly applicable
to prokaryotes (13–19). These algorithms systematically
compare genomes, searching for frequently observed gene
neighborhoods, gene fusion events and similarities in gene
occurrence across genomes. For each prediction algorithm,
dedicated viewers of the genomic evidence are available in
STRING.
Interaction evidence from model organisms is often useful
for other organisms as well, especially when orthologs of
interacting proteins can be clearly identified in the second
organism. STRING systematically executes such orthology
transfers, using both precomputed orthologs from the COG
database (20), as well as a homology-based orthology scheme
computed de novo (11). STRING can thus immediately pre-
dict a large number of interactions for any newly sequenced
genome, as soon as it is included into the system. The
combination of known, predicted and transferred interactions
is unique, making STRING the most comprehensive interac-
tion resource available to date, especially for organisms not
addressed experimentally.
The homology data stored in STRING form the basis
for the interaction transfers, and are the result of more than
7 · 1011 pairwise protein comparisons using the sensitive
Smith–Waterman dynamic programming algorithm. This
dataset is a very useful asset in itself [see also (21)], and
can be accessed independently of the protein interaction net-
works by locally installing the STRING database files. Users
of the website can also browse all of the homologs detected
for any protein of interest, and can inspect alignments with
very fast response times (Figure 2).
NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS
IN STRING 7
The network viewer in STRING (Figure 1) is the central
information source and navigation hub for the user. It has
Figure 1. Protein interaction network in STRING. Screenshot from STRING showing a network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins [the exosome complex,
upper right, is seen weakly associated with proteins from nuclear transport, lower left, see also Ref. (26)]. The inset shows the context menu available for all
STRING proteins—in the context menu, annotation and domain architecture are shown directly, and links to other databases and tools are available (22,23). In
the network, links between proteins signify the various interaction data supporting the network, colored by evidence type (see STRING website for color legend).

been extended through a context-sensitive menu-box, which
displays associated information for any protein in the net-
work. This menu includes a graphical summary of protein
domains and features, and allows the user to link out to
other external resources such as the motif discovery tool
DILIMOT (22). STRING is now also tightly integrated with
the SMART protein architecture research tool (23). With
the latter it shares a common set of genomes and proteins,
for which consistent results are pre-computed and stored.
This enables automatic interlinking between both resources
(SMART includes interaction previews, and STRING
includes domain architecture previews). The topology and
evolution of interaction networks can thus be studied both
at the level of proteins as well as at the level of individual
domains.
Since the last update (11), STRING has grown substan-
tially both in terms of data sources and number of organisms
covered. Five new databases are included [MINT, HPRD,
BioGRID, DIP and Reactome (2–5,8)], as well as 194 new
organisms. Especially due to this latter increase in completely
sequenced organisms, the architecture of STRING had to
be substantially upgraded so that it can accommodate present
and future growth. With respect to the user interface, this
required changes in the viewers for the genomic context
data, which could no longer show all of the genomes simul-
taneously by default. Instead, STRING uses a phylogenetic
tree of species to collapse redundant genomes; this tree has
been derived from concatenated alignments of a small
number of universal protein families (24). Users can navigate
the tree by expanding or collapsing its sub-branches, thus
choosing which organisms to focus on. AJAX technology
(‘Asynchronous JavaScript and XML’) is then used to fetch
the requested information into the existing, pre-loaded brow-
ser page, thus increasing useability and speed.
With respect to the underlying database structure, changes
were necessary in the way homology data and interaction
transfers are stored. Both can no longer be computed and
stored in an ‘all-against-all’ fashion, because of their quadra-
tic scaling with the number of genomes. Beginning with
version 7, STRING therefore adopts a two-layered approach
when accommodating fully sequenced genomes (Figure 3):
important model organisms and those for which experimental
data are available form the ‘core genomes’, all other genomes
form the periphery. Within the core, homology searches and
interaction transfers are still executed in an all-against-all
fashion, whereas for peripheral genomes only searches
against the core are included. These and other changes in
STRING dramatically improve the scalability of the resource,
Figure 2. Precomputed homology relations and alignments. For most genomes contained in STRING, sensitive all-against-all homology searches using the
Smith–Waterman algorithm are included. These form the basis for assigning orthologs and transferring interaction information, but are also available directly to
the user. Because they are stored in a relational database, access to homologs and alignments for any protein of interest is possible without the usual waiting time.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 00, Database issue D3
leading to faster update cycles even when the number of
sequenced genomes is to increase as fast as currently pro-
jected. Together with future plans to increase the scope and
specificity of the stored interaction information, STRING
should thus continue to facilitate not only network research
but also wider projects that range from phylogenetics to
metagenomics (24,25).

Figure 3. Organisms covered by STRING. STRING currently contains 373
fully sequenced organisms. These are divided into ‘Core Organisms’ and
‘Peripheral Organisms’. The former include all important model organisms
for which experimental data are available, as well as selected representatives
for cases of redundant genome sequencing (e.g. when several closely related
strains of a bacterial species have been sequenced, only one strain is
included). The ‘Peripheral Organisms’ form the remainder; they tend to be
somewhat redundant, and usually have little more than genomic sequence
information annotated. For the core organisms, homology relations and
interaction transfers are fully computed, whereas the peripheral organisms are
only connected to the core but not among themselves (the graphic shows
only a small selection of organisms; lines indicate homology searches and
interaction transfers). This architecture allows STRING to encompass all
sequenced genomes, while still keeping database size and computation time
within reasonable limits.
