Abstract
An unbiased screen for genes that can immortalize mouse
embryonic fibroblasts identified the glycolytic enzyme
phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). A 2-fold increase in PGM
activity enhances glycolytic flux, allows indefinite prolifer-
ation, and renders cells resistant to ras-induced arrest.
Glucosephosphate isomerase, another glycolytic enzyme,
displays similar activity and, conversely, depletion of PGM
or glucosephosphate isomerase with short interfering RNA
triggers premature senescence. Immortalized mouse embry-
onic fibroblasts and mouse embryonic stem cells display
higher glycolytic flux and more resistance to oxidative
damage than senescent cells. Because wild-type p53 down-
regulates PGM, mutation of p53 can facilitate immortaliza-
tion via effects on PGM levels and glycolysis. (Cancer Res
2005; 65(1): 177-85)
Introduction
The metabolism of cancer cells differs significantly from that of
normal cells (1). Cancer cells are able to maintain high rates of
aerobic glycolysis even under the high-oxygen (20%) conditions of
normal tissue culture. This property, known as the ‘‘Warburg effect,’’
has been recognized for over 70 years (2) and is exploited clinically in
the detection of primary tumors and metastases based on positron-
emission tomography measurement of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-
glucose uptake (3). Moreover, several recent studies have shown
that enhanced glycolysis is a distinctive marker of cancer
progression (4, 5), and a correlation has been noted between the
expression of oncogenes such as ras , myc , or src and enhanced
aerobic glycolysis (1). However, despite the undisputed significance
of the Warburg effect in cancer, there have been few mechanistic
insights into its relationship with the well-characterized molecular
and genetic alterations associated with cellular immortalization.
Under standard conditions of tissue culture, normal somatic
cells achieve a limited number of population doublings before
entering a growth-arrested state known as replicative senescence
(6, 7). In cells deficient in telomerase, a principal determinant of
senescence is the loss of telomeric repeat sequences that occurs at
each division. Damaged telomeres eventually register as a form of
DNA damage (8) triggering among other things a p53-mediated cell
cycle arrest (9). However, it is clear that telomere-independent
mechanisms are also important (10). For example, primary mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEF) lose proliferative capacity after only 10 to
20 population doublings despite having exceptionally long
telomeres. In this setting, the growth arrest is generally attributed
to the stresses imposed by culture conditions (11), but the
molecular details are poorly understood.
At least one of the stresses seems to be oxygen poisoning
because it has been noted that the life span of mouse and human
fibroblasts can be extended by culturing them under low-oxygen
conditions (12, 13). Conversely, deliberate oxidative stress, for
example, with low doses of hydrogen peroxide, can elicit a
senescence-like arrest (14), and the production of reactive oxygen
species seems to underlie the premature senescence phenotype
induced by oncogenes such as ras (15). Mouse cells seem to be
particularly sensitive to oxidative stress but also escape from the
ensuing growth arrest at a relatively high frequency. Almost all of
the immortal cell clones that emerge have defects in either p53 or
one of its upstream regulators or downstream effectors (16, 17), in
line with a direct involvement of p53 in the response to oxidative
stress (18).
Using an unbiased genetic screen for cDNAs that confer
immortality in MEFs, we identified the muscle form of phospho-
glycerate mutase (PGM-M). Whereas overexpression of PGM or
glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), another glycolytic enzyme, can
enhance glycolysis and bypass senescence, depletion of PGM or
GPI was found to shorten cellular life span. PGM-immortalized
MEFs show increased resistance to oxidative DNA damage and ras-
induced arrest. Interestingly, mouse embryonic stem cells, which
are highly resistant to oxidative stress despite an apparently
normal p53 response, also show high levels of glycolysis. Our
findings suggest that the Warburg effect may reflect a mechanism
for escaping the restrictions to cellular life span caused by
oxidative stress.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Retroviral Infection. Primary MEFs were isolated
from 13.5-day postcoitum embryos of CD1 or C57BL/6 mice as described
previously (19). The cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies,
Gaithersburg, MD) with 10% FCS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Mouse
embryonic stem cells were cultured as described by Smith et al. (20).
All retroviruses were produced by transfecting the relevant plasmid DNA
into the LinXE packaging cell line (21) and infections were conducted in
the presence of 8 Ag/mL polybrene. Infected cells were selected in
hygromycin (75 Ag/mL), blasticidin (1 Ag/mL), or G418 (400 Ag/mL) as
appropriate. After 8 to 10 days of selection, cultures were propagated
according to a 3T3 protocol as described previously (19). Briefly, every

3 days cells were trypsinized and replated at 106 cells per 10-cm plate.
Cells were plated onto 24-well plates for growth curves (19) or into 10-cm
dishes for 2V,7V dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) staining. Soft
agar assays were done as described (22).
Plasmids and Retroviral cDNA Libraries. A mouse embryonic cDNA
library was constructed from pooled RNA prepared from total mouse
embryos at days 7 and 15, mouse embryo heads at day 15, and adult mouse
brain and testis.5 The cDNAs were cloned into the pHygro MarX II retroviral
vector (21). Full-length cDNAs for the brain-specific form of PGM (PGM-B,
accession no. BC005661), GPI (NM008155), PGK1 (NM008828) and ENO1
(XM109407) were isolated by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) using total
RNAextractedfromp53/MEFsandclonedintopHygroMarXII.Humanp53175H
p53175H (p53DN), human liver phosphofructokinase (NM002626; ref. 23), and
three PGMmutants generated by PCR mutagenesis were also subcloned into
pHygro MarX II.
Small Interfering RNA Experiments. All small interfering RNAs
(siRNA) were purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO)
(Supplementary Table A). Mouse and human PGM siRNAs were designed to
target both muscle and brain forms. Mutant PGM siRNA with a single
nucleotide substitution was designed. Because there is no overlapping
sequence in the two isoforms of mouse phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), we
designed separate PGK siRNAs to target the two isoforms and transfected
them as a 1:1 mixture.
Wild-type MEFs were seeded at 0.5  106 cells per 10-cm dish and
cotransfected with 4 nmol of the respective siRNA and fluorescein-labeled
GL2 siRNA in the presence of oligofectamine as recommended by the
supplier (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Transfection efficiency was calculated
by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. Semiquantative RT-PCR was
done as below. ATP levels were measured by ATP bioluminescent somatic
cell assay kit (Sigma) as described previously (24).
Glycolyic Enzyme Assay and Flux Measurement. The activities of
PGM, GPI, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), PGK,
and enolase were measured spectrophotometrically at 37jC as described
(25). For the PGM assay, 20 Ag of cell lysate were incubated with NADH
(0.2 mmol/L), ADP (3 mmol/L), 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (10 Amol/L),
lactate dehydrogenase (600 milliunits), pyruvate kinase (500 milliunits),
and enolase (100 milliunits) at 37jC for 10 minutes. Then 3-
phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA) (1 mmol/L final concentration) was added
as substrate. Activity was measured as NAD+ release through 40 minutes
as monitored by A340 nm in a Spectra max plus (Molecular Devices,
Menlo Park, CA).
The method used to determine glycolytic flux was based on the
metabolism of D-[3-3H]glucose into water after the triose phosphate
isomerase reaction (23). Cells were plated at 0.7  106 cells per 10-cm dish
the day before analysis. Feeder-independent mouse embryonic stem cells
were replated on gelatin-coated dishes 1 day before the assay. Eleven hours
later, the medium was changed from high glucose (17 mmol/L) to low
glucose (4.25 mmol/L) and D-[3-3H] glucose was added 10 hours later. Every
2 hours, 400 AL of medium were taken for perchloric acid precipitation. The
supernatant was applied to DOWEX 1X8 200-400 MESH Cl (Sigma) resin
after dilution in sodium tetraborate. All the values were normalized by
protein content.
Glucose consumption and lactate production in the culture medium
was measured by the Infinity glucose reagent and lactate kit, respectively
(Sigma).
Measurement of Oxidative Damage. Cells were stained with DCF
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (15). Cells were
loaded with 5 Ag/mL DCF for 5 minutes, washed twice in PBS, and
immediately analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
The analysis of 8-hydroxy-2V-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) content in
DNA was done by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as
described previously (26), using genomic DNA from 3  106 to 5  106
cells at different passages. The levels of 8-OHdG were expressed as
the number of 8-OHdG adducts per 1 million deoxyguanosine bases in
the samples.
RNA and Protein Analysis. Total RNA was extracted from MEFs and
from adult muscle and brain using the Trizol reagent. Northern blotting was
done using standard protocols (27). Probes specific for the M or B isoforms
of PGM were prepared by RT-PCR.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR was done by using SuperScript one-step RT-
PCR kit (Invitrogen) as described (19). After DNase treatment, indicated
RNA extracts were used as template. All primers designed are shown in
Supplementary Table B.
TGP53-4, p53/ MEFs bearing tetracycline-inducible p53GFP, was used
as described previously (27). Twenty-four hours after addition of 1 g/mL
doxycycline to the medium, cells were arrested whose extract was subject to
PGM assay and Western blotting.
p53/ MEFs were transfected with various plasmids by Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) as follows: PGM-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (0.5 mg)
and GFP (0.5 mg) with increasing amounts of p53 (0.5, 1, or 2 mg) or with
vector, Mdm2 , or p53RFP (1 mg). Total DNA amounts were adjusted by
vector DNA up to 4 mg. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were
extracted for Western blotting. For Western blotting, cell lysates were
prepared as described (19) and resolved on polyacrylamide gels.
Immunoblotting was done using antibodies against Mdm2 (SMP14 from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), actin (A5316 from Sigma), GFP
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and ubiquitin (clone FK2 from Affinity Research,
Plymouth Meeting, PA, which can detect ubiquitinated proteins but not
free ubiquitin).
Results
PGM Can Bypass Replicative and ras-Induced Senescence in
MEFs. Wild-type CD1MEFs were infected at passage 4 with amouse
embryonic cDNA library in the pHygroMarX II retrovirus vector (21).
Human p53175H (a dominant negative allele, designated p53DN) in
the same vector was used as a positive control to validate the screen
(19). A total of 24 immortal clones were obtained from over 107
infected cells. Because the pHygroMarX II vector has a LoxP site that
becomes duplicated in the long terminal repeats of the provirus,
candidate retroviruses were recovered by treating the genomic DNA
of each surviving clone with Cre recombinase and retested for their
ability to immortalize primary MEFs. Among the rescued cDNAs
that allowed bypass of senescence in this assaywe found a full-length
clone encoding PGM-M.
As shown in Fig. 1A , a retrovirus encoding PGM-M conferred
unlimited proliferation on primary MEFs with an efficiency
comparable to that of p53DN. Superinfection with a retrovirus
encoding Cre recombinase, which will excise the integrated proviral
DNA, reversed the senescence bypass in cells immortalized by PGM-
Mor p53DN, but had no effect on spontaneously immortalizedMEFs
(3T3 cells) infected with the empty pHygroMarx II vector (Fig. 1B).
This confirms that PGM-M immortalization of MEFs is a single
genetic event. We also confirmed that PGM-M can immortalize
MEFs from C57BL6 mice, excluding some genetic predisposition
in the CD1 strain (data not shown). Both PGM- and p53DN-
immortalized MEFs underwent a senescence-like arrest upon
ectopic expression of p16Ink4a or p19Arf, implying that they had not
sustained mutations in the effector pathways required for senes-
cence (data not shown).
We also examined the ability of PGM-M to protect cells
against premature senescence induced by oncogenic ras (28).
Wild-type MEFs (at passage 6) rapidly arrested upon infection
with a retrovirus encoding ras-Val12, whereas MEFs expressing
either PGM-M or p53DN (at passage 8) continued to proliferate5 W. Bordogna and D. Beach, unpublished data.

vigorously in the presence of ras-Val12 (Fig. 1C). However,
whereas oncogenic ras caused neoplastic transformation of
the p53DN-expressing cells, as expected (22, 29, 30), the PGM-
M–expressing MEFs did not acquire the ability to form colonies
in soft agar, and are thus not fully transformed (Fig. 1D). These
data suggest that PGM-induced immortalization is not equiva-
lent to that conferred by loss of p53 .
PGM Activity Is Required for Immortalization of MEF. In
glycolysis, PGM catalyses the transfer of phosphate from
3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate (Fig. 2A). The enzyme
functions as a dimer and has been highly conserved throughout
evolution. Mammals express two isoforms, designated as PGM-M
(muscle form) and PGM-B (brain form) based on their relative
abundance in these tissues (31). Northern blotting using cDNA
probes for the two mouse isoforms indicated that PGM-B is
much more abundant than PGM-M in cultured MEFs (Fig. 2B).
MEFs transduced with ectopic PGM-M showed relatively
physiologic levels of expression, but MEFs immortalized by
p53DN showed no significant up-regulation of PGM-M or PGM-B
mRNA (Fig. 2B).
Mouse PGM-M is 43% and 53% identical to its counterparts in
fission and budding yeast, respectively, and all of the catalytically
important residues identified in the crystal structure of yeast
PGM are conserved in mouse PGM-M and PGM-B (refs. 32, 33;
Fig. 2C). In MEFs infected with retroviruses encoding either
PGM isoform, the total PGM activity was increased approxi-
mately 2-fold relative to the endogenous levels in uninfected
cells (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Importantly, PGM-B was also
able to immortalize MEFs, although the cells showed consis-
tently slower growth rates than parallel cultures expressing
either PGM-M or p53DN (data not shown). These results imply
that the total PGM activity is important for immortalization,
rather than a specific attribute of the PGM-M isoform.
As further confirmation, we mutated critical residues in PGM-
M that are required for catalytic activity. Residue R90 is required
for catalytic activity, whereas R90, R116, and R117 are involved
in substrate binding (32). These residues were individually
mutated by PCR-based mutagenesis, as shown in Fig. 2C , and
each mutant allele was transferred into the pHygroMarX II
vector and used to infect early-passage MEF cells. All of the
mutations were shown to ablate or substantially reduce the
enhancement of PGM activity conferred by wild-type PGM-M
(Fig. 2C). When the infected cells were passaged according to a
3T3 protocol, only the wild-type PGM-M resulted in efficient
bypass of senescence, as shown by both increasing cell numbers
(Fig. 2D) and senescent-associated h-galactosidase staining (data
not shown). The R90Q, R116Q, and R117Q mutations were
completely inactive in these assays. Thus, we concluded that
PGM activity is required for immortalization of MEFs. Interest-
ingly, the R116Q and R117Q mutations seemed to promote
rather than alleviate senescence, as compared to MEFs infected
with the empty vector control (Fig. 2D and data not shown).

Immortalization Correlates with Effects on Glycolysis.
Because the most likely consequence of excess PGM activity
would be enhanced glycolysis, we investigated whether other
glycolytic enzymes were capable of immortalizing MEFs. Ectopic
GPI showed a similar effect on cell proliferation as PGM-M (Fig.
3A), and PGK reproducibly showed an intermediate effect with
sustained cell proliferation but at a reduced rate compared with
PGM-M. The other glycolytic enzymes tested had little if any
effect, as judged by population doublings and senescent-
associated h-galactosidase staining (Fig. 3A and data not shown).
A potential explanation for these differences is that the
introduction of exogenous PGM-M and GPI resulted in a
significant increase in glycolytic flux.
The production of 3H2O from [3-
3H]glucose is catalyzed by
aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase, several steps
upstream of PGM (see Fig. 2A), but at glucose concentrations
of <20 mmol/L, the rate of detritiation of [3-3H]glucose is similar
to that of lactate production and can therefore be used as an
indicator of glycolytic flux (34). In passage 8 MEFs, ectopic
expression of GPI or PGM-M increased the rate of glucose
detritiation approximately 2-fold compared with control cells
infected with the empty vector (Fig. 3B , filled bar). An analogous
effect was noted on the ratio of lactate production to glucose
consumption (Fig. 3B , open bar), suggesting that these enzymes
were indeed capable of stimulating glycolytic flux. In contrast,
phosphofructokinase and enolase had no impact on these
parameters. The results imply a correlation between the ability
of glycolytic enzymes to enhance glycolysis and their ability to
bypass senescence in MEFs.
Inhibition of Glycolytic Enzymes Can Induce Senescence. If
glycolysis can facilitate the bypass of senescence, we reasoned
that inhibition of glycolysis should provoke premature senes-
cence. Short interfering RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA) against
mouse PGM, GPI, GAPDH and PGK were therefore tested for

their effect on the proliferation of early-passage MEFs. In the
case of PGM, the siRNA was designed to target both isoforms.
However, the existence of multiple isoforms precluded efficient
knockdown of phosphofructokinase and enolase. Transfection
efficiencies were f30% (data not shown). Under these
conditions, each siRNA reduced the respective endogenous
mRNA level and enzymatic activity by f40% to f50% (Fig.
3C , bottom and top , respectively). Importantly, siRNA against
PGM had no effect on the activity of GPI and vice versa (data
not shown). One nucleotide substitution in PGM siRNA,
designated mutant PGM siRNA (Supplemental Table A), abol-
ished this effect (Supplemental Fig. C). Both control siRNAs,
scramble, and fluorescein-labeled GL2 siRNA, showed no
significant effect on each enzyme activity and cell growth (data
not shown). Despite the relatively modest effects, the siRNA
against either PGM or GPI inhibited proliferation (Supplemental
Fig. A), reduced the cellular ATP content by 34% and 19%,
respectively (data not shown), and induced premature senes-
cence as assessed by senescent-associated h-galactosidase
activity (Fig. 3D). Even 5 days after transfection, cells transfected
with PGM- or GPI-siRNA displayed a highly senescent morphol-
ogy (Supplemental Fig. B). In contrast, the siRNA against GAPDH
had no effect on cell behavior despite reducing the activity of
the enzyme. The partial effects seen with PGK siRNA are
reminiscent of the intermediate effect of ectopic expression of
the cDNA recorded in Fig. 3A . These observations are in line
with the idea that modulation of some but not all glycolytic
enzymes can influence cell proliferation via effects on glycolysis.
Enhanced Glycolysis in Spontaneously Immortalized MEF.
We next asked whether enhanced glycolysis is a general feature
of immortal cells. Primary MEFs were passaged on a 3T3
protocol until immortal segregants grew out after passage 12
(Fig. 4A , top). Interestingly, glycolytic flux, as measured by glu-
cose detritiation, declined as the culture senesced and then rose
again coincident with spontaneous immortalization (Fig. 4A , top).
Total PGM activity increased approximately 2-fold in the
immortal segregants, analogous to the increase observed upon
ectopic expression of PGM-M in Fig. 2C , and a similar trend was
noted for PGK and enolase activity (Fig. 4A , bottom). In nine
separate 3T3 MEF cultures allowed to undergo spontaneous
immortalization, PGM activity was invariably elevated relative to
the senescent population (data not shown).
To further investigate the apparent correlation between
enhanced glycolysis and immortality, we measured glucose
detritiation and total PGM activity in the CGR8 mouse embryonic
stem cell line. These cells are feeder cell–independent and
proliferate indefinitely without apparent genetic damage. As shown
in Fig. 4B , CGR8 cells showed enhanced glycolytic flux and
concomitant elevation in total PGM activity relative to early-
passage MEFs. Embryonic stem cells also display an elevated
lactate/glucose ratio. Similar results were obtained with the DE3
strain of mouse embryonic stem cells (data not shown).

Potential Links between PGM and p53 Function. Because
spontaneous immortalization of MEFs generally involves disrup-
tion of the p53 pathway (17), and p53DN enables MEFs to escape
senescence (Fig. 1A), we were interested in exploring the
mechanisms that might connect p53 function with PGM activity.
MEFs expressing p53DN showed a relatively modest but
significant increase in PGM activity compared with vector-only
controls (Fig. 5A). This was accompanied by similar increases in
glucose detritiation and lactate production. In a reciprocal
context, tetracycline regulated expression of wild-type p53 (GFP
tagged) in the TGP53-4 mouse cell line (27) caused a significant
decline in endogenous PGM activity (Fig. 5B). Immunoblotting
confirmed the induction of p53-GFP and its ability to activate
expression of Mdm2 .
These results suggest that p53 is able to down-regulate PGM,
but we did not observe a change in PGM mRNA levels following
the introduction of p53DN (Fig. 2) or wild-type p53 (data not
shown). To further investigate these effects, we cotransfected
p53/ MEFs with a GFP-tagged PGM (PGM-GFP) and
increasing amounts of p53 . Under these conditions, we observed
a marked and dose-dependent reduction in the level of PGM-
GFP (Fig. 5C) consistent with reduced translation or stability. In
line with this idea, we noted that ectopic expression of PGM-
GFP in wild-type MEFs resulted in the appearance of a higher
molecular weight form of the protein (Fig. 5D , asterisk). This
slower migrating form was detected more clearly after N-
acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-norleucinal (a proteasome inhibitor)
treatment of the cells (data not shown). When immunoprecipi-
tated via the GFP epitope, the higher molecular weight form was
detectable by immunoblotting with an antibody against ubiquitin
(Fig. 5D). However, PGM levels were unaffected by either Mdm2
or p53RFP, two ubiquitin ligases that are known to be regulated
by p53 (refs. 35, 36; data not shown).
Oxidative DNA Damage in Immortalized MEFs. It is now
appreciated that under standard conditions of tissue culture (i.e., in
20% oxygen), oxidative stress has a major impact on cellular life
span. Growing cells under reduced-oxygen conditions can delay
senescence and it has recently been reported that MEFs are
essentially immortal and show less oxidative DNA damage if
propagated in 3% oxygen (13). We hypothesized that under
normoxic conditions, enhanced glycolysis by ectopic PGM or GPI
might protect MEFs from effects of oxidative damage.
To evaluate this possibility, we subjected MEFs infected with
the empty vector control or with retroviruses encoding PGM-M,
p53DN, and CGR8 (mouse embryonic stem cells) to stress induced
by hydrogen peroxide. CGR8 cells proved to be remarkably
resistant to oxidative stress, showing only marginal effects on
viability at hydrogen peroxide concentrations as high as 100 Amol/L
(Fig. 6A). In comparison, MEFs showed severe loss of viability
even at low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. MEFs express-
ing PGM-M or p53DN were significantly more resistant to hy-
drogen peroxide than the controls infected with the empty vector
(Fig. 6A).
We also compared cytosolic reactive oxygen species production
in these cells by staining with DCF. As previously reported (18), the
p53DN-expressing cells showed reduced DCF staining (Fig. 6B).
The PGM-M- or GPI-expressing MEFs also had significantly less
DCF staining than vector control cells at passage 8 and passage 12
(Fig. 6B ; Supplemental Fig. D and data not shown). These results
indicate that PGM or GPI expression can reduce reactive oxygen
species production in the cells during serial culture. Because
oncogenic ras can also stimulate reactive oxygen species
production (15), we examined the effect of oncogenic ras on
reactive oxygen species production in PGM or wild-type MEFs. We
found that oncogenic ras induced less DCF staining in PGM-M
MEFs compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 6C), in line with our
findings that PGM-immortalized MEFs are resistant to arrest by
oncogenic ras (Fig. 1C). To directly assess whether these effects
could protect the cells from oxidative damage, we compared the
levels of 8-OHdG, which is one of the most abundant types of DNA
lesions caused by oxidative damage (37), in the genomic DNA
by HPLC (Fig. 6D). The vector control cells showed an f2-fold

increase in 8-OHdG levels between passage 8 and passage 12,
consistent with the accumulation of oxidative DNA damage as
cells approach senescence (Fig. 6D). Introduction of PGM or GPI
did not prevent the accumulation of 8-OHdG but reduced the levels
by about 2-fold at each passage. Taken together, these data are
consistent with the notion that PGM or GPI can protect cells from
the senescence effect of oxidative damage under normal oxygen
culture conditions.
Discussion
Here we have established that early-passage MEFs have high
glycolytic activity, which declines during replicative senescence
and is reestablished during spontaneous immortalization. That
this pattern is more than correlative is evidenced by the iden-
tification of PGM-M in a genetic screen for cDNAs that
overcome senescence and the demonstration that a 2-fold
increase in enzyme activity can reversibly immortalize MEF.
The most tenable explanation is enhanced glycolysis, rather than
some previously unrecognized property of PGM, because
catalytically inactive mutants of PGM-M had no effect on life
span, whereas GPI, which lies six catalytic steps upstream in the
glycolytic pathway (Fig. 2A) can also immortalize MEFs.
Furthermore, inhibition of either of these two enzymes triggers
premature senescence. Most interestingly, mouse embryonic stem
cells, which do not senesce in vitro , display naturally high levels
of PGM activity and glycolysis even at ambient 20% O2 (see
below). Thus, they display the Warburg effect.
The regulation of PGM is poorly understood, although PGM
activity is known to be greatly up-regulated in many cancers,
including lung, colon, liver, and breast (38, 39). Most glycolytic
enzymes are transcriptionally regulated by the hypoxia-inducible
transcriptional factor HIF-1a (40). Interestingly, PGM and GPI
were the only exceptions noted in a study of 15 glucose
transporter and glycolytic genes in HIF1a null embryonic stem
cells (40). In cardiac myocytes, PGM-M is a direct transcriptional
target of p53 (41), but we did not find evidence for
transcriptional control of PGM-M or PGM-B in MEFs (Fig. 2B
and data not shown). We did find a potential link between PGM
protein level and p53 function (Fig. 5). However, as PGM cannot
overcome a cell cycle arrest induced by ectopic p53 (data not
shown), the role of p53 in senescence cannot be explained solely
by effects on PGM down-regulation.
Our observations can be encompassed by a simple hypothesis
that incorporates much other experimental support. A correla-
tion between glycolysis, reactive oxygen species, and cell
proliferation has been clearly established in human thymocytes
(42). Similarly, it has been shown that MEFs in culture at 20% O2
are subject to oxygen poisoning and senescence can be avoided
by growing most MEF strains in 3% O2 (13). Switching cells from
3% to 20% O2 conditions can promote senescence (13), and in
human fibroblasts senescence can be mimicked experimentally
by exposing cells to low doses of hydrogen peroxide (14, 43). We
propose that the high glycolytic rate of early-passage MEFs
partially protects against oxidative damage, but that oxidative
stress eventually inhibits glycolysis. Immortalization of MEFs

thus follows glycolytic activation, which can be mediated directly
with PGM or GPI, indirectly with p53DN, or as a consequence of
spontaneous abrogation of the p53 pathway. Glycolytic activation
protects from oxidative damage, and we hypothesize that the
constitutively active glycolytic pathway observed in embryonic
stem cells at atmospheric O2 conditions contributes to their
immortal characteristics even though they present a robust p53
response to DNA damage (44, 45).
Although it is widely held that tumors are highly glycolytic,
even in 20% O2 conditions in vitro , because they have adapted to
survive in relatively anoxic conditions in vivo , we suggest rather
the contrary. Mitogenic stimulants and activated oncogenes,
such as ras-Val12, produce reactive oxygen species that are
thought to be functionally important for the downstream
signaling mechanisms (46, 47). Glycolytic activation may
therefore protect against oxidative damage caused by reactive
oxygen species production of mitogenic bombardment in vivo . In
effect, the tumor can resist damaging free radical production.
Thus, in a small or well-vascularized tumor, glycolytic activation
may be an early and essential step in tumorigenesis. A tumor
that subsequently becomes anoxic by outgrowing its vasculature
is also presumably well served by active glycolysis.
At present the Warburg effect is exploited clinically for tu-
mor imaging by positron-emission tomography scanning of
2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (5). Because tumors, whether
anoxic or not, are likely to be highly glycolytically dependent
(48), it may be worth exploring antiglycolytic agents that do not
cross the blood-brain barrier as potential cancer therapeutics.
Although it has been suggested that the activity of complex
metabolic pathways cannot be modulated by the abundance of a
single component enzyme (49), our studies reveal the unexpect-
ed ease with which the glycolytic flux of mammalian cells can be
genetically manipulated, at least in MEFs. Genetic or pharma-
ceutical modulation of the glycolytic pathway might also have an
effect on animal life span, as our data support the rate-of-living
oxygen radical theory of cellular and organismal aging (50). Of
more immediate practical impact is the potential to develop
immortal mouse cell lines in which the p53 and pRb pathways
have been functionally preserved and to further dissect the links
between p53 , PGM, and glycolysis.
