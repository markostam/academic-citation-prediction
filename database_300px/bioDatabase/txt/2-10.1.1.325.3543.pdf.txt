Abstract Three genes, fibrinogen-

encode proteins that make up the mature FBG protein com-
plex. This complex is secreted from the liver and plays a
key role in coagulation in response to vascular disruption.
We identified all three FBG genes in a screen designed to
isolate genes that are regulated by the farnesoid X receptor
(FXR; NR1H4). Treatment of human hepatoma cells with
either naturally occurring or synthetic [3-(2,6-dichlorophe-

-carboxy-2-chloro-stilben-4-yl)-oxymethyl-5-isopro-
pyl-isoxazole] FXR ligands resulted in the induction of tran-
scripts for all three genes. The induction of FBG

 mRNA in
response to activated FXR appears to be a primary tran-
scriptional response, as it is blocked by actinomycin D but
not by cycloheximide. Four FXR isoforms were recently
identified that differ either at their N termini and/or by the
presence of four amino acids in the hinge region. Interest-
ingly, the activities of the human FBG

 promoter-reporter
constructs were highly induced by FXR isoforms that lack
the four amino acid insert.  The observation that all three
FBG subunits are induced by specific FXR isoforms, in re-
sponse to FXR ligands, suggests that bile acids and FXR
modulate fibrinolytic activity.

Secretion of fibrinogen (FBG) from hepatocytes into
the blood is a key component of the coagulation pathway
that ultimately leads to the formation of a fibrous clot in
response to vascular disruption (1). The mature FBG pro-
tein is a hexamer that is formed from disulfide-linked
equimolar ratios of three peptides encoded by the FBG
 

 
,
-

, and -

 genes (2). FBG expression is restricted almost
entirely to the hepatocyte (3). In response to disruption
 
of the vasculature, a signaling cascade originating from
either the intrinsic or the extrinsic coagulation pathway
leads to the activation of thrombin, which then cleaves
small peptides, termed A and B, from the FBG hexamer,
allowing fibrin to form (3). Fibrin can self-associate to
form filaments that aggregate to form a meshwork of in-
terconnected thick fibers that are a critical component of
the clot (3). The activation of thrombin, and thus the pro-
duction of fibrin, is regulated by a series of enzymes that
respond to disruption of the vasculature to initiate the
blood coagulation process (3). The production of fibrin is
also regulated at the transcriptional level by expression of
the FBG


 
, and -
 

 
 genes in the hepatocyte (4).
The three FBG genes are clustered in a 65 kb region on
human chromosome 4 (5, 6). Hepatic-specific expression is
achieved by the requirement for the liver-enriched transcrip-
tion factor HNF-1 (7, 8). Expression of the three FBG genes
is tightly regulated in a coordinated manner so that the ex-
pression of all three genes is induced in response to the same
signal (9). Induction of rat and human FBG mRNAs occurs
as part of the acute phase response that is activated by in-
terleukin-6 (IL-6) and glucocorticoid signaling pathways
(9–11). The coordinated regulation of all three FBG genes
in response to IL-6 and glucocorticoids is achieved by the
presence of distinct transcription factor binding sites flank-
ing each of the three FBG genes rather than through a single
common regulatory element (4, 10, 11).

FXR regulates fibrinogen expression 459
 
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NRIH4) is a member
of a subclass of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily
of transcription factors that form heterodimers with a
common partner, the 9-
 
cis
 
 retinoid X receptor (RXR).
Such transcription factors function by binding to 
 
cis
 
-act-
ing response elements located within the promoters, in-
trons or enhancers of their target genes, and regulate
gene expression, usually in response to the binding of
small lipophilic ligands (12). Studies with a limited num-
ber of RXR heterodimers suggest that ligands induce a
conformational change of the nuclear receptor that pro-
motes the release of corepressor proteins and the subse-
quent recruitment of coactivator proteins; the net result is
increased transcription of the target gene (13, 14).
Differential use of two distinct promoters of the single
FXR gene, coupled with alternative mRNA splicing, re-
sults in the formation of four FXR isoforms (FXR

(15, 16). The 
 

 
1 and 
 

 
2 isoforms are distinguished from
the 
 

 
3 and 
 

 
4 isoforms by a truncated N terminus. The
FXR
 

 
1 and -
 

 
3 isoforms contain a four amino acid insert
in the hinge region that is absent from both FXR
 

 
2 and
-
 

 
4 (15, 16). The four isoforms differ in their tissue distri-
bution and induce the expression of partially overlapping
sets of targets (15, 17).
In 1999, three groups independently reported that spe-
cific bile acids are ligands for human and rat FXR (hFXR
and rFXR, respectively) and as such bind to and activate
FXR at physiologically relevant concentrations (18–20).
The most potent of these natural ligands is the primary
bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (18–20). These
observations have helped to define a new physiological
function for bile acids as metabolically derived regulators
of gene expression.
High levels of FXR expression are limited to the liver,
intestine, kidney, and adrenals, with low levels reported in
the stomach, fat, and heart (15, 16, 21). However, with the
exception of the intestinally expressed ileal bile acid bind-
ing protein (I-BABP) gene, all other FXR target genes re-
ported to date were identified from analysis of hepatic tis-
sue or cells (22). Hepatic FXR target genes fall into a
limited number of groups. One group, which includes the
ABC transporters BSEP (21, 23), multidrug resistance-
associated protein 2 (MRP2) (24), multidrug resistance
protein, MDR3 (human) (25), and rodent Mdr2 (26), to-
gether with the fibroblast growth factor-19 (27) and the
small heterodimeric partner (SHP) (28–31), functions to
decrease hepatic bile acid concentrations by increasing
export and decreasing bile acid synthesis. A second group
of FXR target genes encode proteins that influence lipo-
protein levels in the serum and decrease plasma triglycer-
ides (17, 22, 28, 32–35). The identification of this latter
group of FXR target genes may help explain the molecu-
lar mechanism underlying the observations that adminis-
tration of chenodeoxycholate to humans resulted in de-
creased plasma triglyceride levels (36). Activated FXR also
has a hepatoprotective role (26, 37) and regulates genes
involved in gluconeogenesis (38). In a recent report, FXR
was also shown to induce the human kininogen gene, sug-
gesting a role in anticoagulation (39). In addition, the
microarray data reported by Downes et al. (40) suggest
that there may be numerous other hepatic FXR target
genes that modulate diverse biochemical pathways still to
be elucidated. Surprisingly, the latter microarray data also
suggest that three structurally unrelated FXR ligands,
CDCA, 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-(3
 

 
-carboxy-2-chloro-stil-
ben-4-yl)-oxymethyl-5-isopropyl-isoxazole (GW4064), and fex-
aramine, regulate distinct subsets of hepatic genes (40).
In an effort to identify new FXR target genes and define
new signaling pathways by which bile acids influence gene
expression in the hepatocyte, we performed a microarray-
based screen of RNA populations from HepG2 hepatoma
cells that overexpress FXR and compared expression
profiles from cells that were treated with FXR agonists or
vehicle. Here, we report the identification of three novel
FXR targets (FBG
 

 
, -
 

 
, and -
 

 
). These data suggest an un-
expected link between bile acid signaling and fibrinolytic
activity, and this represents a new paradigm for bile acid
function.

Cell culture and stable cell lines
 
The generation and maintenance of HepG2 and stably infected
HepG2-rFXR or HepG2-Neo cells have been described (42).
HuH7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s me-
dium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CV-1 cells
were maintained as described (15).
 
RNA isolation and Northern blot hybridization
 
Unless otherwise indicated, HepG2 and HuH7 cells were cul-
tured in medium containing superstripped FBS for 24 h before
the addition of ligands or Me

SO (vehicle) for an additional
8–24 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and was re-
solved (5–10

g/lane) on a 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel,
transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N
 


sciences, Inc.), and cross-linked to the membrane with ultravio-
let light. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [

P]dCTP using
the Rediprime™ II labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).
Membranes were hybridized using the QuikHyb hybridization so-
lution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Blots were normalized for variations of RNA
loading by hybridization to a control probe, either 18S ribosomal
cDNA or the ribosomal protein 36B4. The RNA levels were quan-
titated using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software; Molecu-
lar Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).

fore RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis. The relative levels of BSEP mRNA are shown. Values for FBG, -, and - mRNAs did not dif-
fer significantly from the chow fed wild-type mice.

 by natural and synthetic 
FXR ligands
 
As detailed in previous reports (24, 42), we screened for
target genes that are regulated by the bile acid receptor
using HepG2 that were infected with retroviral vectors
expressing either rFXR
 

 
2 and the neomycin-resistant
gene (HepG2-FXR) or the neomycin-resistant gene alone
(HepG2-Neo). Total RNA was isolated from HepG2-Neo
or HepG2-FXR cells that had been treated for 24 h with
vehicle (Me
 
2
 
SO), the FXR ligand CDCA (100 
 

 
M), or the
synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 (1 
 

 
M). These RNA sam-
ples were then used to prepare biotinylated cRNAs that
were hybridized to high-density microarrays containing
 

 
6,000 cDNAs/expressed sequence tags (Affymetrix HuFL
Gene Chip). This approach identified several genes, in-
cluding those encoding FBG
 

 
, -
 

 
, and -
 

 
, whose mRNAs
appeared to be induced by treatment of the cells with
either natural or synthetic FXR ligands. Other genes iden-
tified by this approach, including apolipoprotein C-II
(apoC-II), syndecan-1 (SDC1), and MRP2, have been re-
ported elsewhere and are involved in either bile acid or
lipoprotein transport and metabolism (17, 24, 42). We
chose to explore the regulation of the FBG genes by FXR
because their function in clotting represents an entirely
new signaling paradigm that potentially links coagulation
and clotting to bile acids.
Initially, we used Northern blot analyses to confirm that
FBG mRNAs were induced in response to FXR ligands;
HepG2-FXR cells were treated with the FXR ligands CDCA
(100 
 

 
M) or GW4064 (1 
 

 
M) or the RXR synthetic ligand
LG100153 (100 nM) for 24 h. Treatment with FXR ligands
resulted in a 2- to 5.9-fold induction of transcripts from all
three FBG genes (
 
Fig. 1A
 
). Because GW4064 has been
shown to be highly specific for FXR (41), these data sug-
gest that induction of FBG
 

 
, -
 

 
, and -
 

 
 is dependent upon
activation of FXR. Addition of the RXR ligand LG100153
also resulted in the induction of all three FBG mRNAs
(Fig. 1A).
The studies described above used HepG2 cells that sta-
bly overexpress rFXR. To determine whether FBG tran-
scripts are induced in HepG2 cells that do not stably over-
express high levels of FXR, we treated HepG2-Neo cells
with GW4064 or the RXR ligand LG268 (RXR agonist) in
the presence or absence of CDCA (Fig. 1B). Treatment
with these FXR and RXR ligands led to a marked in-
duction of FBG
 

 
 and -
 

 
 mRNAs, although only minor
changes were noted for FBG
 

 
 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the induc-
tion of FBG mRNAs in HepG2 cells in response to FXR/
RXR ligands is not dependent on stable overexpression
of rFXR.
To ensure that the induction of FBG by FXR ligands is
not limited to a single hepatoma HepG2 cell line, we also
isolated RNA from human hepatoma HuH7 cells after
24 h of treatment with the FXR (CDCA or GW4064) and/
or RXR ligands. Figure 1C shows that the all three FBG
transcripts were induced after treatment with FXR ligands.
The RXR ligand LG100153 led to a relatively low level of
induction of FBG transcripts. ApoC-II is a known FXR tar-
get and served as a positive control (Fig. 1C).
At pathological concentrations, bile acids can act as
ligands for a second nuclear receptor, the pregnane X re-
ceptor (PXR). To rule out the possibility that the induc-
tion of FBG mRNAs observed upon treatment of HepG2-
FXR cells was attributable to the activation of PXR rather
than FXR, we treated HuH7 cells with the PXR-specific
ligand rifampicin. Figure 1C shows that the addition of
rifampicin at two different concentrations failed to induce
mRNAs for FBG transcripts. Taken together, the data pre-
sented in Fig. 1 indicate that the induction of mRNAs for
Fig. 2. The induction of FBG mRNA by FXR ligands does not
require protein synthesis. HepG2-FXR cells were treated for 8 h
with 100 M CDCA with or without 100 nM LG100153 or 1 M
GW4064 in the presence () or absence () of cycloheximide
(CX; 10 g/ml), as indicated. RNA isolation and Northern blot
analysis were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. SHP,

all three chains of human FBG is specifically induced in
response to FXR ligands.
To examine whether FBG transcripts are also induced
in murine liver in response to FXR activation, we fed wild-
type and FXR null mice a standard chow or chow supple-
mented with 1% cholic acid for 5 days. Total liver RNA
was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot. As expected,
expression of BSEP, a known FXR target gene (21), was
induced when the wild-type mice were fed the diet sup-
plemented with cholic acid, whereas BSEP mRNA levels
were low in the FXR null mice and were not induced by
cholic acid (Fig. 1D). The data in Fig. 1D show that he-
patic FBG transcript levels were similar in both wild-type
and FXR null mice and were unchanged after administra-
tion of the diet supplemented with cholic acid (Fig. 1D).
These data indicate that the murine FBG gene is not re-
sponsive to FXR. The observation that FBG mRNAs are
induced by FXR ligands in two human hepatoma cell
types, but not in the livers of mice fed an FXR ligand, sug-
gests that the induction of the three FBG genes is species
specific.

FBG
 

 
, considered to be the nucleating chain for FBG
assembly (4, 43), was the most highly induced of the three
FBG genes in response to FXR ligands (Fig. 1). Conse-
quently, subsequent studies focused on FBG
 

 
. To deter-
mine whether mRNA induction is a primary response that
occurs in the absence of protein synthesis, we treated
HepG2-FXR cells with vehicle or FXR ligands for 8 h in
the presence or absence of cycloheximide before harvest-
ing RNA. The Northern blot data shown in 
 
Fig. 2
 
 demon-
strate that induction of FBG
 

 
 mRNA by FXR ligands is in-
dependent of protein synthesis. The superinduction of
FBG
 

 
 mRNAs noted in the presence of cycloheximide was
also observed for SHP, a well-characterized primary target
gene of FXR/RXR (Fig. 2).
 
Induction of FBG mRNAs by FXR ligands is attenuated by 
actinomycin D
 
We next treated HepG2-FXR cells for 8 h in the pres-
ence or absence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA
Fig. 3. Induction of FBG mRNA by FXR ligands is attenuated by an inhibitor of transcription. A: Actino-
mycin D (ActD) prevents the FXR ligand-dependent induction of FBG. HepG2-FXR cells were cultured in
the presence of actinomycin D (5 g/ml) for 20 min before the addition of vehicle (Me2SO) or 100 M
CDCA with or without 100 nM LG100153 (a synthetic RXR agonist), as indicated. After 8 h, total RNA was
isolated, and Northern blot analysis performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B: The half-life of FBG
mRNA is unaffected by FXR ligands. Cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of vehicle (Me2SO) or
GW4064 (1 M). Actinomycin D (5 g/ml) was then added (0 h) to all dishes, and RNA was isolated after
the indicated times. The relative mRNA levels for FBG and SHP were determined from Northern blot as-
says and the data plotted for vehicle-treated (open circles) or GW4064-treated (closed circles) cells.

half-life of FBG is greater than 8 h and is not significantly
affected by GW4064 treatment (Fig. 3B). The finding that
FBG mRNA levels decline by 	20% after 8 h precludes
an accurate determination of the half-life, as such studies
would necessarily involve incubation of the cells in the pres-
ence of actinomycin D for 24 h. Such conditions are toxic
to cells. Nonetheless, based on the data in Fig. 3B, the rapid
induction of FBG mRNA in response to FXR ligands
(Figs. 1, 2) cannot result from stabilization of the FBG
mRNA. Figure 3B also shows that the SHP mRNA half-life is
4 h and is also unaffected by GW4064 treatment. Based
on the results shown in Figs. 1–3, we conclude that the in-
duction of FBG mRNAs is dependent on increased tran-
scription of the gene in response to activated FXR.
The FBG promoter is responsive to FXR
Previous studies have shown that IR-1 (an inverted re-
peat with a 1 bp spacer), ER-8 (an everted repeat with an
8 bp spacer), and DR-1 (a direct repeat with a 1 bp spacer)
arrangements of the traditional nuclear hormone recep-
tor binding hexad can function as farnesoid X receptor
response elements (FXREs) (24, 44–46). Computer-assisted
analysis of 10 kb of the published nucleotide sequence up-
stream of the transcriptional start site of all three human
FBG genes failed to identify any sequences that corre-
spond to a putative IR-1, ER-8, or DR-1 response element.
To determine if the proximal FBG promoter is respon-
sive to FXR-mediated transcription, 2.5 kb of the FBG
proximal promoter was cloned into a luciferase reporter
to produce pGL3-FBG-2500. This reporter was cotrans-
fected into HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of
plasmids encoding RXR and either rFXR2 (which lacks
the four amino insert) or the constitutively active VP16-
hFXR2 fusion protein. The data shown in Fig. 4A show
that cotransfection of the reporter pGL3-FBG-2500 with
FXR, followed by treatment with the FXR agonist GW4064,
led to a 2- to 5.5-fold induction of luciferase activity com-
pared with cells not treated with ligand and/or not trans-
fected with plasmids encoding FXR and RXR. Luciferase
activity was induced to even greater levels when cells were
cotransfected with pGL3-FBG-2500 and a plasmid encod-
ing the constitutively active VP16-hFXR (Fig. 4A).
Fig. 5. Transactivation of the human FBG promoter by FXR is isoform specific. Triplicate dishes of
HepG2 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding one of the four murine FXR isoforms (FXR1, -2,
-3, or -4), RXR, and reporter genes under the control of either the human FBG proximal promoter
(pGL3-FBG-2500) or two copies of the IR-1 (inverted repeat with a 1 bp spacer) farnesoid X receptor re-
sponse element (FXRE) from the human phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) gene upstream of a minimal
promoter (pTK-2x-PLTP). The presence (12) or absence (12) of the 12 bp/4 amino acid insert in the
hinge region is indicated for clarification. After transfection, cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or

Anisfeld et al. FXR regulates fibrinogen expression 465
In an attempt to localize the critical cis element in the
FBG promoter, we constructed a series of reporter genes
containing 5 deletions and transiently transfected these
into HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B). The data show that successive
5 deletions resulted in a stepwise decrease in reporter
activity (Fig. 4B). The addition of GW4064 activated re-
porter genes containing from 2,172 to 2,500 bp of the
FBG promoter but failed to activate genes containing
1,700 bp (Fig. 4B). Extensive additional studies failed to
identify a bona fide FXRE between 2,281 and 1,700 bp
of the FBG promoter. Consequently, we conclude that
transcriptional activation of the FBG gene by ligand-acti-
vated FXR likely depends upon multiple cis elements in
the proximal promoter, thus making it difficult to identify
the FXRE.
Induction of FBG by FXR is isoform specific
Alternate splicing and promoter use produces four FXR
isoforms from the single mFXR and hFXR genes (15, 16).
Some FXR target genes, including SHP, BSEP, and phos-
pholipid transfer protein (PLTP), are transcriptionally ac-
tivated to similar levels by all four isoforms (15). Other
genes, including I-BABP (15) and SDC1 (17), are acti-
vated in an FXR isoform-specific manner (15, 17). To ex-
plore the possibility that FBG is induced by FXR in an
isoform-specific manner, we cotransfected cells with the
pGL3-FBG-2500 luciferase reporter RXR and individual
mFXR isoforms and then treated the cells with the FXR-
specific ligand GW4064. As shown in Fig. 5A, luciferase ac-
tivity was highly induced in cells cotransfected with plas-
mids encoding FXR2 or -4 and treated with GW4064.
In contrast, GW4064 treatment did not increase luciferase
activity in the presence of either FXR1 or -3 (Fig. 5). In
the presence of GW4064, all four FXR isoforms are capa-
ble of activating appropriate target genes, which include a
luciferase reporter under the control of IR-1 elements
from the PLTP gene (Fig. 5B) (15). Luciferase activities
from the empty pGL3 and Tk vectors were low and unaf-
fected by these treatments (Fig. 5C, D). Taken together,
the transfection data indicate that the FBG proximal
promoter contains elements that control transcriptional
induction of the gene in response to either the FXR2 or
-4 isoform.
The mechanistic basis for the isoform-specific induc-
tion of some FXR targets is not fully understood. The dif-
ference may involve different DNA binding properties of
the four isoforms, differential association of the isoforms
with coactivator proteins, or other factors. Previous re-
ports have suggested that the inability of FXR isoforms 1
and 3 (which contain the four amino acid insert MYTG)
to induce the expression of I-BABP is attributable, at least
in part, to impaired binding to the FXRE in the promoter
of the I-BABP gene (15). It is reasonable to consider that
the location of the four amino acid insert, directly adja-
cent to the DNA binding domain, may account for this ob-
servation. Despite extensive studies, we have been unable
to identify the response elements responsible for FXR-
mediated induction of the FBG gene. This precludes

studies that would directly assay the ability of various FXR
isoforms to bind a critical FXRE necessary for FBG in-
duction. Consequently, we generated plasmids that en-
code either VP16-hFXR1 or VP16-hFXR2. The two
fusion proteins contain the same VP16 transactivation do-
main at the carboxyl terminus and differ only by the inclu-
sion/exclusion of the four amino acid insert (Fig. 6). We
hypothesized that the recruitment of coactivators to both
isoforms would be similar because they both contain the
potent VP-16 transactivation domain.
HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the pGL3-
FBG-2500 luciferase reporter plasmids and, where in-
dicated, plasmids encoding RXR, FXR2 (MYTG),
VP16-hFXR1 (MYTG), or VP16-hFXR2 (MYTG). As
expected from earlier results, the pGL3-FBG-2500 re-
porter was induced when cells were cotransfected with
FXR2 and then treated with GW4064 (Fig. 6). Cotrans-
fection of this reporter with a plasmid encoding the VP16-
hFXR2 (MYTG) fusion protein led to an even higher
induction of reporter activity, which occurred in the ab-
sence of ligand (Fig. 6). In contrast, cotransfection of
the same reporter with a plasmid encoding VP16-hFXR1
(MYTG) failed to induce reporter activity in the pres-
ence or absence of an FXR ligand (Fig. 6). pTK-2x-PLTP
served as a positive control and, as expected (15), was in-
duced by ligand-activated FXR and by both VP16-hFXR
constructs even in the absence of added ligand (Fig. 6).
As both VP16-hFXR1 and VP16-hFXR1 fusion proteins
contain the same highly active VP16 activation domain, it
is unlikely that the differences in reporter activation po-
tential on the pGL3-FBG-2500 reporter are attributable
to differences in coactivator recruitment. Rather, the data
suggest that the different activation profiles of pGL3-FBG-
2500 in response to the two VP16-hFXR fusion proteins is
likely the result of differences in binding of FXR/RXR to
a response element in the FBG promoter. Identification
of the this element will be necessary to confirm this hy-
pothesis.
Studies described in Figs. 5, 6 used mFXR isoforms. The
data in Fig. 7 show that the human FBG promoter-reporter
gene was also induced by ligand-activated hFXR isoforms
that lack the MYTG motif but was unresponsive to the
MYTG-containing isoforms. These data suggest that the
hFXR and mFXR isoforms are functionally interchange-
able in such transient transfection assays.
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates that activation of FXR
in human-derived liver cells results in the induction of
FBG, -, and - mRNAs. The proteins encoded by the
three FBG genes form an equimolar hexamer that consti-
tutes the mature FBG complex (3). FBG is synthesized al-
most exclusively in the hepatocyte and is secreted into the
blood as part of the acute phase inflammatory response
(4, 11, 16). FBG expression is known to be activated by IL-6
and glucocorticoids (7, 9). The current data demonstrate
that hepatic FBG mRNAs are also induced after activation
of FXR. Because FBG is involved in the formation of fi-
brin, our data suggest that bile acids may also activate the
fibrinolytic system. Interestingly, this response appears to
Fig. 7. Isoform-specific transactivation of the human FBG promoter is preserved when using different
hFXR isoforms. Triplicate dishes of CV-1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding one of the hFXR
isoforms (FXR1, -2, -3, or -4), human RXR, and reporter gene under the control of the human FBG
proximal promoter (pGL3-FBG-2418) (A) or the empty pGL3 plasmid (B). After transfection, cells were

be human/primate specific, because murine hepatic FBG
mRNA levels did not increase after activation of FXR (Fig.
1D). In other studies, Zhao et al. (39) demonstrated that
FXR activated the human kininogen gene, and it was pro-
posed that FXR and bile acids have a role in vasodilation
and anticoagulation. Additional studies will be necessary
to determine the effect of FXR activation on coagulation
in humans.
The findings that hepatic FBG, - and - mRNAs were
induced in response to multiple FXR ligands, including
the natural ligand CDCA or low levels of the synthetic
FXR agonist GW4064, suggest that this response is not
simply an inflammatory response caused by a toxic com-
pound. This conclusion is supported by the observation
that the PXR ligand rifampicin did not elicit the induc-
tion of FBG mRNAs.
Analysis of the FBG promoter failed to identify any
motifs corresponding to traditional FXREs. Cotransfec-
tion of a promoter-reporter construct containing 2.5 kb of
the FBG promoter with FXR and RXR, followed by treat-
ment with FXR ligands, indicated that the FBG pro-
moter is responsive to ligand-bound FXR. In addition, ac-
tivated transcription of FBG is a primary response and
thus independent of protein synthesis. Our attempts to
use deletion analysis to further localize the response ele-
ment necessary for this induction have been complicated
by an apparent complex system of regulation that may in-
volve several cis elements that act in an additive or syner-
gistic manner to induce the expression of FBG mRNA.
Further analysis of the promoter will be necessary to con-
clusively define the molecular mechanism by which FXR
activates transcription of the FBG genes.
Four FXR isoforms are transcribed from the mFXR and
hFXR genes. The four isoforms differ in both their tissue
distribution and their ability to activate the expression of
FXR targets (15, 16). Thus, although some FXR target
genes (PLTP and SHP) respond similarly to all four
isoforms, others (I-BABP and SDC1) are highly induced
in response to FXR isoforms that do not contain the four
amino acid insert and are either less responsive or entirely
unresponsive to the isoforms that do contain this insert
(15). The current data indicate that FBG belongs to the
second class, because FBG promoter-reporter construct
activity was highly induced in response to cotransfection
with constructs encoding mFXR or hFXR 2 and 4
isoforms (which lack the four amino acid insert) but were
unresponsive to constructs that contain this insert (FXR1
and -3). These results expand the subset of genes that re-
spond to ligand-bound FXR in an isoform-specific man-
ner. Furthermore, cotransfection assays using plasmids
encoding constitutively active VP16-FXR fusion proteins
demonstrate that isoform specificity is maintained in the
face of a potent heterologous transactivation domain. These
results, coupled with previous reports, suggest that the
mechanistic basis for the isoform-specific response of the
FBG promoter to FXR is attributable, at least in part, to
differential DNA binding between isoforms that either
contain or lack the four amino acid insert in the hinge re-
gion.
Our observations that bile acids and FXR induce mRNAs
for all three genes necessary for the formation of mature
FBG define a new functional paradigm for FXR signaling.
Studies that explore the consequences of increased he-
patic expression of FBG would help to shed light on an
unexpected link between cholesterol metabolism and fi-
brogenesis. To our knowledge, there are no reports that
link serum bile acid levels in humans with FBG levels. As
high serum FBG levels are known to be a risk factor for
the development of atherosclerosis (1, 47), this study sug-
gests unexpected consequences of activating FXR as a
means of reducing plasma triglyceride levels.
