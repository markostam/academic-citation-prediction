[1] We describe a new inversion algorithm developed for the retrieval of atmospheric
constituents from Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) solar
occultation measurements. The methodology differs from the operational (NASA)
algorithm in several important ways. Our algorithm takes account of the finite altitude
and spectral resolution of the measurements by integrating over the viewing window
spectrally and spatially. We solve the problem nonlinearly by using optimal estimation
theory, and we use an aerosol parameterization scheme based on eigenvectors
derived from existing empirical and modeled information about their microphysical
properties. The first four of these eigenvectors are employed in the retrieval algorithm to
describe the spectral variation of the aerosol extinction. We retrieve ozone and nitrogen
dioxide number densities and aerosol extinction from transmission measurements at
41 channels from 0.29 to 1.55 mm. In this paper we describe the results of the gas
retrievals. Numerical simulations test the accuracy of the scheme, and subsequent
retrievals from SAGE III transmission data for the period between May and October 2002
produce profiles of O3 and NO2. Comparisons of the O3 and NO2 profiles with those
obtained using the SAGE III operational algorithm and with those from independent
measurements made by satellites, ozonesondes, and lidar indicate agreement in ozone
measurements in the middle and upper stratosphere significantly closer than the natural
variability and agreement in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere approximately
equal to the natural variability.

1. Introduction
[2] In solar occultation experiments, the attenuation of
the sun’s radiation is recorded by satellite instruments as
the satellite orbits the earth and views the sun during
each orbital sunrise and sunset. Transmission can be
recorded at many wavelengths in the ultraviolet through
the infrared. In this work we consider the Stratospheric
Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) instrument
in particular, in which solar transmission is measured in
87 spectral channels between 290 nm and 1.55 mm
[SAGE III ATBD Team, 2002b]. Because the satellite
views the sun along a slant path through the atmosphere,
the problem of retrieving vertical profiles of the atmo-
spheric constituents is twofold. Slant path measurements
at different tangent heights (during a sunrise or sunset)
can be used together with geometrical considerations to
give information on the vertical distribution of constitu-
ents, and, with knowledge of the absorption cross section
of the atmospheric gases in each spectral channel, the
Rayleigh contribution to scattering from the air molecules,
and some information regarding the spectral dependence of
the aerosol attenuation, spectral information from the array
of channels can be used to separate the contributions from

each constituent. Thus both spatial and spectral inversions
must be carried out.
[3] The errors in the retrieval of these atmospheric con-
stituents are the result of a variety of factors including
imperfect knowledge of instrument characteristics (e.g.,
signal noise, aperture shape, and location of measurement
channels), imperfect information regarding satellite location
and measurement time, errors in the a priori information
(e.g., absorption coefficients of different gases), and the
inversion method employed (e.g., algorithms for inverting
the measured transmission data, and methods for determin-
ing the tangent height and accounting for the Sun’s ‘‘dark-
ening’’ toward the disk edge). Many of these aspects depend
on the particular instrument, and those that can be are
quantified as far as possible before launch.
[4] In order to separate the contributions of the various
gases and the aerosols from the total attenuation in each
channel, some assumption must be made about the optical
characteristics of the aerosols. In earlier work, an optimal
parameterization scheme for describing the spectral depen-
dence of the aerosol extinction was developed and tested in
a series of simulations in which a wide range of strato-
spheric aerosol conditions was modeled [Timofeyev et al.,
2003]. This paper describes the algorithm developed for the
retrieval of atmospheric gas concentrations, in particular for
NO2 and ozone. The algorithm is based on work developed
for and applied to the Ozone-Mir spectrometer on board the
Mir space station [Poberovskii et al., 1999; Polyakov et al.,
1999, 2001a].
[5] We describe our application of this scheme to the
inversion of transmittance measurements made by the
SAGE III spectrometer between May and October 2002
and present vertical profiles of ozone and nitrogen dioxide
obtained with our algorithm. These retrievals are compared
with those obtained from the operational (NASA) SAGE III
algorithm and with independent measurements made by
other satellite instruments, ozonesondes and lidar.
2. Retrieval Algorithm
[6] In a solar occultation experiment, the sun’s radiance,
J(li, hj), at spectral channel i with wavelength li, is
recorded as a function of tangent height, hj and given by
J li; hj

where j and y are the spectral and angular slit functions
of the device, and Dh and Dl are the altitude and spectral
resolutions of the device. I(l, J) is the intensity of solar
radiation at the observation angle, J, and t(l, h) is the
atmospheric optical depth. The exoatmospheric radiance,
J0(li), is then given by

The ratio of these two functions gives the slant path
transmittance of the atmosphere. Assuming that the
intensity of the solar radiation I(l, J), is constant within
the width of each channel, this is given by

where S is the slant path through the atmosphere at tangent
height h, ds is an element of this path, z(s) is the altitude of
the slant path, and k(l, z) is the total coefficient of
extinction and attenuation due to all gases and aerosols and
comprises the O3 and NO2 absorption coefficients, ko3 and
kNO2, and Rayleigh and aerosol extinction coefficients,
aRayleigh and aaerosol. Equations (3) and (4) are the basis for
formulating and solving the nonlinear inverse problem with
respect to retrieving vertical profiles of ozone concentration,
NO3(z), nitrogen dioxide, NNO2(z), and aerosol extinction,
aaerosol(z). This method is slow because of the necessity of
carrying out both spectral and angular integration, and
differs from the method used for routine processing of the
SAGE III measurements [SAGE III ATBD Team, 2002b] in
which it is assumed that the atmospheric transmittance
function can be approximated by the exponential depen-
dence from the atmospheric optical depth t(li, hj) averaged

where k(li, z) is the mean effective absorption coefficient
for the spectral interval under consideration at the relevant
tangent height. Another difference between our inversion
algorithm (referred to as the SPbSU algorithm) and the
SAGE III operational (NASA) algorithm is in the treatment
of aerosols. In our method, the aerosol extinction
coefficient is approximated by a linear expansion in terms
of basis functions which were derived from numerical
modeling using a large database of aerosol size and
composition. These basis functions are optimal in the sense
that the fewest number of terms are required to model the
greatest part of the expected variability in the measured

aerosols [Polyakov et al., 2001b; Timofeyev et al., 2003;
Virolainen et al., 2004] The aerosol extinction coefficient,
aaerosol(l, z), is thence approximated by the expansion,
aaerosol l; zð Þ ¼ aaerosol lð Þ þ

where aaerosol(l) is the mean function of the spectral
dependence of aerosol extinction averaged over all
altitudes, and Wk(l), k = 1, 4 are the first four eigenvectors
of the spectral covariance matrix. Statistical aerosol models
were used to define these. These models are based on a
large database that includes volcanic and background
aerosols, and aerosols of many different sizes and
compositions. For a full description see Timofeyev et al.
[2003]. Thus four parameters, ak(z), must be retrieved to
describe aerosol extinction at each altitude.
[7] The Rayleigh contribution to the extinction is calcu-
lated using well-known formulae on the basis of the tem-
perature and pressure profiles given in the SAGE III level 1b
data [SAGE III ATBD Team, 2002a]. The temperature-
dependent contributions to the total optical depth from
ozone and NO2 are derived from the O3 and NO2 absorption
cross sections given by Bass and Paur [1984], Burkholder
and Talukdar [1994], and Schneider et al. [1987].
[8] In order to solve the set of equations we discretize the
continuous altitude functions to a finite dimensional repre-
sentation using the SAGE III altitude grid (0–100 km with a
0.5 km step) and combine all (p = 6) parameters to be
determined in a vector x. This vector thus comprises the gas
number density vectors, NO3 and NNO2, giving gas concen-
tration at each altitude, and the four aerosol expansion
coefficients, ak(z), at each altitude,

[9] We solve the retrieval problem through optimal esti-
mation [Rodgers, 2000]. For this nonlinear problem the nth
iteration of the solution vector x^n is obtained by iterating
from the a priori vector xa according to Rodgers [2000],
Polyakov [1996], and Lumpe et al. [1997],

where y = [T(l1, h1), T(l2, h1),. . .., T(lm, h1), T(l1, h2),. . ..,
T(lm, h2), T(l1, hl),. . .., T(lm, hl)] is the vector of
transmission measurements at m wavelengths and l altitude
values. These transmission data have associated with them
an (ml x ml) covariance matrix Sy, with diagonal elements
set to be the assumed error variances at each wavelength-
altitude combination. Off-diagonal elements of Sy are
assumed to be zero.
[10] The a priori vector xa was derived from climatolog-
ical mean profiles [Anderson et al., 1986]. In the case of O3
a midlatitude summer profile was used, and for NO2, the
global mean profile. Sa is the (1200  1200) a priori
covariance matrix, used to constrain the retrieval. Cross
correlations between components (O3, NO2 and aerosol) are
assumed to be absent. The a priori covariance matrix, Sa,
was thus constructed from three diagonal square cells—one
for each of O3, NO2 and aerosol. For the gases the elements
of Sa are given by
S hi; hj

where N (h) is the mean profile of the gas number density
and s(h) is its standard deviation (set to be 0.6 N (h) for O3
and 1.0 N (h) for NO2). r is the correlation radius, which we
set to 5 km. A priori information for the aerosols (mean
profiles and the covariance matrix of ak(z)) and the quasi-
empirical orthogonal basis set, Wk(l), were determined by
numerical simulation of the aerosol variability [Polyakov et
al., 2001a; Timofeyev et al., 2003; Virolainen et al., 2004].
The (ml  pl) kernel (or Jacobian) matrix Kn is the
derivative of the transmission with respect to the (pl)
retrieval parameters, x:

These elements are derived from the forward model (3)
which relates the transmission, T, to the gas concentrations
through (4). Kn was calculated numerically at each iteration
using exact analytical expressions. Iteration is allowed to
proceed until a convergence criterion is met based upon the
smallness of the difference xk+1  xk. According to theory
(assuming normally distributed random errors) the uncer-
tainty in the retrieval parameters is then given by the
covariance matrix of the solution errors, S^:
S^ ¼ S1a þ KTS1y K
 1
: ð11Þ
[11] In reality convergence is difficult to achieve as the
steps tend to oscillate around the solution. Thus an extra term
was added to the function to be minimized on the basis of
the difference, xk+1  xk, to help in reaching convergence.
The details of this are described in Appendix A. The retrieval
of vertical profiles of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and aerosol
extinction was carried out as described above using 41
channels of the SAGE III measurements. We omitted the
290 nm and 384 nm channels, which we believe may
overestimate transmittance below 55 km and below 30 km
respectively, and also omit from consideration the oxygen
and water vapor bands at 758–770 nm and 933–960 nm.
[12] One of the important characteristics of remote sens-
ing measurements is the vertical resolution of the retrieved
atmospheric constituents. This vertical resolution is deter-
mined not so much by the altitude grid applied in the
retrieval as by the peculiarities of radiation transfer through
the atmosphere in the region of interest—in our case, by the
spatial distribution in altitude of the attenuating atmospheric
layers. The algorithm for solving the inverse problem also
influences to some degree the vertical resolution of the
retrievals. To determine the vertical resolution in our case,
we calculated the widths of the averaging kernels [see, e.g.,
Rodgers, 2000] for the inverse operator of our retrieval
algorithm. These values were close to 1.5 km, even though
we use an altitude step of 0.5 km in the retrievals. Thus

laminated structures with a width of less than about 1.5 km,
which might occur in the gas profiles, will not be seen in
our retrieved profiles since such fine structured oscillations
will be smoothed out with a sliding average over a width of
about 1.5 km.
3. Numerical Simulations
[13] In order to study the potential errors associated with
using our algorithm to retrieve the gaseous and aerosol
composition of the atmosphere from SAGE III transmission
data [SAGE III ATBD Team, 2002a], we carried out a
number of closed-loop numerical simulations as described
in detail by Polyakov and Timofeyev [2003a, 2003b]. A base
model of the atmosphere was generated from three different
mean climatic ozone profiles, one for each of the tropics, the
middle latitude winter, and the subarctic winter. A mean
global profile was used for NO2, and a background aerosol
extinction profile was generated from an ensemble of
aerosol size distributions [Polyakov et al., 2001b; Timofeyev
et al., 2003]. Typical profiles of temperature and pressure
were taken from SAGE III data. Atmospheric transmittance
functions for this base model at the SAGE III measurement
channels were then generated using our forward model, and
measurement error estimates from a typical SAGE III event
added to these using a random number generator. These
transmittance functions were then used as input to the
inverse problem and the retrieved O3, NO2 and aerosol
extinction profiles compared with the exact (known) values
to estimate retrieval errors. This cycle of calculating the
forward model and performing the inverse task was repeated
with a variety of atmospheric conditions to evaluate the
performance of our scheme and the propagation of experi-
mental error into the results.
[14] Table 1 lists the different atmospheric conditions
used in the numerical experiments and the corresponding
retrieval errors. The last column of the table gives the chi-
square statistic which measure the goodness of the fit, and is
given by

 	2vuut , where Tmeas and
Tcalc are the measured and modeled transmittances, and sij
are the estimated errors in the measured transmittances. For
retrievals which meet the error criteria exactly, the chi-
square statistic has the value 1.
[15] Row 0 corresponds to the base model described
above. For this case, the O3 retrieval errors are approxi-
mately 5% throughout the stratosphere and mesosphere, and
for NO2 the errors are 6% between 20 and 45 km. The next
simulation shows the result of doubling the NO2 content.
This change leads to a decrease in the NO2 relative retrieval
error from 6 to 3.4% and no change in the O3 retrieval error.
Subsequent rows show the influence of varying the noise
realization from the standard used in the base model,
changing the aerosol loading and parameterization, and
introducing an error in the altitude. Row 2 shows the
influence of a different noise assignment to the measure-
ments; row 3 uses a more turbid atmosphere—which affects
not only the aerosol extinction error but also increases gas
retrieval errors to 12% for stratospheric ozone and 8.6% for
NO2 as a result of the decrease in atmospheric transmit-
tance. Row 4 shows the case of a different background
aerosol, and produces similar errors to the base model.
Rows 5 and 6 show the effect on the retrieval errors, of
reducing the number of independent parameters describing
the aerosol extinction (the number of terms in equation (7)).
In row 5, the solution of the inverse problem is performed
using only three rather than four parameters, in row 6 this is
further reduced to just two parameters. It is seen that
decreasing the number of parameters to three has little
effect on the retrieval errors, but the tightening of the
constraint increases the systematic errors (or relative resid-
ual). The fit is still relatively good with three parameters,
but with only two parameters, the fit is much worse.
Retrieval errors have increased for all the constituents,
and in addition, the normalized residual in the fit is very
large, some nine times larger than the other cases presented
here. These analyses testify to the inadequacy of a two-
parameter model in describing aerosol extinction. In rows 7
and 8, the influence of measurement accuracy on retrieval
errors is analyzed. Transmittance errors at all wavelengths
were increased (in row 7) and decreased (in row 8) by a
factor of two relative to those of the base model (which
were taken from a sample SAGE III measurement and are
applied in all cases unless otherwise specified). Such error
changes affect the retrieval errors in the atmospheric con-

of an error introduced into the measurement referencing
height is tested by increasing all tangent heights by 0.5 km.
Such an error leads to a dramatic and potentially serious
increase in the errors associated with solving the inverse
problem.
4. SAGE III Retrievals
[16] In this section we describe retrievals of O3 and NO2
from SAGE III measurements made between May and
October 2002. In the mesosphere, our ozone retrievals are
compared with measurements made by the CRISTA [Kostsov
et al., 2004] and HALOE [Bruhl et al., 1996] (data from
http://haloedata.larc.nasa.gov/) satellite instruments, clima-
tological model profiles, and SAGE III ozone retrievals
obtained via NASA’s operational algorithm. In the strato-
sphere, we compare our retrievals with those of the SAGE III
operational algorithm and with independent measurements
made by ozonesondes, lidar, and HALOE. SAGE III
retrievals yield number density, so this unit is employed in
comparisons with independent measurements wherever
these also employ number density. Where comparison data
are available only in mixing ratio, the SAGE III data are
converted using the meteorological data supplied for each
occultation.
[17] For the period between May and October 2002, for
which we obtained the SAGE III transmission data, we
located independent measurements within 550 km and
24 hours. This search yielded some 52 O3 profiles from
11 ozonesonde stations (WMO World Data Center for
Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation, ftp://ftp.tor.ec.gc.ca),
23 O3 profiles from 5 lidar stations (http://nadir.nilu.no)
and 147 HALOE O3 and NO2 profiles [Bruhl et al., 1996].
Because the SAGE III inversion algorithms do not account
for spatial inhomogeneity resulting from diurnal changes,
we restricted our comparisons with HALOE data to local
sunset only cases. This significantly reduced the number of
coincidences from 147 to 43. In addition, CRISTA measure-
ments [Kostsov et al., 2004] were obtained for validation of
mesospheric ozone. These independent measurements are
listed in Table 2.
4.1. Ozone Retrievals
[18] In the SAGE III spectral range, ozone absorbs in two
diapasons—in the shortwave range between 290 and 330 nm
and in the visible, with a maximum at 600 nm. The UV
absorption band can be used to obtain ozone concentrations
at tangent heights of 100–40 km. Below this, the atmosphere
becomes opaque as a result of molecular scattering and
ozone absorption. The Chappuis band (600 nm) is weaker
and can be used below 50–60 km. As distinct from the
SAGE III operational algorithm, in which the shortwave
range is used for altitudes above 50 km, and the longwave
range, for altitudes below 50 km, in our algorithm all
wavelengths are considered simultaneously—with the
exception of the 290 nm channel which is included only at
altitudes above 55 km.
[19] Figure 1 shows examples of the ozone profiles
retrieved from the SAGE III data using our inversion
scheme and demonstrates the spatial-temporal variability
of O3 profiles from 54S to 79N between May and
October. Fine structure is seen in the profiles, as is a
secondary maximum in the polar profile, and the meso-
spheric minimum at 70–80 km.
[20] In Figure 2 we show a comparison of the mean
retrieved profile obtained from 16 SAGE III events taken in
July 2002 between 43N and 47N using the SPbSU
algorithm, with July models at latitudes of 40N and
50N [Keating et al., 1989]. The models give very close
agreement with our retrievals.
[21] In the mesosphere, we used CRISTA profiles derived
from infrared limb spectra between 4 and 12 November
1994 for comparison with our retrievals. The CRISTA O3
profiles at 50–100 km were derived using a special algo-
rithm which does not assume local thermodynamic equilib-
rium [Kostsov et al., 2004]. Because of the large temporal
differences in the measurements we can compare only mean
profiles and their variances. To make the geometrical
configuration as close as possible, we used only those
CRISTA measurements taken during sunrises and sunsets
at zenith angles of 80–100. These measurements were
made at latitudes of 41N–63N and 16S–53S. The mean

of these profiles was compared with SAGE III data for the

profiles show a minimum in the ozone number density at
80 km, and coincide very closely at 55–65 km. At all
altitudes, the mean profiles overlap within the standard
deviation of the data but there are some differences between
them. Above 65 km, SAGE III gives lower values of O3
number density. Below 65 km, the opposite holds. There is
also a small difference in the altitude of the O3 minimum at
8085 km. Bearing in mind the natural O3 variability and
the large temporal measurement difference (8 years), the
measurements are in reasonable agreement.
[22] HALOE mesospheric ozone measurements were also
compared with SAGE III. As mentioned above, 147 HALOE
profiles collocated in time and space with SAGE III
data were obtained. However, this comparison includes both
sunrise and sunset occultations. Because the SAGE III
algorithms assume horizontal homogeneity and do not
account for the inhomogeneity introduced by diurnal varia-
tions, we chose to compare only those local sunset obser-
vations, which reduces the number of comparisons to 43.
Figure 4 shows a comparison of the mean of these profiles
with the mean O3 profiles retrieved from SAGE III mea-
surements by the two algorithms, SPbSU and the opera-
tional (NASA) algorithm (SAGE III level 2 data). The
horizontal lines show the standard deviation in the HALOE
data. These data agree well in the lower mesosphere where
RMS differences between the SAGE III algorithms and
HALOE are less than 20%. Above 65 km, the differences
increase, reaching as much as 100% in the middle meso-
sphere, but then dropping off slightly at higher altitudes. At
70–80 km there is a minimum in the ozone and although
the difference in the means of the three profiles is quite
small (Figure 4 (left)), the relative RMS deviation between
SPbSU and HALOE shown in Figure 4 (right) reaches a
maximum value of over 100% here. This discrepancy
indicates significant differences between individual profiles
at this altitude. However, the smallness of the absolute value
serves to increase the relative error significantly. At 80–
90 km the RMS relative differences decrease to around 40–
80% as a result of the increase in the absolute value of the
ozone mixing ratio. Comparing SPbSU retrievals with the
SAGE III algorithm, differences are small below 65 km, but
increase significantly in the upper mesosphere above 75 km.
The SPbSU algorithm gives better agreement with HALOE
than the SAGE III operational algorithm at these high
altitudes. Differences arise for a variety of reasons, but
most notably because retrieval errors increase with altitude.
Also, diurnal effects which are treated in the HALOE
algorithm, but not in the SAGE III algorithms are more
important at higher altitudes.
[23] There are more opportunities for comparisons of
SAGE III ozone data in the stratosphere. In addition to
satellites, there are networks of ozonesonde and lidar
stations. These stations are part of the World Ozone and
Ultraviolet Radiation Data Center (WOUDC) and the data
are accessible online (http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/woudc).
Fifty-two ozonesonde profiles were chosen for validation of
our SAGE III retrievals. These measurements provide
ozone partial pressure and the corresponding air pressure
and temperature profiles, which allow for conversion to
ozone number density. An example comparison of a single
SAGE III profile with an ozonesonde measurement is given
in Figure 5. The fine structure in the ozone profile (in
particular, a secondary maximum at 13–14 km, and a step
near 21–23 km) is well resolved. At altitudes above 16 km
the difference in the profiles is less than 10%, but increases
significantly below this altitude because of the smaller
ozone concentration in the lowest part of the stratosphere.

[24] In Figure 6 we show a comparison between a lidar
profile from Hohenpeissenberg and retrievals performed by
the SPbSU and operational (NASA) algorithms from
SAGE III data. The lidar and SAGE data locations are only
18 km and 1 hour apart. The two satellite retrievals agree
closely in magnitude and in fine structure and differ by
±10% from the lidar for most of the stratosphere. The largest
difference with the lidar profile, of 30%, occurs at an altitude
of 17 km. Because of the similarity in the two SAGE III
retrievals this suggests some real differences between the
ozone profiles measured by the two instruments. It is
possible that the averaging of the SAGE III data over the
slant path through the atmosphere and horizontal ozone
variations produce some differences between the ozone
measurements.
[25] In Figure 7, we show the statistical summary of our
comparisons between all the ozonesonde profiles, and the
SAGE III data retrieved via the SPbSU and operational
algorithms. The natural variability of the ozonesonde mea-
surements (standard deviation in profiles), together with the

mean and RMS differences between the SAGE III data and
these measurements are shown. Because of the differences in
time and space between sets of measurements, differences
between the ozone profiles have at least two sources—
natural spatial-temporal variability within the limits of our
collocation criteria, and the difference between the observa-
tion methods. The relative importance of these two factors
changes with altitude.
[26] At 10–35 km, there is an overestimate of the ozone
number density by the SAGE III retrieved profiles in
Figure 6. Comparison of a SAGE III ozone profile (ID 221720, on 21 May 2002 at 1849, location

Hohenpeissenberg. Profiles were measured 18 km and 1 hour apart.

comparison with the ozonesonde data. There is little differ-
ence between the random component (RMS) of the differ-
ence at 25–35 km and the mean difference, which suggests
that most of the difference arises from a real systematic
difference between the profiles in this altitude region. In the
15–35 km altitude range, the natural profile variability is
significantly greater than the RMS difference between the
retrieved and measured profiles. Thus the SAGE III satellite
measurements provide new information on the ozone con-
tent at these altitudes. Below 15 km, the RMS difference
increases and approaches the natural variability of the
ozonesonde measurements, so SAGE III contributes com-
parable accuracy at these low altitudes. The retrievals
obtained via the two different SAGE III algorithms show
very similar statistics in comparison to the ozonesonde data.
[27] Ozone number density profiles obtained from 23
lidar soundings are compared with collocated SAGE III
events in Figure 8. Presented here are the statistics of this set
of comparisons showing the mean and RMS differences
between the lidar data and those obtained for the SPbSU
algorithm and the operational algorithm applied to the same
SAGE III data. Also shown is the standard deviation (RMS
variability) of the lidar data. At 20–40 km, there is a
systematic overestimation of ozone values by both algo-
rithms using SAGE III data in comparison with lidar data,
but the overestimate is only about half of what it was for
ozonesondes. No systematic difference exists between the
satellite and lidar profiles at 15–20 km but below 15 km
the satellite data again exceed the lidar data. In general, the
patterns of mean and RMS difference are very similar for
the two SAGE III retrieval algorithms, but below 15 km the
biases in the two algorithms are opposite from each other.
The altitude dependence of the RMS differences is similar
for lidar and the ozonesondes above 15 km and these
differences are smaller than the natural variability of the
data. At 20–35 km the RMS differences are a factor of 2–
3 smaller than the standard deviation of the data.
[28] It is instructive to see how well the ozonesonde and
lidar data agree with each other. When data from seven
collocated ozonesonde and lidar measurements were com-
pared (Figure 9), no systematic differences were found
between them between 20 and 33 km. In this altitude range,
the RMS difference between profiles was also small—less
than 10%. However, below 15 km both systematic and
RMS differences became much larger, increasing to 60
and 80% respectively at 12 km. This level of agreement
suggests that a real part of differences seen between
measurements at these altitudes in the lowest part of the
stratosphere is a result of natural (spatial and temporal)
ozone variability at these altitudes, and does not occur only
in satellite experiments as a result of the problem of
separating aerosol and ozone contributions to extinction.
Satellite measurements give average values over a horizon-
tal path of 200–400 km depending on the measurement
altitude. Ozonesonde measurements are made in situ with a
vertical resolution of approximately 100 m and can deviate
from their launch location by 100–200 km. Lidar measure-
ments are normally performed looking vertically upward
and thus have very high spatial resolution in the horizontal.
If the ozone field is horizontally homogeneous then the
effect of differences in the exact location and the spatial
resolution for the different methods is very small, and one
would expect the comparisons to be good—as is the case for
the middle and upper stratosphere. However, in the lower
Figure 8. Statistics of the differences between the SAGE III ozone profiles retrieved by the SPbSU
algorithm, the SAGE III operational algorithm, and the lidar measurements.

stratosphere the ozone field is highly variable and often
horizontally inhomogeneous. This variability leads to dif-
ferent ozone values derived from different measurement
methods. This problem causes serious difficulties in vali-
dating satellite measurements in the lower stratosphere
under conditions of horizontal inhomogeneity of the ozone
field. Similar effects would also be expected in the middle
stratosphere if ‘‘ozone holes’’ are present. For a true
validation of the SAGE III ozone measurements in the
lower atmosphere, it is necessary to tighten the collocation
criteria applied, or schedule specific ground truth missions.
[29] SAGE III ozone profiles retrieved using the SPbSU
algorithm have also been compared with HALOE strato-
spheric ozone profiles for SAGE III local sunset events
collocated in time (within 24 hrs.) and space (550 km) with
43 HALOE measurements. HALOE employs solar occulta-
tion in the infrared to infer atmospheric gas and aerosol
loadings. The results of the comparisons are shown in
Figure 10. Mean differences between the two data sets are
less than 10% in the wide range of altitudes between 16 and
45 km, with SPbSU retrievals from the SAGE III measure-
ments giving the larger values. The RMS differences
between 20 and 45 km are less than 20%. Below 20 km,
the differences increase significantly because of the higher
ozone variability and the higher aerosol content which leads
to a smaller signal-to-noise ratio for ozone.
[30] It is instructive to examine the degree to which the
ozone retrievals are influenced by the inversion algorithm.
In Figure 11, we present the mean SAGE III stratospheric
ozone profiles obtained from the SPbSU and NASA algo-
rithms for the complete set of 157 events available between
May and October 2002, the absolute and relative RMS
differences between the retrievals and the mean difference
between them. Between 15 and 50 km the RMS difference is
less than 8% and is only 4–5% between 20 and 40 km. There
is a small (about 2%) systematic difference between them
throughout most of the stratosphere, with the SPbSU algo-
rithm retrieving slightly lower values. At 10–13 km the
RMS difference increases greatly, and, as can be seen in
Figure 11 (left), exceeds 100% at low altitudes. Differences
between the retrievals may be accounted for by the differ-
ence in the ozone absorption coefficients used, and at lower
altitudes the differences are likely attributable to the differ-
ence in the way that aerosols are accounted for in the two
algorithms, because aerosols dominate the extinction at these
low altitudes. In the operational algorithm, the atmospheric
transmittance function is approximated from the optical
depth averaged over the spectral intervals (equations (5)
and (6)) as opposed to the SPbSU method in which
the integration is performed within each spectral interval
(equations (3) and (4)).
4.2. Nitrogen Dioxide
[31] To validate the NO2 retrievals, we compared our
retrievals with those profiles of coincident HALOE local
sunset events using the same set of measurements (43
SAGE III and HALOE occultation events) as we used for
the ozone validation. As in the case of ozone we restricted
our comparisons with HALOE measurements to local
sunset only events to limit differences which might arise
as a result of differing treatment of diurnal effects in the
SAGE III and HALOE algorithms. In Figure 12 we show an
example comparison of a single retrieval. Figure 12 shows
the NO2 profile measured by HALOE and one retrieved

from the same SAGE III transmission data for the opera-
tional SAGE III algorithm and for our (SPbSU) algorithm.
The forms of the three retrievals are similar at all altitudes
but there are large differences between the magnitudes of
the NO2 mixing ratios at most altitudes. Horizontal line
segments in Figure 12 show the estimated errors in our
retrieval. (For clarity, estimated errors from SAGE III and
HALOE are not shown, but errors from HALOE are similar
to those shown, and for SAGE III they are significantly
larger.) The differences between the profiles exceed the
combined estimated errors at many altitudes. The SPbSU
algorithm retrieves lower NO2 concentrations than HALOE
and SAGE III throughout most of the stratosphere. This
result holds for the intercomparisons in general, and is
evident in Figure 13, where we show the mean differences
between HALOE and the SPbSU algorithm for all the
coincident local sunset events. In Figure 13, we have
compared only local sunset events in order to minimize
differences which may be caused by the different (or lack
of) treatment of diurnal effects in the algorithms
[Newchurch et al., 1996]. Note, however, that these diurnal
corrections are unimportant above 25 km and maximize at
only 20% at about 20 km. In the statistics of the NO2
intercomparisons between SPbSU and HALOE shown in
Figure 13 it is clear that the shapes of the mean profiles are
in good general agreement. In the NO2 layer between 25
and 40 km the mean difference is mostly less than 20%,
peaking at around 40% close to 30 km. The RMS differ-
ence between the two is similar but a little larger, 20–35%,
and mimics the variance in the HALOE and SPbSU
retrievals.
[32] Going back to the single event shown in Figure 12,
the SAGE III operational algorithm produces higher con-
centrations than the SPbSU algorithm. This result appears to
be systematic and carries over to the mean of all the profiles
we compared (addressed in Figure 14.) In Figure 14, we
show a comparison of the SAGE III NO2 profiles retrieved
by the SPbSU and by the operational algorithm for the set of
coincident profiles. This comparison suggests a systematic
difference in the retrievals, with the operational algorithm
producing values consistently higher. Mean differences in
NO2 between SAGE III and SPbSU retrievals are 20–30%
throughout the main stratospheric layer (Figure 14 (right)).
RMS differences are close to the mean differences and
exceed them by less than 5%.
[33] The agreement between the NO2 profiles obtained
from HALOE and from SAGE III shows significant sensi-
tivity to the retrieval algorithm employed. This will be
examined in more detail in future investigations that will
include the extension of our algorithm to the treatment of
diurnal effects and thus allow for a closer comparison of the
HALOE and SAGE III data.
5. Summary
[34] A new algorithm has been independently developed
for the retrieval of atmospheric gas concentrations and
aerosol extinction from the SAGE III transmission data.
This new algorithm differs from the NASA operational
algorithm in several key aspects—(1) the algorithm takes
into account the finite altitude and spectral resolution of
measurements by integrating over the width of the viewing
window spatially and spectrally; (2) the inverse problem is
solved nonlinearly using the optimal estimation algorithm;
and (3) the aerosol extinction is parameterized by an
optimal expansion using the eigenvectors of the aerosol
extinction correlation matrix. This matrix was constructed
via numerical simulation for a large database of models of
Figure 12. Comparison of the retrieved NO2 profiles from the SPbSU algorithm, the SAGE III
operational algorithm, and HALOE. The SAGE III data corresponds to event 373510, taken on
9 September 2002, at 55S, 29W. SAGE III and HALOE measurements were 463 km and 17 min apart.

stratospheric and tropospheric aerosol [see Timofeyev et al.,
2003].
[35] In order to assess the potential accuracy of the
retrieval of atmospheric parameters by our algorithm,
closed-loop numerical experiments were performed taking
into account the SAGE III random measurement noise.
These simulations produced errors in retrieving ozone of
5% on average in the altitude range of 12–70 km,
increasing outside this range. The mean errors in retrieving
NO2 concentration were 6–8% at altitudes of 20–45 km.
The optimal number of eigenvectors in the expansion of the
aerosol extinction coefficient was determined to be 4. Errors
in the assignment of tangent height have a strong influence
on the errors in retrieving the atmospheric parameters, and
can increase the error by two to three times for a height error
of 0.5 km.
[36] Extensive comparisons of our retrievals with those
from other satellites, ozonesondes, and lidar were made. In
addition, the results from our algorithm were compared with
those of the SAGE III operational algorithm. Comparison of
ozone profiles with ozonesonde measurements (collocated
in time (within 24 hours) and space (within 550 km))
demonstrated good agreement (better than 10–20%) in the
middle and upper stratosphere. In the lower stratosphere and
upper troposphere, the disagreement was greater and could
be 40% or more. At altitudes of 25–35 km the RMS
differences between the satellite and the ozonesonde mea-
surements were two to three times less than ozone natural
variability. However, in the lower stratosphere and upper
troposphere, the RMS difference was almost as great as the
natural variability.
[37] In most cases, our retrieved ozone data were found to
be in good agreement with the lidar measurements (within
5–20% at altitudes of 17–40 km). Below 17 km, the
differences increased. Satellite measurements recovered
the fine structure in the ozone vertical profiles well. At
altitudes of 15–35 km the RMS satellite-lidar differences
were 1.5 to 3 times the natural ozone variability. At lower
altitudes these values were essentially equal.
[38] Comparisons of retrieved ozone with the HALOE
data demonstrated good agreement. On average, differences
between individual retrievals did not exceed 10–20%.
Typical differences were less than 10%, well within the
sum of the estimated errors in both measurements.
[39] Because ozone concentrations from SAGE III showed
large differences from ozonesonde and lidar measurements
in the lowest part of the stratosphere, it was instructive to
investigate howwell these independent lidar and ozonesonde
measurements agreed with each other. We compared these
using the same collocation criteria (within 550 km and
24 hours) and found that mean and RMS differences were
3–6% at 17–32 km. Below 17 km differences increased up
to 20–60% for the mean and 80% for the RMS. Thus it
appears that large differences in ozone observed below 15–
17 km are not necessarily due to the satellite retrieval but
exist between other sets of measurements also.
[40] SPbSU retrievals of NO2 vertical profiles demon-
strated spatial-temporal variations that are in good agree-
ment with NO2 seasonal and latitudinal models. Comparison
of SPbSU NO2 retrievals with HALOE measurements
showed good agreement in general, but in a number of cases
the differences are considerable. Mean differences between
the two satellite measurements were 520% and RMS
differences, less than 20% above 18 km. In the lower
stratosphere, mean and RMS differences increased up to
30% and 45%, respectively. SAGE III NO2 retrievals using
the operational algorithm differ systematically from those
using the SPbSU algorithm (see Figure 14) with mean and
RMS differences of 2040%.
Appendix A: Convergence in the Solution of the
Optimal Estimation Problem
[41] The solution of the inverse problem through optimal
estimation, generalized to nonlinear problems, is that of
finding x^ to minimize the function F(x^),
F x^ð Þ ¼ B x^ð Þ  yk k2S1y þ x^ xak k

S1a
; ðA1Þ
where B is the forward operator acting on parameters, x^, and
y is the set of measurements. To avoid problems in
achieving convergence (due to the nonlinearity), we used
the minimization of F1(xk+1) [Polyakov, 1996],
F1 xkþ1ð Þ ¼ B xkþ1ð Þ  yk k2S1y þ xkþ1  xak k

Here xk and xk+1 are consecutive approximations to the
solution. L is any positive determined matrix. The notation,
~J
 
C1 , in equations (A1) and (A2) above denotes the scalar
product (~J , C1~J ). When the iterative process converges,
the last term in (A2) is equal to zero and the solution of (A2)
coincides with that of (A1).
[42] To choose the matrix L, we used the following
algorithm. Matrix L is represented as the product L = l 
L0, where l is a positive number and L0 is the diagonal
matrix with the diagonal set equal to the diagonal of the a
priori uncertainty matrix, Sa. The number l is chosen at each
step of the iteration process so that the condition F(x^k+1) 
F(x^k) is accomplished. If this condition is not accomplished,
l is halved and ~xk+1 is calculated afresh. This procedure is
repeated until the condition is met. To accelerate this
process, the parameter l is doubled if its value does not
decrease in the two previous steps. In this manner we
achieve the optimal change in the solution at each step
corresponding to the nonlinear problem.
