Abstract. The influence of soil pH was evaluated on the abundance and generic diversity of 
cyanobacteria in soil samples collected from diverse rice soil ecologies of India. Qualitative and 
quantitative studies of the 52 soil samples collected from nine agroecologies was carried out using 
enrichment, MPN (Most Probable Number) techniques and diversity indices were measured. A total of 
166 forms, including 130 heterocystous and 36 non-heterocystous isolates were isolated and the highest 
percentage of abundance of heterocystous forms was observed at pH of 8.1. Highest Shannon’s diversity 
index was recorded at a pH of 6.9, followed by pH of 7.4, while indices of richness and evenness (J and 
E) were highest in soil samples of pH of 9.3. This study highlighted the successful colonization of 
cyanobacteria in rice field soils of diverse pH and the need for enrichment of the native flora as a means 
of exploiting the full potential of cyanobacterial biofertilizers in agriculture

Introduction  
Cyanobacteria represent cosmopolitan prokaryotes, which can be found in almost 
every conceivable habitat, including soil, on rocks, in fresh water, and in salt water 
[6,11]. In aquatic environments, cyanobacteria often form thick microbial mats, serving 
as crucial components in such ecosystems, as they are the primary producers at the base 
of the microbial food web. Cyanobacteria also increase the oxygen concentration and 
improve other physico-chemical parameters of the environment, in which they grow and 
flourish [13]. They are also found in the deserts, where they remain dormant for most of 
the time, taking advantage of the occasional rains, although this is not the most common 
[7]. Because they secrete polysaccharides that bind soil, cyanobacteria help to control 
stability, erosion, runoff, and site availability for germination by higher plants. In 
nature, cyanobacteria are abundant in places where there is a major nitrogen-deficiency. 
Among soil properties, pH is a very important factor in growth, establishment and 
diversity of cyanobacteria, which have generally been reported to prefer neutral to 
slightly alkaline pH for optimum growth [23,10]. Acidic soils are therefore one of the 
stressed environments for these organisms and they are normally absent at pH values 
below 4 or 5; eukaryotic algae, however, flourish under these conditions. Soil pH is also 
known to have a selective effect on the indigenous algal flora, especially cyanobacteria 
and their succession and abundance in soil. Species of Nostoc, Anabaena, Tolypothrix, 
Aulosira, Cylindrospermum, Scytonema, Westiellopsis and several other genera are 
widespread in Indian rice field soils and are known to contribute significantly to their 
fertility [29,9’15]. There are very few reports on the existence of cyanobacteria at low 
pH (acidic range) as they are in general, intolerant to low pH conditions [1,8,5]

Among the diverse habitats, rice fields constitute one of the favourable ecologies for 
the growth and proliferation of cyanobacteria [30,26,14]. In the 1970s, algalization or 
the enrichment of soil via inoculation of selected cyanobacterial strains led to the 
promotion of these biofertilisers among the farming community in South East Asia 
[26,28]. However, in recent years, an urgent need has felt to address inherent 
deficiencies, which have limited their extensive exploitation in diverse rice ecologies 
and soil types.  In a country such as India, rice is grown under diverse ecologies with  
Therefore, this investigation was aimed at quantification of the cyanobacterial 
diversity – in terms of population counts, relative generic abundance, and their 
correlation with pH of the various soil samples collected and isolation of dominant 
genera from diverse rice ecologies of India. 
Materials and methods 
Collection of soil samples and isolation and enumeration of cyanobacteria  
Soil samples collected from diverse agroecological regions and soil types (Fig. 1 and 
Table 1) were measured for their EC and pH range and utilized for enrichment studies 
in BG –11 medium with/ without nitrogen supplementation. Enumeration of populations 
was carried out by MPN (Most Probable Number) technique and tabulated for each site 
under the various locations. The enrichment flasks and MPN tubes were regularly 
monitored for growth and observed microscopically. Standard plating / streaking 
techniques were used for isolation and purification of cyanobacterial strains [24].  
 
Identification and purification of cyanobacteria 
The growth pattern and morphological examination of the cyanobacterial strains was 
carried out at different stages of growth in nitrogen-free liquid and solid (agar) BG-11 
medium. The strains were viewed under a Nikon (Microphot-FX) microscope and the 
nature of filaments and the shape and size of vegetative cells, heterocysts and akinetes, 
were analysed and assigned to different genera , using the keys of Desikachary [4]. 
Measurement of soil EC and pH 
The soil samples (soil : water = 1: 2.5) were analysed with respect to their EC 
(Electrical Conductivity) and pH range following the methodology outlined by Black 
[2].  
 
Measurement of acetylene reducing activity 
Gas chromatographic quantification of ethylene formed (acetylene reduction activity, 
ARA) was utilized as an index of nitrogen fixation. The vials with log phase cultures 
(14d) were injected with acetylene (10% gas phase) after removing an equal amount of 
air, using airtight syringes and incubated for 90 minutes under optimal conditions of 
temperature and illumination [18]. The samples (1 ml) were injected into a Gas 
Chromatograph (Chemito, model GC 1000), fitted with an oven containing a 2m long 
column of stainless steel (2mm internal diameter) packed with Poropak N (80-100 
mesh). Nitrogen gas flowing at the rate of 35ml min-1 was used as the carrier, while 
hydrogen and air were used to produce the flame in the Flame Ionisation Detector. The 
oven, injector and detector were maintained at 100-120°C to allow for ionization and 
detection of ethylene produced.

Commercially available standard ethylene was utilized for quantification and vials 
with an equivalent volume of water served as controls [18]. The ARA values were 
expressed per mg chlorophyll. Spectrophotometric estimation of the chlorophyll content 
of cells was carried out following the method of Mackinney [12]. All values presented 
are means of triplicate measurements. 
 
Statistical analyses 
The diversity indices (Shannon’s diversity index and Simpson’s index of diversity) 
were calculated using the standard formulae. 
Correlation coefficients were calculated using Microsoft Excel package and analysed 
for their significance using Pearson’s tables 
Results and discussion 
The trophic independence from carbon and nitrogen, together with a great 
adaptability to environmental variations, enables cyanobacteria to be ubiquitous. Their 
structural-functional flexibility provides them with not only great versatility, but also 
makes them among the most successful in extreme environments including high 
temperatures, high levels of UV light, and high salinity and inhabit a wide range of 
environments and niches. Their role in the soil ecosystem is manifold, the most 
important consequences being the fixation of nitrogen and carbon, besides promoting 
release of nutrients and reducing the rate of loss of water and soil through erosion. In 
paddy fields, their relative occurrence varies within large limits, ranging from 0 to 76-
85%. However, contrary to the general belief, nitrogen fixing forms are not invariably 
present in tropical rice soils. All India survey showed that out of 2,213 soil samples 
from rice fields, only about 33% harboured nitrogen-fixing forms [27], and limited 
systematic analyses on their limited distribution has been undertaken in relation to 
major environmental factors [19,21,22]. 
Among the soil properties, pH is certainly the most important factor determining the 
flora and fauna composition. In culture media, the optimal pH for the growth of 
cyanobacteria ranges from 7.5 – 10, with a lower limit of 6.5 – 7.0. However, in soil-
culture experiments, soils having slightly alkaline reaction were more favourable, while 
in natural environments cyanobacteria prefer neutral to alkaline pH [3,20]. The 
development of soil acidity is generally believed to be associated with the base 
unsaturation caused by leaching out of bases and genesis from base-poor acidic rocks. 
The dissolved or free acidic substances, such as sulphuric acid and ferric and aluminium 
sulphate, accentuate acidity in acid sulphate soils [5]. 
In the present investigation, soil samples were collected from nine locations (Fig.1), 
differing in their EC and pH values and evaluated for cyanobacterial abundance and 
generic diversity. A total of 166 forms, including 130 heterocystous and 36 
heterocystous isolates were recorded. A predominance of heterocystous forms (68 – 
95%) was observed at all locations, while non-heterocystous forms exhibited 5-32% 
abundance in the various locations (Table 1). Highest % abundance of heterocystous 
forms was observed at pH of 8.1, followed by 7.9 (83 and 80% respectively). In terms 
of non-heterocystous forms, soil samples with pH of 7.4 and 9.3 recorded highest % 
abundance.

Simpson’s Reciprocal indices (Fig.1) were highest in Jeypore soil samples, followed 
by those from Aduthurai. Shannon’s diversity index was highest at a pH of 6.9, 
followed by pH of 7.4, indicative of the higher number of genera recorded in these soil 
samples. Indices of richness and evenness (J and E) were highest in soil samples of pH 
of 9.3 (Table 2). Shannon’s indices are strongly biased towards richness, as it is 
calculated from proportional abundances of the species. On the other hand, Simpson’s 
index is a measure of diversity, which takes into account both richness and evenness, 
although it gives more weight to the more abundant species in a sample.

In general, Nostoc and Anabaena recorded maximum number of isolates i.e. 10 at pH 
of 6.5. The number of isolates belonging to the genera Anabaena and Nostoc also 
showed the highest relative abundance of 100%, while lowest values were recorded for 
Aulosira and Lyngbya, as they were isolated only from one of the 9 locations. The 
relative abundance of cyanobacteria in rice soils and biofertilizer inocula from four 
countries revealed that significant correlation could be made with respect to pH and 
available P content of soils [21]. Algalization, when effective, is generally associated 
with increase in yield but the success of algalization is dependent on a number of factors 
that include flooding due to rains, simultaneous use of inorganic fertilizers, animal 
manures, pesticides and amount of light available to the cyanobacteria as the plant 
grows. 
Earlier studies on the distribution pattern of cyanobacteria in soils of Andhra 
Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab revealed that although 
recurrent combination of forms were discernable, there appeared to be a localized 
distribution of cyanobacteria depending upon the soil pH, electrical conductivity and 
exchangeable sodium. Species of Nostoc, Calothrix, Scytonema, Hapalosiphon and 
Wetiellopsis were recorded in salt-affected soils of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh 
(where pH of the soil varied from 6.0 to 9.0), although the species of Nostoc and 
Calothrix were predominant. On analyzing the total cyanobacterial flora, it was 
observed that out of the total 37 species, 50 percent were nitrogen- fixing strains, 
including the non-heterocystous nitrogen fixers. Unicellular and colonial forms, with 
extensive mucilage like Aphanocapsa, Aphanothece, Chroococcus, Gloeocapsa and 
Gloeothece and filamentous species of Scytonema, Lyngbya and Tolypothri were also 
very common in Maharashtara soils. A significant reduction in soil salinity (12-35%) 
due to repeated cultivation of Anabaena torulosa in soils rendered saline owing to bad 
farm management has also been reported Cyanobacteria have been found not only to 
grow in highly saline-alkali soils, but also improve the physico-chemical properties of 
the soil by enriching them with carbon, nitrogen and available phosphorus [9,10].

years it may help to produce a reasonably good yield of crops, as observed by Singh 
[23] for sugarcane after 3 years of reclamation with BGA. Although infrequent at pH 
below 6.0, their ability to grow in diverse pH ranges and modify their environment 
makes them successful in any niche. Acidic soils, in general do not support their 
growth, although a few reports on their presence in soils with pH values between 5 and 
6 are available [1,16,17].   
Correlation between the number of isolates from each of the dominant genera and pH 
of the location sampled also showed a positive correlation for Calothrix, Phormidium 
and Hapalosiphon (Fig. 6). The numbers of isolates belonging to the genera Nostoc and 
Anabaena, however, exhibited a negative correlation, indicating that although these two 
genera show highest relative abundance quantitatively, their relative tolerance to pH is 
low. Nostoc and Anabaena, therefore, exhibited superior establishing and adaptive 
traits, although in terms of numbers, they showed an uneven distribution at different pH. 
However, the correlation was not statistically significant in any of these cases. Among 
the non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, Phormidium was the most cosmopolitan –20 
isolates as against 9 and 5 belonging to Oscillatoria/Lyngbya. A similar trend was 
observed on correlating EC values and number of isolates belonging to the dominant 
genera (data not shown). Species of Calothrix and Aulosira have been reported to be 
ubiquitous in rice fields of Kerala where pH ranges from 3.5 – 6.5 [1]. Also, the number 
of spore producers is known to show a positive correlation with soil pH. Enrichment of 
such soils with the indigenous cyanobacterial isolates may help in ameliorating the land 
and making them suitable for obtaining higher yields as benefits, other than nitrogen 
fixation, include solubilisation of phosphorus, improved soil structure and synthesis of 
growth promoting substances are also known.

Anabaena (Fig.7). Highest values were recorded in the isolates from Assam (A43 and 
44), followed by the isolate from saline-alkali soil samples from Lucknow (A15).  
The effect of pH on algal flora is generally difficult to evaluate as it is often 
correlated with other factors, for e.g. arid soils are almost universally alkaline and many 
continuously wet soils acidic. Among correlations between the relative abundance of 
the individual groups of heterocystous cyanobacteria and soil physico-chemical 
properties, only the correlation between pH and the relative abundance of Nostoc was 
found to be statistically significant, but a degree of bias was introduced when dry and 
wet samples were tested separately [21]. Contradictory reports regarding the occurrence 
in acid and very acid environments are available. However, one of the most acid lakes 
(pH 2.9) was observed to be inhabited by Oscillatoria/Limnothrix and Spirulina [25]. 
Despite the preference for neutral-highly alkaline environments, acidic soils do exhibit 
low diversity and abundance of cyanobacteria [11].

Therefore, efforts need to be focused towards enrichment of indigenous 
cyanobacterial populations, which are better adapted to the specific niche, through 
development of multiple inocula preparations on a regional basis. Research programs 
should be oriented towards agricultural practices, including application of biofertilizers, 
which enhance the growth and proliferation of indigenous strains.
