SUMMARY
Formation of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) tails at
a double-strand break (DSB) is a key step in homolo-
gous recombination andDNA-damage signaling. The
enzyme(s) producing ssDNA at DSBs in eukaryotes
remain unknown. We monitored 50-strand resection
at inducible DSB ends in yeast and identified proteins
required for two stages of resection: initiation and
long-range 50-strand resection. We show that the
Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex (MRX) initiates 50 degra-
dation, whereas Sgs1 and Dna2 degrade 50 strands
exposing long 30 strands. Deletion of SGS1 or DNA2
reduces resection and DSB repair by single-strand
annealing between distant repeats while the remain-
ing long-range resection activity depends on the
exonuclease Exo1. In exo1D sgs1D double mutants,
the MRX complex together with Sae2 nuclease gen-
erate, in a stepwise manner, only few hundred nucle-
otides of ssDNA at the break, resulting in inefficient
gene conversion and G2/M damage checkpoint ar-
rest. These results provide important insights into the
early steps of DSB repair in eukaryotes.
INTRODUCTION
In mitotic cells DNA recombination repairs double-strand breaks
(DSBs) and gaps that occur spontaneously or are induced by
chemicals or irradiation. DSBs occur also as intermediates of
biological events such as meiotic recombination, V(D)J recombi-
nation, or mating-type switching in yeast. DSB-induced homolo-
gous recombination (HR) is initiated by formation of 30-OH sin-
gle-stranded tails (Sun et al., 1991; White and Haber, 1990).
The strand exchange protein Rad51 assembles a nucleofilament
at 30 ssDNA tails that carries out a search for homologous se-
quences and promotes strand invasion (reviewed in San Filippo
et al., 2008; Symington, 2002). The same 30 ssDNA tails at DSB
ends constitute a signal for DNA-damage checkpoint induction
(Vaze et al., 2002; Zou and Elledge, 2003). Mec1/Ddc2 in yeast
and ATR/ATRIP in mammals bind RPA-coated ssDNA tails and
initiate a kinase cascade that leads to cell-cycle arrest (reviewed
in Harrison and Haber, 2006). Formation of 30 ssDNA tails also
determines the switch from the nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ) to the HR pathway because NHEJ preferentially utilizes
the unresected ends for ligation (Ira et al., 2004).
In Escherichia coli, RecBCD, a complex of helicases and a
nuclease, is responsible for the formation of 30 ssDNA tails at
DSBs (reviewed in Spies and Kowalczykowski, 2005). In eukary-
otic cells, however, the major 50 end resection activity remains
unknown. Several proteins that are required for a normal rate
of DSB end resection have been identified in budding yeast
and mammals including the MRX/MRN complex (Mre11-
Rad50-Xrs2 in yeast and Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in human) (Ivanov
et al., 1994; Jazayeri et al., 2006), Sae2/CtIP (Clerici et al., 2005;
Sartori et al., 2007), Exo1 (Llorente and Symington, 2004; Tsu-
bouchi and Ogawa, 2000), and the chromatin remodeling Ino80
or RSC complex (Shim et al., 2007; van Attikum et al., 2004).
Both MRX and Sae2 belong to one epistasis group with respect
to DSB resection (Clerici et al., 2005). Although deletion of any
component of the MRX or Sae2 complex decreases the resec-
tion rate at DSBs, how MRX or Sae2 contributes to resection is
unknown. Mre11 has multiple nuclease motifs but expression of
mre11-H125N, which completely eliminates nuclease activity
in vitro, was shown to retain a nearly normal resection rate, sug-
gesting that the MRX complex may facilitate the access to DSB
ends for other nucleases (Lee et al., 2002; Llorente and Syming-
ton, 2004). Also, the in vitro exonuclease activity of Mre11 has
30 to 50 polarity, which is opposite to the polarity of end degra-
dation observed at DSBs in vivo (Furuse et al., 1998; Paull and
Gellert, 1998; Trujillo et al., 1998). Mre11 nuclease activity is
directly responsible for processing Spo11-induced DSBs only
in meiotic cells, most likely by removing covalently bound
Spo11 from DSB ends (Furuse et al., 1998; Moreau et al.,
1999; Neale et al., 2005; Tsubouchi and Ogawa, 1998; Usui
et al., 1998). Sae2 also exhibits nuclease activity (Lengsfeld
et al., 2007). However, the role of this nuclease in DSB end re-
section is not yet defined. In mammals, loss of either the MRN
complex or the recently identified Sae2 ortholog CtIP results
in a dramatic defect in processing mitotic DSBs (Jazayeri et al.,
2006; Sartori et al., 2007), with checkpoint and recombination

proteins not properly loaded at the g-irradiation-induced dam-
age sites.
Loss of Exo1, a 50 to 30 exonuclease, moderately reduces the
rate of resection, but the more dramatic defect is observed only
when both EXO1 and either theMRX complex orSAE2 are simul-
taneously deleted (Clerici et al., 2005; Llorente and Symington,
2004; Tsubouchi and Ogawa, 2000). Importantly, gene conver-
sion is still accomplished in exo1D mre11D cells, suggesting
that additional enzymes are able to generate ssDNA at DNA
breaks.
Since none of the factors listed above is likely to be the primary
nuclease responsible for resection of DSBs in budding yeast, we
searched for an enzyme that provides a robust resection activity
analogous to the bacterial RecBCD. Bymonitoring the kinetics of
50 resection at regions immediately adjacent to, and at different
distances from the break site, we identified mutants that are
defective in the initiation or progression of 50 strand resection.
We demonstrate that the MRX complex and Sae2 are important
only in the initiation of resection. We also identified two new
factors involved in 50 strand resection: Bloom and Werner syn-
dromes’ helicase ortholog called Sgs1 and the Dna2 nuclease/
helicase. In the absence of Sgs1 or Dna2, resection is slow
and depends on yet another nuclease: Exo1.
RESULTS
DSB Resection Rate in Asynchronous Wild-Type Cells
To define the roles of various factors in 50 strand removal at DSBs
in budding yeast, we first analyzed in detail how breaks are
processed in wild-type cells. We used a strain that has a single
HO endonuclease recognition site at theMAT locus on chromo-
some III. A DSB at MAT cannot be repaired by HR because the
donor sequences HMR and HML are deleted. Following syn-
chronous HO-induced cleavage, wemonitored the rate of resec-
tion within 80 kb at each side of the break using a set of probes
specific for sequences at different distances from the HO break
(Figure 1A). As the 50 strand is being degraded at DSB ends, the
EcoRI enzyme is unable to cleave ssDNA, and the intensity of the
bands corresponding to the DNA fragments by Southern blot hy-
bridization becomes diminished (Figure 1B). We measured the
band intensity corresponding to each probe over time and an av-
erage rate of resection was estimated from the time at which the
signal intensity dropped to 50% of its original value measured
1 hr after break induction. An average rate of resection in wild-
type cells for all of the investigated EcoRI fragments is 4.4 kb/hr
(Figures 1C and 1D). A similar rate of resection was established
previously in different assays (Fishman-Lobell and Haber, 1992;
Vaze et al., 2002). Interestingly, resection at 30 kb proximal to the
break is blocked. This is due to the presence of long inverted Ty1
transposon repeats that once resected immediately anneal to
each other either within the same sister chromatid or between
two different chromatids, forming a hairpin structure or a dicen-
tric chromosome that blocks further processing. Deletion of Ty
repeats restores resection beyond 30 kb (VanHulle et al., 2007;
G.I. and J.E. Haber, unpublished data). To avoid any impact of
inverted repeats on resection in this study, we used probes lo-
cated prior to the inverted Ty repeats only.
DSB Resection Rate and Efficiency in sgs1D
Cells Is Markedly Reduced
In E. coli, the nuclease component of the RecBCD complex de-
grades ssDNA unwound by helicases and initiates DSB-induced
recombination. To test whether any yeast helicase is involved in
50 strand resection we surveyed the role of Srs2, Sgs1, Rrm3,
and Mph1 DNA helicases in end resection. In this initial screen
only two probes were used, one located immediately next to
the break (MAT) to monitor the rate of initiation of resection,
and the other located 28 kb away from the break (FEN2) that al-
lowed us to follow the rate of long-range resection. In all but one
mutant, the rates of resection were identical to those in wild-
type cells (data not shown). In an sgs1D mutant, initiation of re-
section atMAT was the same as in wild-type cells. However, re-
section at FEN2 was very slow. We used additional probes to
detect resection beyond 3 kb, 10 kb, and 27–28 kb on both
sides of the break. For all probes the average rate of resection
was markedly reduced by about four-fold to about 1 kb/hr
(Figures 2A and 2B). Moreover the efficiency of resection was
also dramatically reduced as only about 40% of cells processed
the 50 strand beyond 28 kb. Sgs1 forms a complex with Top3
and Rmi1 (hereafter called the STR complex) and acts together
in several distinct DNA transactions (Chang et al., 2005; Chen
and Brill, 2007; Fricke et al., 2001; Gangloff et al., 1994; Mullen
et al., 2005). A similar complex was described between human
orthologs called BLM/TopoIIIa/BLAP75 or BTB complex (Ray-
nard et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2000; Yin et al., 2005). We therefore
tested whether TOP3- and RMI1-deficient cells show defects in
50 strand resection comparable to that in the sgs1D mutant.
Both top3D and sgs1D top3D can initiate resection but are
equally defective in long-range resection at 50 strands
(Figure S1 available online). Also the rmi1D mutant is defective
in resection (data not shown). We conclude that the STR com-
plex is required for a wild-type rate (4.4 kb/hr) but not for the
initiation of resection.
Single-Strand Annealing between Distant Repeats
Is Defective in sgs1D Cells
To rule out the possibility that the observed resection defect in
sgs1D is specific for a particular locus or assay that we em-
ployed, we tested whether sgs1D cells are proficient in sin-
gle-strand annealing (SSA) between partial leu2 gene repeats
located 25 kb apart from each other on the left arm of the
chromosome III. In this assay, the HO recognition site is lo-
cated next to the leu2 gene and the second leu2 sequence
is inserted 25 kb downstream at the HIS4 locus. Therefore
25 kb of resection is required for SSA to occur (Figure 3A;
Vaze et al., 2002). To exclude the contribution of break-in-
duced replication (BIR) to DSB repair by which one repeat in-
vades the other repeat and copies the distal part of the chro-
mosome, we measured the repair frequency in the absence of
RAD51. Rad51 is essential for BIR but dispensable for SSA
(Davis and Symington, 2004; VanHulle et al., 2007). We rea-
soned that if Sgs1 is involved in resection, especially for re-
gions further from the break, SSA between repeats separated
by 25 kb should depend strongly on Sgs1. Indeed in rad51D
sgs1D mutant cells SSA is dramatically reduced and product

formation is delayed substantially (Figures 3B–3D). The time
required for product formation is congruent with earlier esti-
mates of a 1 kb/hr rate of resection in an sgs1D mutant (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B). Together these results confirm that sgs1D
cells are defective in 50 strand resection but not in the initial
processing of the breaks.
The Helicase Domain of Sgs1 Is Required
for Proper DSB End Resection
To determine whether the helicase activity of Sgs1 is required for
50 resection, we expressed the wild-type SGS1 gene or sgs1
mutant derivatives with a deletion or single amino acid substitu-
tion in the helicase domain (sgs1-DC795 or sgs1-hd) in sgs1D

cells. As shown in Figure 2C, only wild-type SGS1 was able to
restore the normal resection rate, demonstrating that Sgs1 heli-
case activity is required for efficient removal of the 50 strand.
The MRX Complex Functions Only
in the Initiation of Resection
Sgs1 is a DNA helicase that unwinds a 50 strand and provides
a substrate for a nuclease(s). Previously the MRX complex and
Exo1 were shown to be involved in 50 strand resection. Therefore
we decided to test whether any of these factors is important for
long-range processing of DSB ends along with Sgs1. We mea-
sured resection rates in a rad50Dmutant. Consistent with previ-
ous reports (Ivanov et al., 1994), resection at the MAT locus is
slower in a rad50D mutant (Figure 4A). If the MRX complex is
required for 50 strand processing further away from the break,
we anticipated very slow 50 strand degradation at a distance of
28 kb from the break. However, we did not observe a significant
difference between rad50D and wild-type cells in resection at
28kb, except that a fraction of rad50D cells (about 20%) never ini-
tiated resection and therefore failed to process the 50 strandaway
from the break (Figure 4A). The same results were observed in
mre11D cells (Figure S2). We conclude that cells deficient in

theMRX complex are impaired in the initiation of 50 resection, but
those that successfully initiate resection still process the 50 strand
at the wild-type rate. Therefore, MRX is not the nuclease that
processes 50 strands unwound by Sgs1.
Sgs1 and Exo1 Can Act Independently
to Remove the 50 Strand
To determine whether Exo1 is the enzyme that processes the
50 strands unwound by Sgs1, we measured the resection rate
in an exo1D mutant. Initiation of resection in exo1D cells is
comparable to that in wild-type cells. The kinetics and effi-
ciency of SSA between repeats that are separated by 25 kb
were identical in rad51D and exo1D rad51D cells (Figures 3C
and 3D). In addition resection measured at 28 kb from the
DSB in exo1D cells was reduced, however less dramatically
than in sgs1D cells (Figure 4B). These results indicate that
Exo1 is not the major nuclease that processes 50 strands or
that there is another equally efficient nuclease. We further

constructed the sgs1D exo1D strain and measured the 50
strand resection rate. As shown in Figure 4C, the processing
of DSB ends in sgs1D exo1D is substantially slower and
much less efficient than that in each single mutant. Only about
5%–10% of cells resect the 50 strand beyond the EcoRI site lo-
cated 3 kb away from the break (BUD5 probe). The results
demonstrate that deletion of SGS1 and EXO1 almost com-
pletely eliminates 50 strand degradation. However, these fac-
tors are dispensable for the initial resection of the break. Fur-
thermore, sgs1D exo1D rad51D cells almost never complete
SSA between repeats that are 25 kb or even 5 kb apart (Figures
3C and 3E). Along with the synergistic effect of sgs1D exo1D
on phleomycin-induced damage tolerance (Figure 4D), we con-
clude that Sgs1 and Exo1 play a redundant role in DSB repair:
50 end resection. We also conclude that besides Exo1, another
nuclease exists to process the 50 strand together with the Sgs1
helicase.
Resection in sgs1D exo1D Is Limited to the Vicinity of
DSB Ends and Depends on the MRX Complex and Sae2
The sgs1D exo1Dmutant still sustains slow and limited 50 resec-
tion at the vicinity of the break, as the HO-cut fragments disap-
peared into diffused bands (Figure 4C). To analyze these diffuse
bands in more detail, we separated EcoRI fragments for a longer
time (Figure 5A). Interestingly we observed that several bands
accumulated over time below the initial HO cut bands that mi-
grate in increments of about 100 bp. The additional bands are
observed on both sides of the break. These smaller DNA frag-
ments observed in the sgs1D exo1D double mutant could result
when either 30 end degradation or 50 strand resection pauses at

discrete sites. To distinguish between these two possibilities we
used a 100 bp probe specific to the first 100 bp immediately ad-
jacent to the break (probe B) (Figure 5A). The pattern and relative
intensity of DNA fragments detected by this probe are identical
to DNA fragments detected with a probe specific to 400 bp at
the other end of the HO-cut fragment (probe A). We conclude
that 30 ends are stable and that enzymatic processing of DSB
ends in the absence of both SGS1 and EXO1 pauses at discrete
sites. We further measured how much ssDNA is created over
time on one side of a DSB in the sgs1D exo1D mutant. The first
100 nucleotides are removed quickly, but 4–6 hr after HO induc-
tion only 30% or 10% of cells processed DSB ends beyond 100
or 200 nucleotides, respectively (Figure 5B). Such limited resec-
tion with the unique 100 bp pausing is also detected in rmi1D
exo1D and top3D exo1D strains (Figure S3).
We discovered that STR- and Exo1-independent 50 resection
depends almost entirely on the MRX complex and Sae2. In
sgs1D rad50D, exo1D rad50D, exo1D sgs1D rad50D, and
exo1D sgs1D sae2Dmutants the bands corresponding to smaller
HO cleavage products are never formed and in very slow grow-
ing triple mutants resection of the HO break is almost undetect-
able (Figures 5A and S4). The results indicate that the MRX com-
plex and Sae2 are primarily responsible for resecting close to the
break (Figure 4A). Furthermore, resection close to the break in

rad50D sgs1D and rad50D exo1D double mutant cells is even
more delayed than in a rad50D single mutant, suggesting that
in the absence of the MRX complex both Sgs1 and Exo1 can still
initiate limited DSB end processing.
Mutants with Impaired 50 Strand Resection Show
Decreased Gene Conversion Efficiency
To test whether resection limited to the vicinity of DSB ends in
sgs1D exo1D is sufficient for gene conversion, we used an ec-
topic recombination assay between a MATa sequence located
on chromosome V and a MATa-inc sequence located on chro-
mosome III (Ira et al., 2003). Gene conversion in the sgs1D
exo1D double mutant was reduced by about one-third when
compared to each single mutant, demonstrating that limited
resection in sgs1D exo1D partially impairs DSB repair via gene
conversion (Figure S4). A relatively high level of repair in sgs1D
exo1D cells is not surprising given that 100–200 bp of homology
is sufficient for HR (Ira and Haber, 2002; Jinks-Robertson et al.,
1993) and the resection generates up to 1 kb of ssDNA on each
side of the break. Similarly, gene conversion is decreased in the
rad50D sgs1D and rad50D exo1D double mutants that show de-
creased initiation of resection (Figure S4). Gene conversion is
completely abolished in exo1D sgs1D rad50D cells where almost
no resection is observed (Figure S4).
G2/M Checkpoint Arrest in Response to a Single DSB
Is Impaired in sgs1D exo1D Cells
To examine whether the length of ssDNA in the sgs1D exo1Dmu-
tant is sufficient to trigger theG2/MDNAdamage checkpoint, we
compared the cell-cycle progression after inducing a single un-
repairable DSB in wild-type, exo1D, sgs1D, and sgs1D exo1D
cells. Cell-cycle arrest was monitored microscopically for 12 hr
in micromanipulated unbudded G1 cells on YEP-galactose
plates as described previously (Lee et al., 1998). Ninety percent
of cells from the wild-type and each single mutant strain were ar-
rested within 4 to 6 hr at G2/M and remained arrested for at least
12 hr. In contrast sgs1D exo1D double mutant cells did not arrest
efficiently at G2/M (Figure 5C). This result suggests that limited
resection in the sgs1D exo1D double mutant impairs the G2/M
DNA damage checkpoint. To confirm this result we verified the
localization of the upstream checkpoint protein Ddc2::GFP to
the DSB using fluorescence microscopy. Ddc2/Mec1 is required
for DNA-damage checkpoint arrest (reviewed in Harrison and
Haber, 2006), binds to RPA-coated ssDNA, and was shown pre-
viously to localize to DNA-damage foci (Melo et al., 2001). Fig-
ure 5D shows that Ddc2 foci appear in most of the wild-type
and sgs1D or exo1D singlemutant cells within 4 hr after HO break
induction. In sgs1D exo1D double mutant cells, however, we do
not observe Ddc2 foci for 4 hr after break induction where
only about 100 bp of ssDNA was accumulated. Later, 8 hr after
break induction, about 20% of sgs1D exo1D cells have Ddc2
foci. This result suggests that the slow formation of ssDNA in
the absence of Sgs1 and Exo1 delays DNA-damage checkpoint
activation.
A dna2D Mutant Is Severely Defective in Resection
Our results suggest that besides Exo1 yet another nuclease pro-
cesses 50 strands. Recently in a screen for proteins recruited to
DSBs we discovered Dna2 (W.-H.C. and G.I., unpublished data).
Dna2 is a nuclease/helicase conserved among all eukaryotes
and has been implicated in Okazaki fragment processing (Bae
et al., 2001; Budd and Campbell, 1995). Several hypomorphic
dna2 mutants were shown to be sensitive to DNA damage in-
duced by MMS and g-irradiation (Budd and Campbell, 2000;
Formosa and Nittis, 1999). However the specific function of
Dna2 in DNA repair has not been previously identified. Although
DNA2 is an essential gene, deletion of another helicase, PIF1,
suppresses the lethality of dna2D (Budd et al., 2006). Saccharo-
myces PIF1 encodes two isoforms of a protein transcribed from
different initiating methionine codons (Schulz and Zakian, 1994;
Zhou et al., 2000) to either catalyze telomere length regulation or
promote mitochondrial DNA integrity. In particular, a pif1-m2
mutation allows cells to produce pif1-m2 protein that retains
onlymitochondrial localization (Schulz and Zakian, 1994). Impor-
tantly, the pif1-m2 mutation suppresses the lethality of dna2D.
We thus evaluated the resection rate in both pif1-m2 and
dna2D pif1-m2 strains. In the pif1-m2 mutant both initiation
and long-range resection occur as efficiently as in wild-type cells
(Figure S5). In a dna2D pif1-m2 doublemutant, initiation of resec-
tion is comparable to wild-type cells but long-range resection is
very defective (Figure 6A). To confirm that Dna2 is required to
produce long ssDNA, and that the defect in resection is not lim-
ited to one locus, we again used the SSA assay where repeats
flanking a DSB are separated by 25 kb. As expected, the double
mutant pif1-m2 rad51D was as proficient in SSA as rad51D,
whereas the triple mutant pif1-m2 rad51D dna2D was very de-
fective in SSA (!10% repair) (Figure 6B). The defect in SSA
was slightly more severe than that observed in sgs1D rad51D
(!17% repair), suggesting that the alternative Exo1-dependent
resection pathway is more active in sgs1D than in dna2D or
that Dna2 has an additional role in DSB repair. We conclude
that Dna2 likely corresponds to the second nuclease besides
Exo1 responsible for the formation of long ssDNA tails at a DSB.
Exo1 Promotes Resection in the Absence of Dna2
To verify the relationship of Sgs1 and Dna2 with respect to DSB
end resection we constructed the triple mutant sgs1D dna2D
pif1-m2 and found that the initiation of resection is comparable
to wild-type cells whereas progression of resection is severely
impaired (Figure 6A). Importantly the defects in resection in
pif1-m2 dna2D and sgs1D dna2D pif1-m2 cells are comparable,
suggesting that Sgs1 and Dna2 may work in a common pathway
to produce long ssDNA. Epistasis between Dna2 and Exo1 could
notbeestablished since the triplemutantdna2Dexo1Dpif1-m2 is
not viable. Analysis of 150 tetrads from a dna2/DNA2 EXO1/exo1
pif1-m2/PIF1 diploid strain did not yield a single dna2D exo1D
pif1-m2 viable colony. Instead we constructed DNA2 under the
regulatable TetO7 promoter in which DNA2 expression is shut
off by the addition of doxocycline to the growthmedia (Mnaimneh
et al., 2004). In the presence of 25 mg/ml doxocycline the TetO7::
TATA::DNA2 strain becomes inviable (data not shown) and the
resection rate is as slow as in dna2D pif1-m2 (Figure 6A). We
then constructed the TetO7::TATA::DNA2 exo1D strain and
tested the resection rate in the presence and absence of doxocy-
cline. Strikingly we observed very slow resection in the presence
of doxocycline,with thecharacteristicpattern of additional bands

below the initial HO cut band (Figure 6D) previously observed in
the double mutant sgs1D exo1D (Figure 5A). Altogether these
data show that Exo1 and Dna2 are the two nucleases with redun-
dant functions in DSB end resection.
The Nuclease Domain of Dna2 Is Required
for Processing DSB Ends
Dna2 may function in 50 end resection as a nuclease and/or heli-
case. To verify which of these two activities is responsible for

resection, we constructed dna2D pif1-m2 strains harboring plas-
mids expressing the wild-type DNA2 gene or mutant dna2 with
a single amino acid substitution in either the helicase domain
(dna2-R1253Q) or the nuclease domain (dna2-E675A). These
mutationswerepreviouslyshown toeliminate thehelicaseandnu-
cleaseactivities, respectively (Buddet al., 2000; FormosaandNit-
tis, 1999; Lee et al., 2000).We then determined the resection rates
in these mutants and found that expression of either wild-type
DNA2 or the helicase-deficient dna2-R1253Q mutant restores 50
resection, whereas dna2-E675A does not (Figure 6C). Therefore,
Dna2 nuclease activity is important for 50 strand resection.
Dna2 and Sgs1 Are Recruited to DSB Ends and Spread
away from DSB Ends as Resection Progresses
We identified two new factors required for normal DSB end
resection: Dna2 and Sgs1. We anticipated that both proteins

are recruited to the break early and are propagated away from
DSB ends as resection progresses. Using chromatin immuno-
precipitation (ChIP) we monitored Sgs1 and Dna2 recruitment
to DSB ends. We demonstrate that both proteins are rapidly re-
cruited to the region immediately adjacent to the DSB ends
within 1 hr after break induction and gradually move 5 to 10 kb
away from the break at 4 hr after DNA cleavage (Figure 7A).
Dna2 recruitment was also followed using fluorescence micros-
copy. After HO break induction Dna2-GFP forms nuclear foci
that overlap with Rad52 foci (Figures 7B and 7C). Consistent
with our ChIP data almost 50% of cells have a single Dna2-
GFP focus at 1 hr after break induction. Notably, the binding pat-
terns of Sgs1 and Dna2 are substantially different from that of the
MRX complex whose recruitment is almost exclusively limited to
the sequence right next to the DNA break (Shroff et al., 2004).
Therefore, the results further support our model that the role of
MRX in resection is restricted to the very ends of a DSB, whereas
Sgs1 and Dna2 function to extend 30 single strands.
DISCUSSION
We identified multiple pathways in the initial step of DSB-in-
duced HR, 50 strand resection. A novel comprehensive model
of DSB end processing is presented in Figure 7D.
The Sgs1 Helicase Catalyzes DSB Resection
Wild-type cells resect DSB ends at an average rate of 4.4 kb/hr.
This rapid resection rate depends on the STR complex (Sgs1,
Top3, Rmi1) (Figure 7D). Sgs1 encodes a 30-50 helicase, a mem-
ber of the highly conserved RecQ family of helicases with crucial
roles in the maintenance of genome stability. Multiple functions
in DNA recombination and replication were assigned to RecQ
helicases including resolution of recombination intermediates,
disruption of Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments, and stabilization
of stalled replication forks (reviewed in Bachrati and Hickson,
2008; Branzei and Foiani, 2007). Interestingly all components
of the STR complex are required for an optimal level of resection.
Rmi1 stimulates the association of Top3 and Sgs1 with ssDNA
and may be required for proper STR complex recruitment
(Chen and Brill, 2007). Top3 may remove supercoiled DNA
formed by the Sgs1 helicase during resection. Deletion of any
component of the yeast STR complex or human BTB complex
elevates crossover recombination. Most likely these complexes
suppress crossover formation by dissolution of double Holliday
junction intermediates (Wu and Hickson, 2003). It remains to
be determined whether resection rate influences crossover re-
combination.
Dna2 and Exo1 Nucleases Process 50 Strands at a DSB
We identified two nucleases, Dna2 and Exo1, with redundant
activities in processing DSB ends. DNA2 is an essential gene
carrying two conserved domains: a RecB family nuclease motif
(Aravind et al., 2000; Bae et al., 1998) in the middle of the pro-
tein and a superfamily I helicase domain at the C terminus
(Budd et al., 1995). The nuclease domain alone is required for
50 strand processing of DSBs. Dna2 was shown previously to
clip off long 50 flaps even when they are coated with RPA,
a function not shared with the other known 50 flap nuclease,
Rad27 (Bae et al., 2001). For this reason, the role of Dna2
was previously assigned to the processing of long Okazaki
fragments.
While both Exo1 and Dna2 nucleases may process 50 strands
unwound by Sgs1, we favor Dna2 in this role for two reasons.
First, the resection defect and SSA deficiency observed in
sgs1D and dna2Dmutants are comparable inmagnitude and ep-
istatic. Second, long-range resection in the absence of Sgs1 or
Dna2 depends on Exo1. This result implies that Dna2 does not
contribute to resection in the absence of Sgs1 and vice versa. Al-
ternatively, the combined activity of Dna2 and Exo1 may provide
optimal processing of 50 strands unwound by Sgs1 since even
a single exo1Dmutant shows a modest defect in the processing
of DSB ends. Overexpression of EXO1 was shown to compen-
sate partially for the growth defect of a dna2-1mutant, support-
ing the model that these nucleases can process common
substrates (Budd et al., 2000). Within the first 3 kb from the break
site both Exo1 and Dna2 seem equally efficient in resection.
Therefore it remains to be determined which of these two en-
zymes plays a more prominent role in resection close to the
break in wild-type cells. DSB resection pathway choice may de-
pend on the cell-cycle stage as it has been demonstrated that
resection is very tightly controlled during the cell cycle (Ira
et al., 2004). Alternatively, the MRX complex that is specialized
in the initiation of resection may modulate how a cell processes
a DNA break by physical association with one of these factors.
Indeed, Sgs1 physically interacts with the MRX complex (Chiolo
et al., 2005).
MRX and Sae2 Initiate DSB Processing
Cells deficient in any component of the MRX/MRN complex or
Sae2/CtIP in both yeast andmammals are defective in HO endo-
nuclease- or g-irradiation-induced DSB end processing. Unlike
the rad50D and mre11D mutations, deletion of any other gene
analyzed here by itself does not delay the initiation of 50 strand
resection, suggesting a unique role for the MRX complex in facil-
itating initial DSB resection. Accordingly, rad50D cells that
managed to initiate resection catalyze subsequent 50 strand pro-
cessing at the wild-type rate. In mutants deprived of both Sgs1
(or Dna2) and Exo1, resection is limited to the very vicinity of
the DSB and depends on the MRX complex and Sae2. DNA 50
strands are processed there in a characteristic stepwise manner
with a pause at about every 100 bp. It is possible that this repre-
sents transient initial 50 resection intermediates that are quickly
converted to longer ssDNA ends by Sgs1, Dna2, and Exo1 and
are difficult to detect in wild-type cells. It remains to be deter-
mined whether Sae2 or Mre11 or both in a cooperative way are
responsible for this unique 50 strand processing (Lengsfeld
et al., 2007). Furthermore, MRX is recruited to unprocessed
DSB ends, maintained at the break only for a short time immedi-
ately after DSB induction, and cannot be detected by ChIP fur-
ther away from DSBs (Lisby et al., 2004; Shroff et al., 2004).
This contrasts with Sgs1 and Dna2, which are recruited to DSB
ends when they are initially processed, and both are propagated
away from the break as resection progresses (Figures 7A–7C).
Together these data strongly suggest that the role of MRX and
Sae2 in resection is limited to the very early stages of DSB repair
(Figure 7D).

Is the 50 Strand Resection Pathway Conserved
from Bacteria to Mammals?
In E. coli, aside from the major RecBCD-dependent pathway,
there is a second pathway promoting recombination—RecF.
In the RecF pathway, a combined activity of the RecQ helicase
and the RecJ nuclease promotes formation of ssDNA (Amund-
sen and Smith, 2003). In higher eukaryotes there are multiple
orthologs of the RecQ helicase, among which WRN was shown
in X. laevis egg extracts to promote 50 strand resection (Toczy-
lowski and Yan, 2006). A nuclease that works together with the
WRN helicase in DSB end resection has not yet been identified
but likely is a human Dna2 ortholog. Human Dna2 homolog
was found to have biochemical features remarkably similar to
its yeast counterpart (Kim et al., 2006; Masuda-Sasa et al.,
2006).
Benefits and Control of Multiple Pathways
of 50 Strand Processing
Yeast has multiple pathways to process 50 strands at mitotic
DSBs (Figure 7D). We showed that resection limited to the first
100–200 bp is enough to promote relatively efficient gene con-
version. Why do cells then produce such long 30 tails? The length
of ssDNA formed during DSB-induced gene conversion is not
known; however two lines of evidence suggest that at least
several kb of ssDNA are formed on each DSB end. First, se-
quences 2–3 kb away from the break are used preferentially
over sequences immediately next to the break for homology
search and repair (Inbar and Kupiec, 1999). Second, strand inva-
sion and new DNA synthesis primed by 30 tails are observed
about 1 to 2 hr after DSB formation (White andHaber, 1990), sug-
gesting that at least several kb of ssDNA must be formed given
that the observed rate of resection is 4.4 kb/hr. Long 30 tails pro-
duced by 50 strand processing may facilitate quick and efficient
DSB repair and robust DNA-damage checkpoint activation.
Furthermore, usage of short homology immediately adjacent to
the break site rather than longer homologous sequences may
increase the chances of recombination between short nonallelic
repeats leading to chromosome translocations. Indeed in sgs1D
mutants, increased ectopic recombination and recombination
between short homeologous sequences was reported (Myung
et al., 2001; Watt et al., 1996).
Multiple pathways probably allow cells to use specific pro-
cessing for different types of DNA damage. DNA breaks in the
middle of a chromosome or at telomere ends and breaks during
the mitotic or meiotic cell cycle all may require different process-
ing. In E. coli, RecBCD processes DSBs whereas RecQ/RecJ is
thought to play a more specialized role in processing spontane-
ous damage that yields single-strand gaps (Courcelle et al.,
2006; Hishida et al., 2004; Magner et al., 2007). In budding yeast,
Exo1 was shown to generate ssDNA at stalled replication forks in
checkpoint-deficient rad53D mutants (Cotta-Ramusino et al.,
2005), whereas telomere chromosome ends are protected
from Exo1 activity by the Ku70/Ku80 complex (Maringele and Ly-
dall, 2002). It will be of great interest to define which 50 resection
pathways contribute to the formation of ssDNA inmeiotic cells or
at telomeres, and how these processes are controlled in the cell
cycle to achieve genetic integrity.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Strains and Plasmids
All strains used in this study are derivatives of JKM139 (hoD hml::ADE1 MATa
hmr::ADE1 ade1 leu2-3,112 lys5 trp1::hisG ura3-52 ade3::GAL10::HO). All
strains and plasmids are listed in the Supplemental Data.
DSB Induction
Yeast cells were grown overnight in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2%
dextrose) and transferred to YEP raffinose medium (1% yeast extract, 2%
peptone, 2% raffinose) for one night. HO was induced when the cell density
was 1 3 107 cells/ml by adding 2% galactose. DSB end resection was ana-
lyzed only in experiments where at least 95% of the cells had experienced
an HO break within 1 hr after break induction.
DSB end Resection Analysis
50 strand processing was determined in all mutants and wild-type cells at least
three times. DNA isolated by glass bead disruption using a standard phenol
extraction method was digested with EcoRI and separated on 0.8% agarose
gels. Southern blotting and hybridization with radiolabeled DNA probes was
carried out as described previously (Church and Gilbert, 1985). Multiple DNA
probes used for hybridization to detect 50 strand resection beyond the EcoRI
site, as well as the sequences of DNA primers used to prepare the probes
by PCR, are listed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Intensities
of bands on Southern blots corresponding to probed DNA fragments were an-
alyzed with ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantities of DNA
loaded on gels for each time point were normalized using either an APA1 or
a TRA1 DNA probe. DSB end resection beyond each EcoRI site for each
time point was estimated as a percentage of the signal intensity corresponding
to the EcoRI fragment of interest 1 hr after break induction.
Measurement of Viability
To determine the viability in response to a repairable DSB, cells were grown
overnight in 2% raffinose medium and appropriate culture dilutions were
plated onto YEPD and YEP-galactose plates. The proportion of viable cells
was estimated by dividing the number of colony-forming units on YEP-galac-
tose plates by that on YEPD plates.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
ChIP assays for Dna2-9xMyc were performed as described previously (Shim
et al., 2007). In Sgs1-9xMyc ChIP we used Ethylene Glycol-bis[succinimidyl
succinate] (EGS) and formaldehyde as crosslinking agents (Zeng et al.,
2006). a-Myc antibody was purchased from Covance (9E10). After immuno-
precipitation and reverse crosslinking, purified DNA was analyzed by real-
time quantitative PCR using multiple sets of primers that anneal 0.1 kb, 1 kb,
and 5 kb from the DSB, as well as primers specific for the PRE1 gene situated
on chromosome V as a control.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Live-cell photographs were captured using an EM-CCD digital camera (Hama-
matsu) connected to an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss) with a Plan-Apo-
chromat 1.4 N.A. 1003 objective lens and an EGFP Filter (Chroma #41017).
To quantify the amount of cells that contain Dna2-GFP foci, 11 pictures
were taken along the Z axis at 0.3 mm intervals with an acquisition time of
750 ms. Pictures were captured and analyzed using AxioVision Rel. 4.6 Soft-
ware (Zeiss).
