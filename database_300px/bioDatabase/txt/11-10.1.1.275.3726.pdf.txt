ABSTRACT
Most type II restriction–modification (R–M) systems
produce separate restriction endonuclease (REase)
and methyltransferase (MTase) proteins. After R–M
system genes enter a new cell, protective MTase
must appear before REase to avoid host chromo-
some cleavage. The basis for this apparent temporal
regulation is not well understood. PvuII and some
other R–M systems appear to achieve this delay by
cotranscribing the REase gene with the gene for an
autogenous transcription activator/repressor (the
‘C’ protein C.PvuII). To test this model, bacterio-
phage M13 was used to introduce the PvuII genes
into a bacterial population in a relatively synchronous
manner. REase mRNA and activity appeared »10min
after those of the MTase, but never rose if there was
an inactivating pvuIIC mutation. Infection with
recombinant M13pvuII phage had little effect on cell
growth, relative to infection with parental M13.
However, infection of cells pre-expressing C.PvuII
led to cessation of growth. This study presents the
first direct demonstration of delayed REase expres-
sion, relative toMTase, when type II R–M genes enter
a new host cell. Surprisingly, though the C and REase
genes are cotranscribed, the pvuIIC portion of the
mRNA was more abundant than the pvuIIR portion
after stable establishment of the R–M system.
INTRODUCTION
Most bacteria and archaea possess restriction–modiﬁca-
tion (R–M) systems (1), in part for defense against DNA
bacteriophages. PvuII, like most type II R–M systems,
includes two independently active enzymes: a restriction
endonuclease (REase) that cleaves DNA at a target
sequence, and a methyltransferase (MTase) that modiﬁes
the same sequence to protect it from the REase (2). These
two activities must be carefully balanced to ensure
protection of the host chromosome. Moreover, this
balance must achieve both appropriate steady-state
levels and have suitable kinetics of expression following
horizontal transfer of the R–M genes (3). The protective
MTase must be expressed in advance of the REase, so as
to protect the new host before REase appears. Where this
does not occur, there is strong selection for mutation of
the REase gene [e.g. in R+M– subclones (4)].
The mechanisms of R–M gene expression and regula-
tion are still unclear. R–M systems consisting of just the
REase and MTase genes do not rely on passive regulation,
determined by ﬁxing the relative strengths of promoters
for the two genes (5–8), suggesting that the appropriate
expression ratios change with conditions. Several R–M
systems contain a third gene (C, for ‘controlling’),
including PvuII (9), BamHI (10), BclI (11), BglII (12),
Esp1396I (13), EcoO109I (14), EcoRV (15), Eco72I (16),
HgiAI (17), BstLVI (18), Kpn2I (19), SmaI (20), BclI (11)
and AhdI (21). The C proteins are small, dimeric proteins
that bind DNA via a helix–turn–helix domain (11,21–23),
and have an activation patch resembling that on CI
protein from bacteriophage lambda (22–25). These C
genes are well conserved, and even interchangeable in
some cases, despite the diﬀerent DNA speciﬁcities of their
associated R–M genes and the genetic distances between
their host bacteria (10,26). They fall into several com-
plementation groups (26).
In all C-dependent R–M systems studied to date, the
REase gene is tightly linked to (and often overlaps) the
upstream C gene, and in all examined cases but one (27)
the REase gene is completely dependent on transcription
from the C promoter. Autogenous activation of the
pvuIICR promoter occurs via the C protein binding
to upstream operators called ‘C-boxes’ (24,28,29)
(Figure 1A). Recently, the C protein from the PvuII
R–M system was shown to act not only as an autogenous

transcriptional activator, but also as an eﬃcient repressor
(29), as predicted on theoretical grounds for C.AhdI (21).
Subsequent experimental and modeling studies suggest
that, for C.AhdI, the repression results from binding
competition between the regulator and RNA polymerase
(30). In the studied systems, C protein has either little or
negative eﬀect on MTase expression; for example, in the
Eco72I system the C protein reduces MTase expression
10-fold (16).
As no C protein is present when the R–M genes ﬁrst
enter a new host cell, REase gene transcription is very
limited, but is believed to increase rapidly due to the
positive feedback loop. This view is consistent with
observations that, ﬁrst, pre-expressing C protein in a cell
prevents transformation by the intact R–M system,
presumably due to premature expression of the REase;
and second, the absence of active C protein is associated
with very low or nonexpression of the REase (24,26,28).
However, the expected delay in REase versus MTase
expression has to date been inferred from steady-state
behavior of various mutants or clones, and never directly
demonstrated or measured.
We present here the ﬁrst direct evidence for a C protein
role in temporal regulation of the REase gene, following
the entry of a C-dependent R–M system into a new host
cell. Our approach was to use bacteriophage M13 to
introduce the PvuII genes into a bacterial population. This
allowed the gene transfer to be carried out over a short
period of time and with minimal physiological disturbance
of bacterial culture (compared to transformation, for
example). PvuII gene expression was measured via quanti-
tative real-time RT–PCR and enzyme activity assays. Our
results indicate a signiﬁcant lag between MTase and
REase expression, and show that—despite their cotrans-
cription—REase transcript levels roughly follow those of
the C gene but at a lower level.

‘Materials and methods’ section. All results were normalized to the wt level of pvuIIM mRNA and standard error bars from three determinations
are shown. (C) PvuII transcript stability. At time=0, rifampicin was added to an exponential culture of E. coli TOP10F’ growing in LB medium.
The mRNA levels were determined via QRT–PCR, using stable 5 S rRNA as the internal standard as described in ‘Materials and methods’ section.
The circles represent pvuIIM (white), pvuIIC (gray) and pvuIIR (black). All three mRNA levels are normalized to 100% at time=0 (the three points
overlap). The data were ﬁtted to an exponential decay, after a short initial phase of more rapid decay (see text). Standard error bars from three
determinations are shown.

(Invitrogen) was used as the host strain for M13 phage
infections. Escherichia coli TOP10 (without the F’
plasmid; Invitrogen) was used for all other purposes
including cloning steps. The recombinant M13 bacterio-
phages M13pvuIIwt (C+ phenotype) and M13pvuIIEsp19
(C– phenotype; contains an in-frame insertion of one Leu
codon into the upstream helix of the C.PvuII helix–turn–
helix motif) were generated by cloning the entire
PCR-ampliﬁed 2.04-kb PvuII R–M system into BamHI-
and EcoRI-linearized M13mp19 replicative form (RF)
DNA, using ‘PV’ primers (Table 2). Plasmids pPvuRM3.4
(4) and pPvuRM3.4–Esp19 (22) were used as template.
M13cat was generated by cloning a SacI- and BamHI-
cleaved, PCR-ampliﬁed cat gene (‘cat’ primers, Table 2),
using pACYC184 as the template and M13mp18 RF as
vector (linearized with the same enzymes). All phage
lysates were made following transfection of E. coli
TOP10F’ cells in accordance with standard methods
(34). Infectious phage titers were determined by plaque
formation on the same strain by the top agar overlay
technique (34). Due to instability of M13 clones (35), the
phage stocks were prepared from nonpassaged (original
preparation) M13 RF DNA via transfection.

as M13 infection can lead to loss of F factors (36). After
dilution, the culture was grown to OD600nm=0.23, then
split into four equal portions. Of these, one was infected
with M13pvuIIwt, one with M13pvuIIEsp19, one with
M13mp19 (vector control) and the fourth was an
uninfected control (Figure S1). The multiplicity of
infection (MOI) was 5 PFU/CFU if not otherwise indi-
cated. Triplicate samples were collected over a period of
70min. The ﬁrst replicate sample in each case was used for
total RNA isolation, the second was used for genomic
DNA isolation and the third was sonicated for use in
endonuclease activity assays. Eﬃciencies of plaquing
(EOPs) were calculated by dividing the phage titers on
the tested strain [E. coli TOP10F’ (p200; pvuIIC wt) or
(p201; pvuIIC-Esp19) by the titers on reference strain
[E. coli TOP10F’ (pACYC177)].
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Culture sample volumes were corrected for OD to
maintain similar cell numbers per sample. Samples were
immediately mixed with 3ml of RNA Protect reagent
(Qiagen) and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNAs were obtained, after RQ1
RNase-free DNase (Promega) treatment, by using random
hexamers (Invitrogen) and ImProm-II Reverse Transcrip-
tase (Promega). For the mRNA stability experiment,
culture samples were taken starting 30 s prior to addition
of rifampicin (500 mg/ml), and total RNA was extracted
and cDNAs prepared as above. The half-lives of trans-
cripts were determined by ﬁtting the percentage of mRNA
remaining versus time to an exponential decay function.
QRT–PCR
Primers were designed with PrimerQuest software
(Integrated DNA Technologies) to ensure the same Tm
and similar PCR product size. The following primers were
used to amplify the segments of the following genes:
pvuIIM, pvuIIR, pvuIIC, M13gII, M13gVIII, recA,
5SrRNA (Figure 1A; Table 2). A LightCycler (Roche)
was used with LightCycler software. Real-time PCR was
performed in triplicate, and ﬁnal products were conﬁrmed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. Each reaction contained
2 ml of diluted cDNA template (1:10) and 8 ml of mixture:
dNTPs (0.2mM), PCR buﬀer (1), primers (1mM),
SYBR Green I dye (1:20 000) and Platinum Taq DNA
polymerase (0.5U) (Invitrogen). The PCR employed the
following cycling parameters: 958C for 2min, followed by
40 cycles of 948C for 5 s, 598C for 5 s, 728C for 15 s each;
and ﬁnally the melting curve (59–948C) program for
quality control, and cooling to 408C.
The mRNA levels for the target genes were quantiﬁed
from the Ct value, which is the PCR cycle number
at which the ﬂuorescence crosses a predeﬁned threshold.
The threshold value is selected on the basis of being well
above the background noise level, but less than half of
the level at which ﬂuorescences eventually plateaus. The
levels of gene expression for each gene were normalized to
the level of the reference housekeeping gene recA in all
studies except the mRNA stability assay, where 5 S rRNA
was used as the internal, stable marker. RecA expression
is not aﬀected by M13 infection (37,38). Furthermore,
the strains used to carry the recA1 allele, preventing
induction of an SOS response (in which recA itself would
be induced) (39). Data were averaged for each set of
replicates. For M13 infection experiments, the relative
fold-change mRNAs ratios were obtained by normalizing
each time point data in reference to the earliest measure-
ments. The calculations also included PCR eﬃciency,
where each cDNA was serially diluted and its Ct was
plotted to calculate the slope corresponding to PCR
eﬃciency (40,41). Investigated transcripts showed optimal
PCR eﬃciencies: 2.019 for pvuIIR, 2.053 for pvuIIM, 2.18
for pvuIIC, 1.99 for M13gII, 2.12 for M13gVIII and 2.09
for recA (internal reference gene) with high linearity
(R2> 0.98).
MTase protection activity assay
The MTase protection test analyzed the methylation
status of selected PvuII sites on the E. coli K-12 chromo-
some, following the M13 phage infection. Genomic DNA
from each sample, isolated from culture samples at
various times after infection, was puriﬁed using a
Wizard Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Promega).
Portions of genomic DNA (20 mg) were digested overnight
with HindIII and PvuII, separated by electrophoresis on
0.8% agarose gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes
(Millipore) in 20 SSC buﬀer. The DNA was then ﬁxed to
the membrane by UV irradiation. The two speciﬁc probes
H1 (733 bp; primers H1) and H3 (857 bp; primers H3)
(Table 2) were prepared by PCR, and labeled with biotin
using a Biotin High Prime Kit (Roche). Membranes were
hybridized with the H1 and H3 probes at the same time,
at 558C for 12 h in hybridization buﬀer (each probe at
30 ng/ml of buﬀer). Membranes were developed using a
North2South Chemiluminescent Hybridization and
Detection Kit (Pierce) as recommended.
REase activity assay
Samples were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets
were rinsed with PBS. After centrifugation, the cells were
resuspended in 100 ml of buﬀer A (10mM K/PO4 pH 7.0,
30mM KCl, 1mM Na2EDTA, 10mM 2-mercaptoethanol
and 5% glycerol v/v) and disrupted by sonication
(10 bursts of 5 s) at 48C in a cup horn probe. Cellular
debris was removed by centrifugation (3000g, 10min).
PvuII REase activity was assayed in a 20-ml reaction
mixture containing: 0.5 mg of bacteriophage  DNA,
10mM Tris–HCl pH 7.9, 50mM NaCl, 10mM MgCl2,
1mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 5 ml of the clariﬁed cell
lysate. Reactions were incubated for 10min at 378C, and
the DNA was resolved on 0.8% agarose gels.
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay
The CAT ELISA kit (Roche) was used to colorimetrically
quantitate CAT reporter levels based on a sandwich
ELISA method. The recommended protocol was followed
with some modiﬁcations. The culture was grown in LB
medium, infected with M13cat phage and time-point
samples were collected until 70min of postinfection.
Samples (1ml each) were removed, pelletted and
2584 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 8
resuspended in 0.5ml of lysis buﬀer (100mM K/PO4
pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 5mg/ml BSA, 1mM DTT,
5mg/ml lysozyme) and kept for 20min at RT. The
centrifugally cleared cell extracts were diluted 1:25 and
loaded onto microplate modules with anti-CAT antibo-
dies prebound to the surface. CAT concentration was
calculated as nanograms per milliliter of culture at
OD600nm.
RESULTS
Steady-state level of PvuII transcripts
Before studying the kinetics of PvuII gene expression,
following introduction into new host cells, we ﬁrst
analyzed the steady-state behavior of these genes. We
grew two E. coli K-12 (TOP10F’) strains in parallel, each
of them bearing a pBR322-derived plasmid. One plasmid
carried the intact PvuII R–M system [pPvuRM3.4, active
C.PvuII protein, ‘C+’ phenotype (4)], and the second
plasmid diﬀered only in having an in-frame insertion in
pvuIIC (pPvuRM3.4-Esp19). This mutation adds a Leu
codon into the helix–turn–helix motif, reducing PvuII
restriction to background levels (22), and eliminating
detectable DNA binding by C.PvuII (28) (‘C–’phenotype).
The strain pair was grown to mid-exponential phase in LB
medium, total RNA was isolated and gene expression was
monitored by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase
PCR. We used probe sets that measured pvuIIM and
polycistronic pvuIICR transcripts (dumbbell shapes in
Figure 1A). Previous studies have shown that there are
two alternative promoters for pvuIICR transcription
(Figure 1A). One promoter leads to initiation within the
C-boxes, is independent of C.PvuII but very weak, and is
believed to provide necessary initial amounts of pvuIIC
transcription to prime the positive feedback loop; while
the second promoter yields a leaderless message that is
only produced in the presence of C.PvuII (24).
Transcription of pvuIIM occurs from a pair of promoters
within pvuIIC, both of which appear to be minimally
aﬀected by C.PvuII (22).
The quantitative analysis conﬁrms earlier observations
(22,28) that C.PvuII has little or no eﬀect on pvuIIM
expression (Figure 1B, white bars). In the presence of
active C.PvuII, pvuIIM transcript levels are 5-fold
(4.9 0.7) more abundant than those of pvuIIR. Despite
being cotranscribed (28), pvuIIC mRNA is twice (1.8 
0.4) as abundant as pvuIIR mRNA (Figure 1B). In
C.PvuII– cells, where the mutation consists of a one-
codon (sense) insertion, pvuIICR mRNA is about 10-fold
less abundant than in C.PvuII+ cells when measured
within the C segment, and about 50-fold less abundant
when measured in the R segment (Figure 1B). This low-
level transcription presumably relies on the weak
C-independent pvuIICR promoter (24). These measure-
ments are consistent with earlier assays of pvuIIC-cat
transcriptional fusions (28).
To test whether the diﬀerences in mRNA abundance are
due to diﬀerential stability, we measured the rate of
disappearance of each mRNA species following culture
treatment with the transcription initiation inhibitor
rifampicin (Figure 1C). Both pvuIIM and pvuIICR
transcripts have similar decay patterns. The PvuII
mRNAs appear to undergo rapid initial decay, within
2min decaying to 55% for pvuIIM, 41% and 33% for
pvuIICR probed separately in the R and C segments,
respectively. A possible explanation for this rapid initial
phase of decay is discussed below. The initial rapid
turnover is followed by slower exponential decay that was
used to calculate the half-lives. MTase mRNA was slightly
more stable, with a half-life of 4.7min. The bicistronic
pvuIICRmRNA, probed independently within pvuIIC and
pvuIIR, yielded half-lives of 3.8min for the C segment,
and 4.3min for the R segment (Figure 1C). These half-
lives are in the average range of transcript stability, with
the half-life of bulk E. coli mRNA being 2.4min at 378C
(32,42). Combining these results, neither the rapid decay
of 60% of pvuIIR versus 70% of pvuIIC, nor the
longer-term half-life ratio of 1.1 (R/C) can explain the
presence of about twice as much pvuIIC as pvuIIR mRNA
during steady-state growth (Figure 1B).
M13 bacteriophage infection model
To study the timing role of the C.PvuII feedback circuit,
and to test its inferred delaying eﬀect on REase gene
expression, we developed a system for relatively synchro-
nous introduction of the PvuII R–M genes into the
bacterial population via infection with recombinant
bacteriophage M13. We ﬁrst performed pilot M13
infection studies, in which actively growing E. coli F’
cells were infected with M13mp19 or M13cat (carrying a
cat gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. Samples were taken
every 5min, through 70min postinfection (Figure 2).
When cells were infected with M13cat phage, CAT
protein was detectable by ELISA about 20min postinfec-
tion (Figure 2C), which agrees with measurements of the
M13 infection-to-release time of 15–20min (43,44)
(Supplementary Data; Figure S2). As cat expression
does not rely on accumulation of an activator, this result
suggested an appropriate time range for subsequent
experiments. At the same time, we monitored culture
growth, conﬁrming the expected slowdown for the M13-
infected culture (Figure 2A).
M13 phage transcript levels were determined for the
growing culture infected with M13mp19 phage
(Figure 2B). Total RNA from the culture samples was
isolated and prepared for quantitative analysis via QRT–
PCR (Materials and methods section). We probed for
M13 mRNA from genes II and VIII. M13 gII is one of the
earliest transcripts, the product of which is involved in
DNA replication (45), while gVIII is the most abundant
mRNA and speciﬁes the major capsid protein (46). We
measured the relative mRNA fold change with respect to
the very initial level (1min after infection) and normalized
to E. coli recA. Previous microarray analysis indicated
that M13 infection does not signiﬁcantly alter recA
expression (37). Phage transcripts (gII and gVIII) rose
detectably about 20min after infection, as was found for
cat expression, and the levels of phage transcripts kept
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 8 2585
increasing over the monitored time course of 70min
(Figure 2B).
We found it necessary to carry out these experiments in
the presence of tetracycline, which selects for maintenance
of the F’ plasmid that makes the cells infectable by
ﬁlamentous phage such as M13 (47,48). M13-infected cells
have a tendency to eliminate F plasmids (36). Whatever
the mechanism may be, in the absence of tetracycline the
levels of M13 gene expression (phage-speciﬁc or cloned),
M13 DNA, and M13 plaque-forming units all show
a pronounced cycling behavior (Figure S2) that made
relative temporal measurements more diﬃcult.
‘Short-circuiting’ effect of C.PvuII pre-expression
One of the forms of evidence suggesting a key role for the
C.PvuII feedback circuit in controlling the delayed
expression of REase relative to MTase is that pre-
expression of C.PvuII in cells prevents their transforma-
tion by the intact R–M system (26,28). Since C.PvuII
activates transcription of pvuIIR, this observation was
interpreted as indicating that pre-expression of C.PvuII
led to immediate expression of pvuIIR, and lethally
premature appearance of REase activity. To test the
physiological relevance of the M13 model, we determined
whether the M13-mediated transfer of PvuII genes was
sensitive to pre-expression of C.PvuII. We used host cells
carrying plasmids with no pvuIIC (pACYC177 vector
control), wt pvuIIC (pIM200) or pvuIIC-Esp19 (pIM201)
(neither pvuIIM nor pvuIIR was present in any of these
plasmids). We then measured the EOP (Materials and
methods section) in all possible host–phage pairings of
the three E. coli strains with three M13 phage stocks
carrying the intact PvuII R–M system (M13pvuIIwt),
the PvuII system with a defective pvuIICEsp19 allele
(M13pvuIIEsp19), or with no PvuII genes (M13mp19;
phage vector control). Each set of EOPs was normalized
to the titer obtained for the vector control E. coli host with
that phage stock.
The results obtained for host cells with pre-expressed
wt C.PvuII indicate that, as expected, the EOP of M13
carrying the intact PvuII R–M system is reduced (about
3-fold relative to cells having no pre-expressed C.PvuII;
Figure 3A). Surprisingly, pre-expression of the defective
mutant pvuIIC allele (that has an in-frame one-codon
insertion) also reduced the EOP of M13pvuIIwt, by about
3-fold. One possible explanation of this result is that
C.PvuIIEsp19 can form heterodimers with wt C.PvuII,
and that these heterodimers can activate transcription of
PpvuIICR thus leading to premature REase expression.
This interpretation is consistent with the result of the
reciprocal experiment (Figure 3A) that M13 bearing the
pvuIIC-Esp19 allele shows reduced EOP on cells that have
pre-expressed wt C.PvuII from the plasmid, but not on
cells that have produced C.PvuIIEsp19 and have no source
of wt C.PvuII subunits.
The reductions in EOP due to ‘short circuiting’ were
correlated with much smaller plaque size than were seen in
control infections. The smaller plaques also appeared to
be less turbid than control M13 plaques (Supplementary
Data; Figure S3). Recombinant M13 coding for EcoRI
REase infects and kills the host cells, forming clear
plaques in comparison to the turbid growth zones
produced by plain M13 (49). These observations suggest
that more-severe growth restriction (and possibly cell
death) occurs after infection of cells with pre-expressed
pvuIIC, limiting the production of progeny phage. To test
this possibility, we determined the eﬀect of pvuIIC pre-
expression on the growth of E. coli TOP10F’ cells follow-
ing M13pvuIIwt infection (Figure 3B). We monitored
growth in LB medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm=0.25)

and then infected at an MOI of 5 or 50 PFU/CFU. Two
cultures were tested: with pvuIIC present on a plasmid
(pIM200) or absent (pACYC177 vector control). We saw
signiﬁcantly lower culture densities for the infected cells,
and this eﬀect was enhanced where wt C.PvuII was pre-
expressed (Figure 3B). These observations support the
interpretation that pre-expression of C.PvuII prevents
transformation by the intact PvuII R–M system by killing
the host cell (26,28), and are consistent with the physio-
logical relevance of the M13-based model for R–M system
gene expression.
Introduction of PvuII R–M genes into the new host cells via
recombinantM13 bacteriophage infection: kinetics of
mRNA appearance
To study PvuII gene establishment in a new host, we
used the two M13 recombinant stocks carrying the PvuII
genes: M13pvuIIwt (C+ phenotype) and M13pvuIIEsp19
(C– phenotype due to an insertion of one sense codon)
(Table 1). The host cells for infection (which contained
no PvuII genes) were grown to exponential phase, and
split into four equal portions. Of these, one was infected
with M13pvuIIwt, one with M13pvuIIEsp19, one with
M13mp19 (vector control), each with an MOI of 5 PFU/
CFU and the fourth was an uninfected control (Supple-
mentary Data; Figure S1). All three infected cultures grew
more slowly than the uninfected culture, but the restricting
phage did not cause worse growth than the others
(Figure S1).
Using RNA prepared from these culture samples, the
accumulation of PvuII mRNAs was measured as
described in ‘Materials and methods’ section. In addition
to pvuIIM, pvuIICR was probed separately for the pvuIIC
and pvuIIR segments (see Figure 1B). As might be
expected for the infection with M13pvuIIwt (C+ pheno-
type), pvuIIM mRNA levels rose above background about
20min postinfection, similar to what had been seen for
cat and M13 phage genes in pilot experiments (Figure 2).
In contrast, the appearance of pvuIIR mRNA was delayed
to about 30min postinfection (Figure 4A). The levels
of pvuIIM and pvuIIR transcripts eventually reached
about the same 5:1 ratio seen in steady-state cultures
(Figure 1B), by about 45min postinfection. Although
pvuIIC and pvuIIR share the same transcript (28), the level
of mRNA probed for C or R separately (Figure 1A) was
not the same through the time course of the experiment.
By about 40min postinfection, the C/R ratio reached
the value of 2 that was observed for transcripts from
the plasmid-borne PvuII genes (Figure 1B, and see
‘Discussion’ section).
When cells were infected by phage carrying a defective
in-frame (sense) mutation in pvuIIC (M13pvuII-Esp19),
the REase transcript level never rose above the back-
ground level (Figure 4B). The small rise in the low pvuIIC
transcript level, about 40min after infection, is presum-
ably due to the weak C-independent promoter (24).
Surprisingly, while C.PvuII had no eﬀect on the
steady-state ‘level’ of pvuIIM mRNA (Figure 1B), it did
have eﬀects on the ‘kinetics’ of pvuIIM expression

Figure 3. Eﬀect of pre-expression of wt pvuIIC on PvuII R–M establishment. (A) Three E. coli TOP10F’ host strains were used that carried no
pvuIIC gene (pACYC177 vector control), carried wt pvuIIC (pIM200), or carried the defective pvuIIC-Esp19 (pIM201). The eﬃciency of plaquing
(EOP) was measured after infecting each strain with each of three M13 phage stocks: one with the wt PvuII R–M system (M13pvuIIwt; black bars,
marked ‘W’ for ‘wt’), one with pvuIIC-Esp19 in the PvuII R–M system (M13pvuIIEsp19; gray bars, marked ‘C–‘) and one with no PvuII genes
(M13mp19; white bars, marked ‘V’ for ‘vector’). Each dataset was normalized to the titration result obtained for that phage stock on the vector
control host E. coli TOP10F’ (pACYC177). These normalization values would yield three bars at height 1.0 and are not shown (the actual values
were very close: M13mp19=1.6 1011, M13pvuIIwt=1.4 1011 and M13pvuIIEsp19=1.4 1011 PFU/ml). The error bars represent the standard
deviations from triplicate measurements. (B) Two cultures of E. coli TOP10F’ were used, that harbored either no pvuIIC (pACYC177; circles) or wt
pvuIIC (pIM200; squares). When their growth in LB medium reach mid-log phase (OD600nm=0.25), the cultures were divided into three portions.
One portion was infected with M13pvuIIwt at an MOI of 50 (black symbols), one at an MOI of 5 (gray) and the third portion remained uninfected
(white). The growth of the culture was monitored as OD600nm. The bars represent standard deviations from two experiments.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 8 2587
(compare Figure 4A and B). After infection with the
C.PvuII– M13, MTase mRNA started to accumulate
about 30min postinfection, rising more rapidly after
40min; in both cases this is 10min later than following
infection with M13pvuIIwt.
As a control, the accumulation of M13 DNA was also
measured for the infection with M13pvuIIwt (data not
shown). At all times tested, the ratio between the two
identically oriented genes pvuIIC and M13gII was close to
1 (averaging 1.46, and ranging from 0.96 to 2.01) consis-
tent with stability of the DNA insert in M13 genome. This
had been a concern because many longer M13 inserts are
subject to accumulation of spontaneous deletions during
replication (50).
Introduction of PvuII R–M genes into the new host cells
via recombinantM13 bacteriophage infection: kinetics
of activity appearance
The 10-min delay between appearance of pvuIIM and
pvuIIR transcripts is important to our understanding of
R–M system mobility. However, this delay does not
provide information about the actual rate of protection of
the host chromosome. In other words, it is not clear
(except by inference) whether a 10-min delay is suﬃcient.
The average E. coli cell growing exponentially in rich
medium has about two full-chromosome equivalents (51),
or about 9 Mbp of DNA, that would have to be protected
during the delay before REase appearance.

section). TOP10F’ cells were infected with M13 carrying wt pvuIIC (A) or the null pvuIIC-Esp19 allele (B) in the context of the full PvuII R–M
system. The various mRNAs are shown as pvuIIM (blue), pvuIIC (orange), pvuIIR (red). (C, D) In vivo kinetics of E. coli chromosomal DNA

digestion with PvuII REase was detected by probing Southern blots with speciﬁc biotinylated PCR products. The control lanes contained DNA from
uninfected cells (K1; gives the pattern expected for unprotected DNA), or digested with only HindIII (K2; gives the pattern expected for fully
methylated DNA). (E, F) In vivo kinetics of REase activity following entry of the PvuII R–M system. The M13pvuII phages carried either wt pvuIIC

DNA from bacteriophage . Lane K3 shows the same DNA digested by commercial PvuII REase (NEB).
2588 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 8
To address this question, we determined the rate of host
chromosome protection from restriction, and the rate of
appearance of active REase, following infection with
M13pvuII. The MTase protection test analyzed the
methylation status of selected PvuII sites from among
the 1430 (52) on the E. coliK-12 chromosome [GenBank
U00096 (53)]. Genomic DNA, isolated from culture
samples at various times after infection, was digested
with HindIII (to generate deﬁned methylation-
independent fragments) and PvuII REase, and resolved
on an agarose gel. Southern blots were probed with biotin-
labeled DNA speciﬁc to regions adjacent to selected PvuII
sites (Materials and methods section). If the tested PvuII
sites were being methylated, then longer (uncut) DNA
fragments would appear over time (Figure 4C and D, as in
control lanes K1 versus K2).
In vivo PvuII methylation activity was observed and, as
with the pvuIIM transcription data, the rate of appearance
was slightly diﬀerent between the C.PvuII cultures
(Figure 4C and D). DNA from samples taken 5–20min
postinfection was unmethylated (Figure 4C and D, lanes
5–20), as expected since pvuIIM transcripts were not
expressed at that time (Figure 4A and B). About 25min
after infection, the methylated pattern started to appear,
and was pronounced by 40min for C.PvuII+ infections
(Figure 4C; lanes 40–70). The same was observed, but on a
delayed basis, for C.PvuII infections, where methylation
started to appear about 40min postinfection and was
pronounced 10min later (Figure 4D). Late in the
infection, samples showed the partial methylation
expected for a mixed population of infected and unin-
fected cells (Supplementary Data).
One possible contributing factor to these results derives
from the fact that we are measuring population averages,
and not methylation in individual cells. It is possible in
theory that a subset of cells does not suﬃciently protect
its chromosomal DNA before REase appears, and is killed
as a result. Even if these cells did not lyze, their cleaved
DNA might be rapidly degraded (54,55), selectively
removing unmethylated DNA from our assessment.
Consistent with this possibility, the relative amount of
protected DNA appears to be lower in the absence of
restriction (Figure 4C versus 4D). This would not,
however, aﬀect determination of the time of onset of
methylation.
The REase activity assay was based on crude extract
digestions of DNA from bacteriophage . For
M13pvuIIwt (C+ phenotype), REase activity became
evident about 35min postinfection (Figure 4E), corre-
sponding to its mRNA proﬁle (Figure 4A). In contrast,
for M13pvuIIEsp19 (C phenotype), REase activity was
not detected over the 70-min course of the experiment
(Figure 4F).
DISCUSSION
BacteriophageM13 model system
To study PvuII gene establishment in a new host, we chose
to use a nonlytic phage model. This presents substantial
advantages over transformation- or conjugation-based
approaches. For transformation (including electropora-
tion), the cells are profoundly disturbed physiologically by
the preparatory washing procedures, heat or electrical
shock, and shift into a rich medium (56,57). Gene expres-
sion studies in such cells would thus be very diﬃcult to
interpret (58). Transfer into a population of new hosts via
conjugation occurs over a longer time period, so that gene
entry would be relatively asynchronous, and there would
also be complications due to PvuII gene expression in the
already established donor cells. With the M13-based
system, we could sensitively monitor the real-time the
kinetics of PvuII gene expression following fairly syn-
chronous introduction into new cells, and with much less
physiological disturbance of the recipients than with
transformation.
The choice of phage was also important. As opposed to
lyzing the host cell, M13 phage is continually released from
infected cells following assembly and extrusion through
the cell wall (43,59). M13 has been used successfully to
deliver antimicrobial agents in phage therapy trials (60,61).
Microarray analysis of M13-infected versus uninfected
E. coli (37) indicates a minimally disturbed transcriptional
response, even though growth rates of infected cells are
reduced (62) and such reduction itself can have substantial
eﬀects on gene expression (63,64). In addition, M13 DNA
enters the cell in single-stranded form (43). The PvuII genes
naturally reside on a mobilizable plasmid (4), and would
presumably enter new cells via conjugation in the form
of ssDNA (43). We therefore believe that the PvuII gene
expression patterns observed, following M13-mediated
entrance, reﬂect the responses of a relatively normal entry
into a physiologically relevant environment.
Several of our results with the M13-PvuII model system
are also consistent with its physiological relevance. First,
as with transformation-based systems, pre-expression of
the C protein leads to reduced plaquing eﬃciency by M13
phage that carries the PvuII R–M system (Figure 3A).
This result supports earlier inferences that pre-expressing
C proteins leads to lethally premature expression of the
linked REase gene (26,28), including the observation
that such ‘short circuiting’ was associated with DNA
damage (55,65,66). The second result supporting the
physiological relevance of this model system is the similar
expression kinetics of the MTase (pvuIIM) gene to that of
other constitutive genes (such as cat) introduced via M13
(compare Figures 2C and 4A). The third such observation
is that, at longer times after infection, the ratio of PvuII-
speciﬁc transcripts reaches the same value as in established
plasmid-borne PvuII genes (Figure 5B shows this for
pvuIIM and pvuIIR).
C.PvuII feedback-dependent delay of pvuIIR expression
R–M systems appear to undergo horizontal gene transfer
at a substantial rate (3,67). It has been proposed,
by inference from steady-state results, that (where present)
C proteins are responsible for temporal control of R–M
systems. This control was suggested to allow MTase
production and protection of host DNA before potentially
lethal REase activity appears (22,26,28). However, the
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 8 2589
proposed temporal control was never directly demon-
strated or measured.
Using bacteriophage M13 to introduce the PvuII genes
into a bacterial population, we showed here that a delay in
expression of PvuII REase (relative to that of the MTase)
actually occurs and is just <10min in length (under the
growth conditions used) (Figure 5A inset). This delay is
reﬂected in both quantitation of mRNAs and of enzyme
activity data (Figure 4). This implies, and our in vivo
methylation assays conﬁrm (Figure 4C and D), that
10min is enough time to protect the roughly 3000 PvuII
sites per average growing cell (51,52). Modiﬁcation would
have to be at least on one strand per site, though PvuII
REase can still cut hemimethylated sites (in vitro) at a low
rate (68). Presumably, selection for PvuII regulatory
mechanisms would not require complete protection, but
only a delay suﬃcient to limit the amount of damage to
the extent that it can be repaired (55,66,69) in a reasonably
high fraction of the new host cells.
To our knowledge, there has been no previous study of
expression kinetics in a type II R–M system. The type I
EcoK R–M system was studied kinetically (70,71), using
conjugation as the route of transfer. In that study,
restriction activity (from hsdR) appeared about 15 genera-
tions after transfer, while modiﬁcation activity (from hsdM,
hsdS) was detected almost immediately (70). The kinetics of
promoter activity for restriction (Pres) and modiﬁcation
(Pmod) subunits were also tested, and indicated simulta-
neous expression. This result indicates a major role for
posttranscriptional regulation for the EcoK R–M system
(71), now known to include controlled assembly/disassem-
bly, together with HsdR subunits that are degraded if
free (72), and phosphorylated only if complexed with
HsdMS (73). This regulatory approach may be less feasible
for type II systems, where unlike type I enzymes the REase
is active independently of the MTase (74).
The C.Pvu-dependent regulatory switch
The C-protein-dependent control systems of type II R–M
systems mediate regulatory decisions that mean life or
death to the host cell. In this respect, the type II R–M
systems resemble proteic toxin–antitoxin addiction sys-
tems (26), and the latter are often controlled by an
autogenous regulator (75). C.PvuII both activates and
represses transcription of its own gene, and both activities
are required for mobility and stability of a functional
(restricting) system (29). On the one hand, selectively
impairing the repression portion of C.PvuII action
signiﬁcantly reduces the eﬃciency of R–M system transfer
(by transformation) into new host cells (76). On the other
hand, no restriction activity appears in the absence of
functional C.PvuII (9,22,28), and this would presumably
also reduce the maintenance stability of the plasmid (26).
The roles of the C protein do not rule out additional
posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have
previously shown that the C and REase genes are on a
polycistronic mRNA (pvuIICR), with no evidence whatso-
ever for an independent pvuIIR promoter (24,28).
However, in this study we found that there is about
twice as much C segment as R segment mRNA
(Figure 1B). In nonpolar defective mutants of pvuIIC,
there is still signiﬁcantly (8) more pvuIIC than pvuIIR
mRNA (from the weak C-independent promoter).
This indicates that whatever is causing the apparent
attenuation of pvuIICR transcription does not depend on
the presence of active C protein.
The diﬀerence between pvuIIC and pvuIIR mRNA
levels does not appear to be due to diﬀerential stability.

Figure 5. Delayed expression of REase versus MTase. (A) The mRNAs for REase (red), MTase (blue) and C.PvuII (orange) were measured
following infection with M13 carrying wt pvuIIC as in ‘Materials and methods’ section. The data are from an experiment identical to that shown in
Figure 4A, but focusing on the initial time period. The inset shows the time between when pvuIIM and pvuIIR mRNA reach given fold increases; the
dotted double arrow in the main panel illustrates this delay at the 200-fold increased level. (B) Ratios of PvuII transcript levels (MTase/REase) over
time after infection. The dotted horizontal line indicates the ratio seen in the steady-state plasmid-borne wt PvuII R–M system (from Figure 1B). The
ave SE is 0.8 0.4 for points within 10min of infection, and 4.3 1.3 for the later points. The curve is not ﬁtted to the data, but shows the pattern
expected for an initial period of no diﬀerential expression (ratio=1.0) followed by a hyperbolic approach to the steady-state ratio.
2590 Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, No. 8
Post-rifampicin decay kinetics show two phases
(Figure 1C), but in both phases the pvuIIC-speciﬁc portion
of the pvuIICR transcripts is less stable than the pvuIIR
portion. This pattern, where the 50 portion of the
transcript is degraded more quickly than the 30 portion,
appears to be common in E. coli (77). Thus, the actual
drop in transcription rate between pvuIIC and pvuIIR
must be >2-fold (at least for an established system in
rapidly growing exponential cells). One possible explana-
tion for the rapid initial drop in post-rifampicin mRNA
levels might derive from the fact that the pvuIICR and
pvuIIM mRNAs are perfectly complementary to one
another at their 50 ends (for 32 or 66 nt, depending on
which pvuIIM promoter was used; see Figure 1A).
Hybridization would mutually and diﬀerentially aﬀect a
subset of the mRNAs in either of two ways. The duplexed
mRNAs might be more stable, due to protection of the 50
ends responsible for initiating decay (78), or less stable, as
is the case in many sRNA–mRNA interactions or when
translation initiation is blocked (79,80).
This study also revealed one interesting feature of
the C protein itself. An inactive variant of C.PvuII
(pvuIIC-Esp19), when pre-expressed prior entry of M13
carrying the wt PvuII genes, was able to reduce the EOP as
eﬃciently as wt C.PvuII (Figure 3A). The in-frame
insertion for that mutant adds a Leu codon to the
upstream helix of the helix–turn–helix motif (22), and
homodimers of this protein are defective for DNA binding
(28). The results shown in Figure 3A suggest that the
mixed heterodimers (of wt and Esp19) both bind DNA
and activate transcription. Activation by mutant/wt
heterodimeric regulatory proteins has been observed
previously (81), and the Esp19 mutation in pvuIIC is
well away from the subunit interface [based on alignment
to C.AhdI; see Figure 5 in (21)].
This model system should allow exploration of the
eﬀects of promoter, operator and activator/repressor
mutations on the temporal behavior of type II R–M
system, to better understand the process of their establish-
ment, and of toxin–antitoxin addiction modules in
general.
