ABSTRACT
HinP1I, a type II restriction endonuclease, recognizes
and cleaves a palindromic tetranucleotide sequence
(G#CGC) in double-stranded DNA, producing 2 nt 50
overhanging ends. Here, we report the structure of
HinP1I crystallized as one protein monomer in the
crystallographic asymmetric unit. HinP1I displays
an elongated shape, with a conserved catalytic core
domain containing an active-site motif of SDX18QXK
and a putative DNA-binding domain. Without signific-
ant sequence homology, HinP1I displays striking
structural similarity to MspI, an endonuclease
that cleaves a similar palindromic DNA sequence
(C#CGG) and binds to that sequence crystallograph-
ically as a monomer. Almost all the structural ele-
ments of MspI can be matched in HinP1I, including
both the DNA recognition and catalytic elements.
Examining the protein–protein interactions in the
crystal lattice, HinP1I could be dimerized through
two helices located on the opposite side of the protein
to the active site, generating a molecule with two act-
ive sites and two DNA-binding surfaces opposite one
another on the outer surfaces of the dimer. A possible
functional link between this unusual dimerization
mode and the tetrameric restriction enzymes is
discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Restriction endonucleases are ubiquitous among prokaryotes.
Their principal biological function is to protect the host gen-
ome against invading foreign DNA (1). The type II class of
restriction endonucleases forms the largest group with more
than 3600 members characterized to date (2). The majority of
type II enzymes recognize palindromic DNA sequences of 4–8
bp and, in the presence of Mg2+, cleave both strands of the
DNA within or close to the recognition sequence, producing
fragments with 50 phosphate and 30 hydroxyl ends (3).
Seventeen crystal structures for type II restriction enzymes
have been reported. All these structures share a catalytic archi-
tecture consisting of a b-sheet flanked by a helices (4). Con-
sistent with their usually symmetrical DNA recognition and
cleavage patterns, these enzymes were observed as dimers in
the crystal lattices, with one exception, MspI, which occurs as
a monomer (5). Dimerization results in a clamp-shaped
molecule, allowing the enzyme to wrap around the DNA
duplex and cleave the two DNA strands symmetrically and
simultaneously. Mutation studies have revealed that dimeriza-
tion is necessary for DNA cleavage (6). Interestingly, the
dimerization mode appears to correlate with the DNA cleav-
age pattern (7). Restriction enzymes that cleave DNA giving 50
overhangs, including EcoRI, BamHI, Bse634I, MunI, BstYI,
NgoMIV, BglII, BsoBI, FokI and Cfr10I, share strikingly sim-
ilar dimerization modes with four structurally equivalent a
helices within the core domain dominating the contacts at
the dimer interface (Figure 1A) (7–16). In contrast, the com-
mon dimerization feature of EcoRV, NaeI, PvuII and HincII
(17–20), enzymes that produce blunt ended DNA fragments, is
the intertwined contacts that are made by structural elements
protruding away from the protein core and crossing over the
neighboring subunit (Figure 1B). The BglI structure is the only
example of an enzyme that generates DNA fragments with 30
overhangs (21). Unlike the others, for the BglI–DNA complex,
there was only one protein subunit and one DNA strand in the
crystallographic asymmetric unit and thus the biologically
active homodimer was generated by the 2-fold crystallo-
graphic symmetry (Figure 1C). The first exception to the rule
of an endonuclease dimer came from the MspI structure (5).
An MspI monomer, not a dimer, binds to a palindromic DNA
sequence and makes specific (direct or water-mediated)
contacts with all 4 bp in the CCGG recognition sequence
(Figure 1D).
Here, we present the structure of HinP1I, at 2.65 A˚ resolu-
tion, which contains a monomer in the crystallographic

asymmetric unit. HinP1I is a type II restriction enzyme
from Haemophilus infuenzae P1 (22) that recognizes the
palindromic DNA sequence G#CGC and cleaves between
the first and second nucleotides, producing 2 nt 50 over-
hangs. Although it displays no significant sequence homo-
logy to any known endonuclease, HinP1I shares high
sequence identity with two hypothetical proteins from Hae-
mophilus somnus 2336 (identity 71%) and Helicobacter
pylori J99 (identity 54%). Here we show that,
structurally, HinP1I is strikingly similar to MspI (5).
The protein–protein interfaces in the HinP1I crystal lattice
were examined, and a potential functional link
between Hinp1I and the tetrameric restriction enzymes
was discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning
The genes for the HinP1I R-M system were cloned into
Escherichia coli by the ‘methylase-selection’ technique
(23,24). The DNA sequence of most of the larger PstI
fragment (23,24) was determined by a thermocycling pro-
cedure using the Circumvent Sequencing Kit (New England
Biolabs). A strategy of ‘primer-walking’ was employed,
using the sequence obtained in one round to design the
primer for the next. The primers, 14–16 bp in length and
spaced at intervals of 250 nt, were obtained from New
England Biolabs. The sequence of both DNA strands was
determined.

Purification
Aliquots containing 50 g E.coli RR1 carrying the cloned
HinP1I R-M system on two plasmids (R gene on pUC19 and
M gene on pACYC184) were resuspended in 200 ml Buffer
A (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 0.1
mM Na2EDTA and 5% glycerol) and disrupted by sonica-
tion for 4 · 5 min. Following centrifugation at 12 000 r.p.m.
for 45 min, the supernatant was applied to a 70 ml Heparin
Hyper D column, washed with 200 ml Buffer A, and a 600
ml gradient from 0 to 1.5 M NaCl in Buffer A was applied.
HinP1I eluted between 0.75 and 0.9 M NaCl. The pooled
fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A containing 50 mM
KPO4, pH 7.4, and applied in two separate runs to an 8 ml
Source S column. The column was washed with 16 ml
Buffer A and then eluted with 100 ml of a gradient from
0 to 1.0 M NaCl in Buffer A. HinP1I eluted between
0.275 and 0.325 M NaCl. Pooled fractions (20 ml) were
diluted with 62 ml Buffer B (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1
mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA and 5% glycerol) and applied
to an 8 ml Source Q column. Following a wash with 16 ml
Buffer B, the column was eluted with a gradient from 0 to
1.0 M NaCl in Buffer B. HinP1I eluted between 0.275
and 0.325 M NaCl, and the 7.5 ml pool was diluted with
15 ml Buffer A and applied in two separate runs to a 3 ml
Heparin TSK column. The column was washed with 6 ml
Buffer A and eluted with a 60 ml gradient from to 0 to
1.0 M NaCl. HinP1I eluted between 0.6 and 0.75 M
NaCl. The final yield of HinP1I in the pooled fractions
was 20 mg.
Crystallography
Native crystals of HinP1I were grown at 16C by the hang-
ing drop method. A 1 ml volume of 12 mg/ml protein in
0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) buffer was mixed with
1 ml of a well solution containing 6% PEG 4000, 0.2 M
Ammonium acetate, 100 mM MES, pH 5.5 and 1.2 M NaCl.
The mixture was then allowed to equilibrate over the well
solution.
Diffraction data were collected at Brookhaven National
Laboratory using beamlines X8C and X12C of the National
Synchrotron Light Source. Native crystals were briefly
soaked in 1 mM K2OsO4 solution, producing osmium
(Os)-derivative crystals. One Os-containing crystal was
used to collect data at peak wavelength. The native data
were collected to a better resolution (Table 1). The data
were subsequently reduced and scaled using the DENZO/
SCALEPACK (25).
Initial phases were obtained by single isomorphous
replacement using the anomalous scattering phasing
method. SOLVE (26) readily determined the single Os
site. The phases were then greatly improved by maximum
likelihood density modification using RESOLVE (27,28).
Owing to the good quality of the electron density map, RE-
SOLVE was able to auto-build 48% of the HinP1I model with
side chains and an additional 28% as main chain atoms. All
subsequent model rebuilding was performed using O (29).
Crystallographic refinement employed the program
CNS (30) against the native data set at 2.65 A˚ resolution
(Table 1).
RESULTS
Sequence analysis
Analysis of the sequence revealed two complete open reading
frames, ORF1 and ORF2, and the beginning of a third, all in the
same orientation. ORF1 encoded a 322 residue protein belong-
ing to the 5-methylcytosine family of DNA-methyltransferases
(m5C-MTases) that was shown to encode the M.HinP1I
methyltransferase. ORF2 encoded a 247 residue protein that
seemed likely to encode HinP1I. This assignment was con-
firmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the
purified HinP1I endonuclease. The first 22 residue of
HinP1I was found to be MNLVELGSKTAKDGFKNEK-
DIA . . . , exactly matching those coded at the start of ORF2.
The third, incomplete, ORF began 30 bp downstream of the
end of the hinP1IR gene, and traversed the PstI site, beyond
which no sequence was obtained. This ORF codes for the first
100 amino acids, or so, of the highly conserved enzyme valyl-
tRNA synthetase, and so it is likely to be the beginning of
the H.influenzae P1 valS gene. The HindIII R-M system of
H.influenzae Rd also occurs immediately upstream of the valS
gene (31) in the genome of that bacterium, and so the HinP1I
and HindIII systems might be considered allelic. The two
systems are entirely unrelated and so are unlikely to have
diverged from a common ancestor. They differ in recognition
sequence specificity (HindIII: AAGCTT; HinP1I: GCGC); in
gene organization (HindIII: R gene then M; HinP1I: M gene
then R); and in methyltransferase activity (M.HindIII: N6-
adenine MTase; M.HinP1I: 5-cytosine MTase). The amino
acid sequences of the HindIII and HinP1I endonucleases
are completely dissimilar, and so too are those of the methyl-
transferases (32). The proximity of both systems to the valS

gene would seem to be a coincidence, then, or a genetic
convenience, rather than a sign of common origin.
Overall structure
HinP1I comprises 247 amino acids, the first six N-terminal
residues of which are invisible in the electron density map.
In overall topology, HinP1I belongs to the a/b protein class,
with elongated dimensions of 68 · 33 · 32 A˚ (Figure 2A), and
contains two sets of b-sheets surrounded by eight a helices.
The upper b-sheet is a mixed six-stranded (b1-7-6-4-3-2) sheet
sandwiched by four a helices (aA and aB on one side,
and aH and aG on the other). The lower sheet contains

catalytic residues are shown in magenta color. The C-terminal b-hairpin, colored in red, contains the invariant residues (presumably involved in DNA base specific
interactions) between HinP1I and MspI. (B) Molecular surface representation, shown in the same orientation of (A). The surface is colored blue for positive, red for

five anti-parallel strands (b5-11-10-9-8), with the left side of
the sheet packing against five a helices (aC, aD, aE, aF and
aG) and the right side forming a concave basic surface, which
is the putative DNA-binding site (Figure 2B).
HinP1I shares striking structural similarity to MspI
As revealed by a Dali structure comparison (33), a pairwise
least squares superposition of HinP1I and MspI gives a root-
mean-square deviation of 3.1 A˚ over 195 Ca pairs (Z-score of
15.2). This close structural similarity is not evident at the
sequence level: guided by structural alignment, HinP1I
shows only 14% amino acid sequence identity (34 out of
247 residues) to MspI (Figure 3). Among the 34 identical
residues, 12 with hydrophobic side chains intercalate to
form the hydrophobic core of the molecule; 3 are catalytic
(E18, D62 and K83); 2 are potentially involved in specific
DNA contacts (Q236 and K238), and another 2 in DNA phos-
phate contacts (K60 and S86); 3 glycines (G7, G14 and G225)
might be structurally important for short turns; 2 charged
residues form an intra-molecular salt bridge (E154 and
R157); and 2 polar residues are involved in intra-molecular
hydrogen bonds (Q180 and N192). Seven additional conserved
charged residues of unknown function (K19, D23, K29, D46,
D109, R117 and R168) are scattered upon the surface of the
molecule (Figure 2B).
Almost all the structural elements of HinP1I can be matched
in MspI (Figure 2C), including both the DNA recognition
elements and the catalytic elements. This near-perfect
match allowed us to create a model of HinP1I bound to
DNA (Figure 2D). Using the coordinates for the complex
of MspI–DNA (see Figure 1D), we superimposed the protein
components and then positioned the DNA over the basic con-
cave surface. The resulting model showed that HinP1I could
contact the DNA without physical distortion of either the
protein or the DNA component. Besides an extra N-
terminal helix in MspI and an extra C-terminal helix in
HinP1I (Figure 3), the most obvious differences between
the two structures are helix aA, which is three helical turns
longer in MspI and inserts into the minor groove of DNA to
make water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the recognition
sequence, and the loop between helices aD and aE, which
is 13 residue longer in HinP1I and could adopt a closed
conformation upon association with DNA (Figure 2C).

respectively, above and below the aligned sequences. The amino acids highlighted are invariant (white letter against black background) and conserved (black against
cyan). The letters immediately above or below the sequences indicate the structural and suggested functional roles of the corresponding residues: ‘B’ indicates DNA
base interaction, ‘C’ indicates catalysis, ‘D’ indicates dimer interface, ‘H’ indicates hydrophobic core, ‘I’ indicates intra-molecule interaction, ‘P’ indicates DNA
phosphate interaction and ‘S’ indicates conserved surface residues (whose locations are shown in Figure 2B). The protein–DNA interactions involving main chain
atoms are not indicated.
1896 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 6
The shorter corresponding loop in MspI (residues D157–
K161) is involved in phosphate contacts outside of the recog-
nition sequence (Figure 4A).
HinP1I and MspI recognize similar 4 bp double-stranded
DNA sequences (G#CGC and C#CGG, respectively) and
cleave them in the same positions. MspI makes specific
contacts with all 8 nt within its recognition sequence (5),
one-half of the sequence being recognized mainly by direct
hydrogen bonds (5/6 interactions), and the other half mainly
by water-mediated hydrogen bonds (6/7 interactions)
(Figure 4A). Of the six residues in MspI that make direct
hydrogen bonds (S127, T248, S251, Q259, K261 and the
main chain carbonyl oxygen of Y249), four have equivalents
in HinP1I: Q221, Q236, K238 and the main chain carbonyl of
R222 (Figure 4B). These four residues are located in the
C-terminal hairpin strands b10 and b11. The loop between
these two strands, which is four residues longer in HinP1I than
in MspI, is flexible and characterized by high thermal factors,
but it might become ordered upon DNA binding, and posi-
tioned to make DNA contacts. Residues Q236 and K238 flank
the most highly conserved segment between HinP1I and MspI,
three consecutive invariant residues, QFK, present at the
extreme C-terminus of MspI (Figure 3). Two residues that
make phosphate contacts are also invariant: K97 in MspI
(K60 in HinP1I) that contacts the scissile phosphate and the
succeeding 50 phosphate; and S122 in MspI (S86 in HinP1I)
that contacts the second phosphate 30 to the scissile phosphate
(Figure 4A).
A common catalytic site motif among restriction enzymes is
characterized as PDXn(D/E)XK, the consensus residues of
which cluster around the scissile phosphate. The catalytic
residues of EcoRV, D74, D90 and K92 align spatially with
HinP1I residues D62, Q81 and K83, in which glutamine occurs
in place of the second acidic residue (Figure 4C). The catalytic
motif of HinP1I appears to be SDX18QXK, an unusual unique
feature that is also represented in MspI as TDX17NXK, in
which enzyme asparagine takes the place of the second acidic
residue (5). In addition, E18 of helix aA in HinP1I and E35 in
MspI are superimposable on E45 in EcoRV, and represent the
third acidic residue important for catalysis (34).
Unexpected dimerization mode in crystal lattice
Because HinP1I crystallized as a single protomer in the crys-
tallographic asymmetric unit and restriction endonucleases
that recognize symmetric DNA sequences generally are
thought to do so as homodimers, we examined all possible
protein–protein interfaces in the crystal lattice based on the
change in solvent accessible surface area (DASA) when going
from a monomeric to a dimeric state. The largest change in
DASA was found for a pair of the protomers related by a 2-fold
crystallographic axis of rotation through two helices (aF and
aG) located on the opposite side of the concave basic surface
(Figure 5A). These helices are arranged as a parallel four-helix
bundle at the dimer interface and participate in network of
hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic
contacts, and electrostatic interactions (Figure 5B). Involved

in this network are two arginines: R166 and R168. R168
interacts with E195; the corresponding residues in MspI are
R190 and D224, a conservative change. R166 interacts with
two residues, E174 in the loop following helix aF and N194 in
helix aG. Although the set of three residues in the E174–
R166–N194 interaction (E–R–N) is not present in MspI,
there is covariation that suggests a conserved interaction:
the side chains of T162 and R166 point out from the same
surface of helix aF (Figure 5B); the corresponding positions in
MspI are R184 and T188. Therefore, an arginine is present in
MspI at a position probably still maintaining the ion-pair
interaction (D202–R184–D223).
We consider this potential dimer interface to be significant;
approximately 1900 A˚2 of solvent-accessible surface is buried
by it (35). This area is comparable with those in other restric-
tion enzymes, which range from 800 to 4000 A˚2. If such a
dimer interaction does exist in solution, it positions the cata-
lytic sites and DNA-binding sites on opposite surfaces of the
dimer facing away from one another (Figure 5C), rather than
toward one another as occurs in all other endonuclease
homodimers that have characterized.
The functional significance of the crystal symmetry (CS)-
related HinP1I dimer (Figure 5C) is unclear, but it might
enable HinP1I to link in a back-to-back fashion similar to
that observed in tetrameric restriction enzymes, such as
Cfr10I, NgoMIV and Bse634I (Figure 5D) (10,12,16,36).
The tetrameric arrangement of these enzymes can be con-
sidered to be dimer–dimer interactions. The primary, face-
to-face, dimerization is similar to that of type II restriction
enzymes, such as EcoRI, enabling recognition of a symmetric
sequence and simultaneous double-strand DNA cleavage.
These primary dimers then position back-to-back to form a
tetramer, which binds to two copies of DNA. Kinetic studies
have shown that the tetrameric architecture is of functional
importance, and back-to-back dimer–dimer interaction is
required for effective DNA cleavage (10,36). Similar to these
tetrameric enzymes, HinP1I could also interact with two
recognition sites facilitated by its unique dimerization
mode. In addition, processing at these sites may be cooperat-
ive, and HinP1I may also require two recognition sites to be
present for effective catalysis.
Another possibility is that the dimeric form of HinP1I could
allow the formation of a large enzyme–substrate network with
high molecular weight DNA, such as demonstrated for
Serratia nuclease (37). Although the two subunits of Serratia
nuclease function independently of each other, they bind

simultaneously to a single macromolecular DNA, forming a
large network between the enzyme and the substrate. The CS-
mediated homodimeric HinP1I may serve the same function.
HinP1I occurs as a monomer in solution
While a monomer/dimer equilibrium was observed for MspI in
analytical ultracentrifuge experiments (5), we used several
alternative ways to establish whether HinP1I exists as a mono-
mer, dimer or tetramer in solution. First, gel filtration suggests
that HinP1I has an apparent molecular weight of a monomer.
On a Superdex75 column (Pharmacia), Hinp1I was loaded
onto the column at an initial concentration of 3.7 mg/ml
and eluted at an elution volume of 10.48, equivalent to a
28 kDa globular protein (Figure 6A). This is similar to the
calculated molecular weight of 28.75 kDa. Only at a loading
concentration of 75 mg/ml was a small fraction of HinP1I
eluted at a size close to that of a dimer at 59 kDa (Figure 6A).
Second, dynamic light scattering measurements at a con-
centration of 3.7 mg/ml, at temperatures of 4, 16 and 25C,
suggested that the hydrodynamic radius of HinP1I is 2.7–
2.8 nm, which would correspond to a 31–36 kDa globular
protein (Table 2). This dimension (2 · 2.8 = 5.6 nm) is between
the shorter (3.3 nm) and the longer (6.8 nm) dimensions
of the monomer (Figure 2). Interestingly, the size increased
as a function of protein concentration to 56 kDa (close to a
dimer at 8.0 mg/ml) and 183 kDa (close to a tetramer at 75
mg/ml).
Third, a portion of HinP1I formed a covalent dimer after
cross-linking by glutaraldehyde (Figure 6B). At higher con-
centrations of glutaraldehyde, a second band appeared at a
molecular weight close to tetramer. Taken together, these
data suggest that HinP1I occurs predominantly as a monomer
in solution, but can form a dimer or a higher order molecule
weight complex at high protein concentrations.
DISCUSSION
We do not know whether the solution properties of HinP1I are
dependent on the presence of substrate DNA, although, most
of the structurally characterized type II endonuclease–DNA
complexes comprise a protein dimer of identical subunits and a
single copy of a double-stranded oligonucleotide, with one
active site for each DNA strand. Certain type IIS enzymes,
such as FokI, dimerize transiently during catalysis (6,15,38)
and it seems reasonable to assume that HinP1I would, too. We
attempted to create a model of the HinP1I dimer bound to a
single copy of DNA. To prepare the model, we rotated the
HinP1I monomer (green) along the 2-fold symmetry of the
palindromic DNA and generated the second monomer
(magenta) with its active site for the other strand (Figure 7).
The most serious steric clash occurs between helices aC and
aD of one monomer and their 2-fold symmetry-related coun-
terparts of the other monomer. We imagine that upon associ-
ating with DNA, helices aC and aD could adopt a different
non-clashing conformation that would allow the formation of
an anti-parallel four-helix bundle in the dimer interface. In-
terestingly, helix aD contains two invariant residues between
HinP1I (D109 and R117) and MspI (D144 and R152) (see
Figures 3), whose positions are exposed on the monomer sur-
face (see Figure 2B), and which might therefore participate in
face-to-face dimerization much as such residues do in the
back-to-back dimerization discussed earlier.
Like FokI, BfiI is a type IIS endonuclease that forms a
homodimer as it makes double-strand breaks in DNA (39).
However, the BfiI homodimer, and its related Nuc enzyme
from Salmonella typhimurium (40), has only one active site

after loading 100 ml at 75 mg/ml concentration. (B) HinPI1 in the presence of
increasing amounts of glutaraldehyde. HinPI1 (1.9 mg/ml) was treated with
glutaraldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 1 h (total volume 20 ml).
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 ml of 1 M glycine. An aliquot of
15 ml of 3· loading buffer was added to these samples and subsequently 20 ml of
this final solution was loaded onto a 13% SDS–PAGE gel (Coomassie stain).

present at the dimer interface, and this single active site acts
sequentially on two DNA strands (41). Hence, it was proposed
that, after cutting one strand, a rearrangement of either the
protein and/or the DNA in the BfiI–DNA complex must switch
the active site to the other strand (41). HinP1I (and possibly its
structural homolog MspI) could in principle operate in the
same sequential way, binding to palindromic recognition
sequence as a monomer and cleaving first one DNA strand,
and then the other. If so, it could likely produce considerable
nicked intermediate, such as the monomeric mismatch repair
endonuclease MutH (42), for the introduction of a nick into the
target strand; however, we found it does not (G. G. Wilson,
unpublished data). On the other hand, HinP1I could cleave
DNA processively, i.e. repetitively continuing catalytic func-
tion without dissociating from the DNA. Clearly, further
biochemical and structural studies of HinP1I are warranted.
