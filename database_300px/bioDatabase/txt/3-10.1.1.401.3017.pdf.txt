Post-translational modification of proteins via the covalent attachment of Ubiquitin (Ub) plays an
important role in the regulation of protein stability and function in eukaryotic cells. In the present study,
we describe a novel method for identifying ubiquitinated proteins from a complex biological sample,
such as a whole cell lysate, using a combination of immunoaffinity purification and liquid chromatog-
raphy-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. We have demonstrated the applicability of
this approach by identifying 70 ubiquitinated proteins from the human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line
after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This method will aid the study of protein
ubiquitination and may be used as a tool for the discovery of novel biomarkers that are associated
with disease progression.

Introduction
Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small 8.5 kDa protein present in all
eukaryotes that participates in a host of critical cellular func-
tions by mediating the selective degradation of regulatory
proteins. The progression of the cell cycle,1 the heat shock
response,2 and antigen presentation,3 are among the many
processes regulated by Ub-dependent proteolysis. Not surpris-
ingly, aberrations in this pathway are implicated in the
pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer.4 Ubiquitina-
tion also regulates certain processes by mechanisms that,
although poorly understood, do not appear to involve pro-
teolysis. These include ribosomal function,5 DNA repair,6 and
the activation of protein kinases such as IB kinase.7
Post-translational attachment of Ub to a target protein
typically occurs via covalent attachment of its C-terminal
glycine to a lysine residue on the target protein by a multi-
enzymatic system consisting of activating (E1), conjugating (E2),
and ligating (E3) enzymes.8 Since Ub itself carries seven lysine
residues, this initial modification is often followed by the
glycine-lysine ligation of additional Ub molecules to the first
forming di-, tri-, tetra-, or poly-Ub chains. Recent evidence
suggests that for several proteins, initial covalent attachment
of Ub may occur via the amino group of the N-terminal
residue.9
Tetra- and poly-Ub chains serve as consensus signals for
protein degradation by the 26S proteasome, which is a multi-
subunit protease with activity specific for ubiquitinated pro-
teins. Within the lumen of the barrel-shapped proteasome, the
target protein is cleaved into peptides of 3-20 residues that
are further hydrolyzed to amino acids by cytosolic peptidases.10
The liberated poly-Ub chains are not degraded by the protea-
some, but are reused for modification of other proteins (see
Figure 1a).
Several types of low-molecular weight proteasome inhibitors
that can readily enter cells are commercially available. The most
widely used are peptide aldehydes, such as Cbz-leu-leu-leucinal
(or MG132) and Cbz-leu-leu-norvalinal (or MG115). These
agents are substrate analogues and act as potent transition-
state inhibitors.11,12 For example, the Ki of MG132 in vitro is a
few nanomolar and its IC50 is in the micromolar range for
inhibition of proteolysis in cultured cells.13
Enzymatic digestion of ubiquitinated proteins with trypsin
results in a signature peptide containing a di-glycine remnant
derived from the C-terminus of Ub that is covalently attached
to a lysine residue on the target protein.14,15 This signature
peptide has a mass addition of 114.1026 Da as well as a missed
cleavage site because trypsin is unable to cleave after the
modified lysine residue (see Figure 1b). Such a uniquely tagged
peptide provides a platform for the identification of ubiquiti-
nated proteins by mass spectrometry because the di-glycine
remnant is detected as a variable modification on lysine
residues after MS/MS sequencing and database searching.
Previous studies in yeast have shown that an affinity
purification step prior to MS/MS analysis offers significant
advantages for studying ubiquitinated proteins. Peng et al.
identified 72 Ub-protein conjugates from cells expressing 6 
His-Ub while Hitchcock et al. identified 211 membrane-
associated ubiquitinated proteins from cells expressing 6 His-
Myc-Ub.15,16 In both cases, large quantities of yeast were
cultured and epitope-tagged Ub conjugates were isolated. More
recently, Kirkpatrick et al. adapted this strategy to HEK293

embryonic kidney cells expressing 6 His-Ub-GFP. Results
from a series of experiments enabled the identification of 22
Ub-associated proteins, nearly half of which were identified
by a single peptide match.17
In the present study, we describe a novel method for
identifying ubiquitinated proteins using a combination of
immunoaffinity purification and LC-MS/MS analysis. Applica-
tion of this method enabled the confident identification of 70
ubiquitinated proteins from the human MCF-7 breast cancer
cell line after overnight treatment with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132. Proteins identified include Ub-ligating enzymes, sub-
units of the 26S proteasome complex, heat shock proteins,
transport proteins, DNA repair proteins, transcription and
translation elongation factors, and several proteins involved in
cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Our
findings represent the first proteomic analysis of native ubiq-
uitinated proteins from a genetically unmodified mammalian
cell line, and we expect our method to be adapted for the study
of other biologically relevant samples soon.
Materials and Methods
Antibodies and Reagents. The mouse monoclonal anti-Ub
antibody (clone FK2) was obtained from BIOMOL Inc. (Ply-
mouth Meeting, PA). Purified mouse IgG1 immunoglobulin
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Goat anti-
mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was obtained from
DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). MG132 was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. One mM stock solutions of MG132 were pre-
pared reconstituting in dimethyl sulfoxide. All other reagents,
unless specified, were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Burl-
ington, ON).
Cell Culture. Human MCF-7 breast epithelial cancer cells
were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM medium (GIBCO-
BRL, Burlington, ON) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.
After reaching 80% confluence, cells were treated overnight with
5-50 íM MG132 in DMEM medium. Cells were harvested,
washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and
resuspended in modified RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 1
mM EDTA) containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche
Diagnostics, Laval, QC). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min
at 14 000 rpm to pellet cell debris. Supernatants were collected
and protein concentration was assessed using a Bradford
protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Immunoaffinity Purification. Anti-Ub beads were prepared
by coupling 2 mg of anti-Ub Ab to 1 mL of protein G-agarose
beads (Roche) with dimethyl pimelimidate according to manu-
facturer’s instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 0.8  4 cm Poly-
Prep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) were then filled with
0.5 mL of anti-Ub beads. Prior to each purification, cell lysates
were pre-cleared with columns containing only protein G-
agarose beads for 10 min. at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysates containing
12.5 mg of total protein were then loaded onto immunoaffinity
purification columns and allowed to incubate for 2 h at 4 °C.
Columns were washed 10 with 5 mL of modified RIPA buffer.
Bound material was eluted with 2% SDS for 20 min at 37 °C.
Eluates from three successive purifications were pooled to-
gether and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-4 10 000 MWCO
centrifugal filter (Millipore, Nepean, ON). Five times sample
buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 40 mM Tris pH 6.8, 715 mM
â-mercaptoethanol when diluted to 1) was added to the
concentrated samples and proteins were separated on a 10%
SDS-PAGE gel and visualized with a Colloidal Coomassie
(Invitrogen).
LC-MS/MS. Protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gels
and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion as previously de-
scribed.18 Digestions were carried out for 8 h at 37 °C with
sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides
from each gel band were extracted, brought to a final volume
of 10 íL with 5% formic acid, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. An
Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA) was used to load peptides at 2 íL/min onto a 75 ím
 50 mm precolumn packed with 5 ím YMC ODS-A C18 beads
(Waters, Milford, MA). Following a desalting step, the flow was
split and peptides were eluted through a second 75 ím  50
mm column packed with the same beads at approximately 200
nL/min using a 5-80% gradient of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic
acid for 1 h. The LC effluent was electrosprayed into the
sampling orifice of a QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole-TOF mass
spectrometer (ABI/MDS Sciex, Concord, ON). MS/MS data was
then analyzed and matched to human protein sequences in
the MSDB database using the Mascot search engine. Peptide
and MS/MS mass tolerances were set at (100 ppm and 0.2
Da, respectively.
Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation. Proteins were
separated on NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris pre-cast gels (Invitrogen)
and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked
with 2% BSA (BioShop, Burlington, ON) overnight at 4 °C,
incubated with 1° Ab for 1 h at RT, washed 4 with 0.1%
Tween-20 in PBS for 5 min, and incubated with 2° Ab for 1 h
at RT. After another round of washing, bands were visualized
with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Oakville, ON) and
BioMax XAR imaging film (Kodak, New Haven, CT). For
immunoprecipitations, pre-cleared cell lysates were incubated
with 10 íL of anti-Ub beads (described above) for 2 h at 4 °C.
After washing 3 times with modified RIPA buffer, bound
material was eluted by heating the beads in 2 sample buffer
for 5 min at 95 °C.

Results and Discussion
Although many substrates of the Ub-proteasome pathway
have been individually characterized by biochemical and
genetic approaches,19,20 only a few large-scale studies of ubiq-
uitinated proteins have been reported primarily due to the
difficulties encountered in isolating these low-abundance
proteins using conventional purification methods. Several
groups have reported that when Ub is tagged at its N-terminus
with the Myc epitope or poly-Histidine, the isolation of Ub-
conjugates is greatly facilitated.21-23 Recently, Gygi and co-
workers have adapted this strategy for the purification of 6
His- and 6 His-Myc tagged Ub-conjugates from yeast cells
for mass spectrometry analysis.15,16
Epitope tagging strategies, however, are limited to cells that
have been genetically modified to express tagged Ub and it is
known that such molecules do not completely function as their
wild-type counterparts.21 In addition, many false positives are
likely to be obtained because expression levels of these
molecules may differ significantly compared to normal physi-
ological conditions. Furthermore, when Nickel (Ni)-affinity
chromatography is used to purify His-tagged Ub-conjugates,
numerous proteins containing multiple His residues in their
primary structure, or that have an alignment of His within their
secondary or tertiary structures, are co-purified nonselectively.
Identification of ubiquitinated proteins, whether in cell
lysates, tissues, or biological fluids, may enable the discovery
of relevant protein-based disease and drug biomarkers. This
is because degenerative diseases that destroy specific cells, or
diseases in which there is a certain level of necrosis, are known
to release ubiquitinated proteins into the blood.24 In addition,
drugs that induce apoptosis may also cause the accumulation
and release of ubiquitinated proteins into biological fluids.25
With this in mind, it was our goal to develop a novel proteomics
method for the analysis of native ubiquitinated proteins from
a complex biological sample (i.e., a human whole cell lysate)
using a combination of immunoaffinity purification, SDS-PAGE
separation, and LC-MS/MS analysis. For immunoaffinity
purification, a mouse monoclonal anti-Ub antibody (clone FK2)
that recognizes both mono- and poly-ubiquitinated species, but
not free Ub, would be employed. This antibody has been
successfully used to investigate the dynamics of Ub-conjugation
and for the development of immunoassays permitting the
quantification of intracellular and serum Ub chains.26-28 A
schematic representation of the method is outlined in Figure
2.
MCF-7 cells, which serve as a model system for breast cancer
cell transformation and proliferation,29,30 were treated overnight
with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to immunoaffinity
purification. Biochemical studies have shown that many regu-
latory proteins are degraded by the Ub-proteasome pathway
and because of their rapid degradation, such proteins are often
very hard to isolate.13 Therefore, their stabilization with pro-
teasome inhibitors is a valuable means to enhance cell content
and to facilitate their isolation from mammalian cells. As shown
Figure 2. Experimental method. (1) MCF7 cells were treated with MG132, or were left untreated. (2) Ubiquitinated proteins were isolated
by immunoaffinity purification. (3) Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Colloidal Coomassie. Gel bands were
excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. (4) Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. (5) MS/MS spectra were matched to human
protein sequences after database searching and were manually verified to confirm ubiquitination sites.

in the Western blot in Figure 3a, treatment of MCF-7 cells with
various concentrations of MG132 resulted in increased levels
of ubiquitination. A 5-íM concentration was determined to be
optimal based on the signal intensity strength and the number
of ubiquitinated species that were detected compared to the
untreated control. Concentrations above 50 íM were not
assessed due to the low survival rate of cells after overnight
treatment.
A series of small-scale immunoprecipitations was performed
using the anti-Ub antibody to confirm its ability to purify
ubiquitinated proteins from MCF-7 cells and to optimize a
number of conditions. This included the ratio of anti-Ub beads
for a given amount of starting material, the necessary incuba-
tion time to ensure strong antibody-antigen interactions, the
number of washing steps to eliminate the bulk of co-purifying
background proteins, and the most efficient type of elution
buffer. (Anti-Ub beads were prepared by covalently coupling
the anti-Ub antibody to Protein G-agarose beads (see Materials
and Methods).) The Western blot in Figure 3b, for example,
clearly shows that when 10 íL of anti-Ub beads was incubated
with increasing amounts of protein from MCF-7 cell lysates,
there was a proportional increase in the signal intensities of
the bands detected. This indicated that the anti-Ub beads
displayed specificity toward ubiquitinated proteins and enabled
the determination that 250 íg of protein per 10 íL of anti-Ub
beads was an optimal ratio that could be scaled-up for
subsequent purifications. This optimal ratio was deduced as
increasing the amount of protein up to 500 íg or above (data
not shown) did not result in increases in the intensities of the
bands.
To identify ubiquitinated proteins from MCF-7 cells, suf-
ficient amounts of material needed to be purified for LC-MS/
MS analysis. Initially, we attempted to pool material from
several immunoprecipitations for visualization on a SDS-PAGE
gel. Despite a considerable enrichment, as observed by Western
blotting, this proved to be inadequate (data not shown). The
pooling of multiple samples did little to improve the yield of
ubiquitinated proteins and only resulted in an increased
amount of nonspecific background. As a result, we decided to
employ a large-scale purification approach based on immu-
noaffinity chromatography to overcome these constraints. In
a recent study, such an approach enabled the successful
identification of several low-abundance protein complexes by
LC-MS/MS.31
Poly-Prep chromatography columns were filled with anti-
Ub beads and MCF-7 cell lysates were loaded and allowed to
incubate at 4 °C. Prior to loading, cell lysates were subjected
to a pre-clearing step by passing them through chromatography
columns containing only Protein-G agarose beads. After a 2 h
incubation period, which allowed sufficient time for ubiquiti-

nated proteins to bind with high-affinity to the anti-Ub beads,
a series of stringent washing steps was performed. Bound
material was then eluted with a solution containing a low
percentage of ionic detergent.
Eluates from three successive purifications were pooled,
concentrated, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (see Figure 4a).
Staining the gel with Colloidal Coomassie revealed that numer-
ous proteins from the two anti-Ub purifications (lanes 2 & 3)
were not present in the IgG isotype control (lane 1). Visual
inspection of the two anti-Ub purifications also revealed the
presence of additional proteins specific to MCF-7 cells that were
treated overnight with 5 íM MG132. A corresponding Western
blot analysis of 2% of the final eluates is shown in Figure 4b.
As expected, no ubiquitinated proteins were detected when the
mouse anti-IgG antibody was used for purification, thus
confirming the specificity of the anti-Ub antibody.
For the present study, it is necessary to point out that it was
not our intention to perform a comparative or differential
analysis of ubiquitinated proteins from MG132-treated and

untreated MCF-7 cells. Instead, it was our goal to develop a
method for the analysis of ubiquitinated proteins and to
validate it using a biologically relevant sample. An important
conclusion that can be drawn from a qualitative/visual inspec-
tion of the results shown in Figure 4a,b is that application of
our immunoaffinity purification protocol will result in the
isolation of additional target proteins when there is an increase
in the level of ubiquitination in a given sample (e.g., after
MG132 treatment). Currently, we are developing a gel-free
protocol for the differential analysis of multiple samples using
LC-MS/MS, and a commercially available mass spectrometry
software package. In this way, we will be able to quantitatively
monitor the expression levels of ubiquitinated proteins before
and after drug treatment.
Thirty bands were excised from the MG132-treated lane
shown in Figure 4a and were subjected to in-gel tryptic
digestion. Peptides were extracted, separated by nanoflow LC,
and then introduced into a quadrupole-TOF mass spectrom-
eter. MS/MS analysis and database searching resulted in the
identification of 70 proteins, each matching with 2 or more
unique peptide sequences. Identification of signature peptides
(see Figure 1b) was made possible by selecting a ubiquitinated
lysine residue with a monoisotopic mass of 242.13788 Da in
the Mascot variable modification list prior to database search-
ing. This mass corresponds to a lysine residue with an attached
di-glycine moiety derived from Ub (128.09496 Da + 114.04292
Da).32 A complete list of the ubiquitinated proteins identified
with their corresponding Mascot scores is found in Table 1.
Representative MS/MS spectra of three signature peptides
are shown Figure 5a-c. Doubly charged [M + 2H]+ peptide
ions at m/z 698.3 (a), 730.9 (b), and 401.2 (c) were fragmented
via collision-induced dissociation. The masses of the fragments
were measured and the peptide sequences MQIFVKGGTLTGK,
LIFAGKGGQLEDGR, and EGKGGLLK, all of which contain an
internal lysine with a di-glycine remnant that is derived from
Ub, were obtained. Subsequent database searching matched

these peptide sequences to proteins found in bands 5, 12, and
24. In all cases, signature peptides were manually verified to
confirm protein ubiquitination.
The two bands present in the IgG control lane in Figure 4a,
with molecular weights of approximately 50 kDa and 40 kDa,
were also subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis and database
searching. This resulted in the identification of Tubulin and
Actin isoforms as co-purifying background proteins (see Table
2). As a result, they were removed from consideration as
ubiquitinated proteins. Tubulin and Actin have also been
reported as commonly observed contaminants with other
affinity purifications using agarose and sepharose-based res-
ins.33,34 Recently, isoforms of each were reported as nonspecific
proteins when Ni-NTA-agarose beads were used for the
isolation His-tagged GFP-Ub conjugates from HEK293 cells.17
Among the proteins listed in Table 1 are the E3 and EDD
ubiquitin protein ligases, both of which were identified from
band 2 with Mascot scores of 769 and 201, respectively (the
statistically significant threshold score was 38). These enzymes
are attached to Ub within cells and act as readily accessible
storage pools of Ub. Also identified were Poly-Ub and a protein
containing multiple Ub-like sequences (FLJ32377). Interestingly,
both proteins have theoretical molecular weights well below
the apparent molecular weight of band 2. Therefore, it is likely
that they comigrated with either of the two Ub-ligating enzymes
and were still covalently attached due to incomplete tryptic
digestion. A similar explanation is likely for all of the bands
that were found to contain Poly-Ub and/or Ub.
Numerous proteins belonging to the 26S proteasome com-
plex are listed in Table 1, including 6 ATPase and 3 non-ATPase
regulatory subunits. Each subunit is known to interact with a
number of related regulatory proteins as well as a distinct
subset of cytosolic, nuclear, and/or membrane proteins that
are known to be ubiquitinated. For example, the 26S protea-
some non-ATPase regulatory subunit 2, identified from Band
9 with a Mascot score of 707, is known to directly bind to
ATPase regulatory subunits 1 and 2, non-ATPase regulatory
subunit 5, the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, and the intracellular
domain of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-type 1 receptor.35-37
Eleven members of the heat-shock protein family and three
members of chaperonin protein family were identified from
bands 11, 13, and 15-19. This was not surprising as the heat
shock response is known to be directly regulated through the
Ub-proteasome pathway. By tagging and degrading unfolded
or damaged proteins, the Ub-proteasome pathway helps to
prevent the accumulation of heat shock proteins under normal
conditions.13 However, when this degradative process is blocked
by a proteasome inhibitor such as MG132, there is an induction
of heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones (e.g., BiP and
glucose-regulated stress proteins) which will in turn bind to
Ub and Ub-tagged proteins.38,39
All other ubiquitinated proteins that were identified are listed
in Table 1. This includes thirteen metabolic enzymes, eight
DNA repair proteins, five cell cycle and apoptosis-related
proteins, five proteins involved in signal transduction, four
transcription and translation elongation factors, four transport
proteins, four structural proteins, and two hypothetical proteins
with currently unknown functions. A pie-chart distribution of
these proteins into different functional categories is shown in
Figure 6. As expected, the diversity of proteins identified in this
study confirms that the important role that ubiquitination plays
in the regulation of many key cellular functions in MCF-7 cells.
Conclusion
Taken together, our findings represent the first proteomic
analysis of native ubiquitinated proteins from a genetically
unmodified/untransfected mammalian cell line. Our method
was shown to enable the profiling of ubiquitinated proteins
from human MCF-7 cells under normal physiological condi-
tions and/or after drug treatment. Further work is underway
to improve the sensitivity of the method in order to permit the
identification of very low-abundance ubiquitinated proteins
which may serve as biomarkers of disease progression or as
targets of novel therapeutics that interfere with the Ub-
proteasome pathway. We expect our method to soon be
adapted for the study of ubiquitinated proteins in other
complex biological material, including human serum and
plasma samples.
