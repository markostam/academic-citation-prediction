ABSTRACT
The molecular basis of drug action is often not
well understood. This is partly because the very
abundant and diverse information generated in the
past decades on drugs is hidden in millions of
medical articles or textbooks. Therefore, we develo-
ped a one-stop data warehouse, SuperTarget that
integrates drug-related information about medical
indication areas, adverse drug effects, drug meta-
bolization, pathways and Gene Ontology terms of
the target proteins. An easy-to-use query interface
enables the user to pose complex queries, for
example to find drugs that target a certain pathway,
interacting drugs that are metabolized by the same
cytochrome P450 or drugs that target the
same protein but are metabolized by different
enzymes. Furthermore, we provide tools for 2D
drug screening and sequence comparison of the
targets. The database contains more than 2500
target proteins, which are annotated with about
7300 relations to 1500 drugs; the vast majority of
entries have pointers to the respective literature
source. A subset of these drugs has been annotated
with additional binding information and indirect
interactions and is available as a separate resource
called Matador. SuperTarget and Matador are
available at http://insilico.charite.de/supertarget
and http://matador.embl.de
INTRODUCTION
Within the past two decades our knowledge about
drugs, their mechanisms of action and target proteins
has increased rapidly. Nevertheless, knowledge on their
molecular eﬀects is far from complete. For some drugs
even the primary targets are still unknown, for example,
Diloxanide, Niclosamide and Ambroxol are administered
successfully although their eﬀect on human metabolism is
still not clariﬁed at a molecular level (1). Even if the
medical eﬀect has been explained by a certain molecular
interaction, most drugs interact with several additional
targets, which may either strengthen the therapeutic
eﬀect or cause unwanted adverse drug eﬀects (2).
Moreover, our knowledge on drugs and their targets is
highly fragmented, most of it residing in millions of
medical articles and textbooks, which precludes systematic
studies.
Several databases exist that collect binding data
on small molecules, in particular drugs and proteins.
The largest such resource is DrugBank (3), which contains
2600 drug-target relations for 900 FDA-approved drugs
and additional annotations for 3200 experimental drugs.
Another notable database is the Therapeutic Target
Database (TTD) (4), which holds target information on
about 1000 small molecule drugs. Unfortunately,
DrugBank only provides references on the target,
although generally not on the interactions, which makes
it diﬃcult to obtain information on the experimental
context under which an interaction was observed.
Moreover, the drugs in the TTD are not cross-linked

with compound databases such as PubChem, ChemDB
or the commercial CAS Registry, and the targets are
not linked to protein databases such as UniProt or PDB.
This makes it diﬃcult to retrieve information such as
the chemical structure of the drug, its physiochemical
properties, the sequence or 3D structure of its target or
the biological pathways that it aﬀects.
In order to be able to derive further information
about drug-target relations, we have developed a one-
stop data warehouse, SuperTarget that provides this
functionality and integrates drug-target relations from
diﬀerent resources using heterogeneous retrieval methods.
We consider a drug-target relation as a speciﬁc interaction
of a small chemical compound administered to treat or
diagnose a disease and a macromolecule, namely protein,
DNA or RNA. The ﬁrst release of SuperTarget contains
a core dataset of about 7300 drug-target relations of which
4900 interactions have been subjected to a more extensive
manual annotation eﬀort to incorporate additional
binding information as well as indirect interactions.
The resulting data on 775 drugs is provided separately
as Matador (Manually Annotated Targets And Drugs
Online Resource).
DRUG-TARGET RELATIONSHIPS
Drug-target relationships described in SuperTarget
were obtained in three diﬀerent ways. Starting with 2400
drugs and their synonyms from the SuperDrug Database
(5), the text mining tool EbiMed (6) was used to extract
relevant text passages containing potential drug-target
relations from about 15 millions public abstracts listed
in PubMed. Many thousands of false positive or irrelevant
relations were eliminated by manual curation.
In parallel, potential drug-target relations were auto-
matically extracted from Medline by searching for syno-
nyms of drugs, proteins and Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH terms) describing groups of proteins (7). MeSH
terms were used to capture and down-weight interactions
that are not explicitly described in the abstracts e.g. for
protein families or protein complexes. In the case of
families, the speciﬁc interacting family member might not
be known yet, whereas in the case of complexes, the drug
might interact with more than one subunit. Proteins
associated to MeSH terms were assigned by a semi-
automated procedure relying on mappings provided by
MeSH and synonyms of proteins that are aggregated
in the STRING resource (8). Proteins that were often
mentioned in abstracts, but could not be automatically
assigned to families, were manually assigned. Depending
on the size and nature of the families, the conﬁdence of
an interaction between drugs and individual proteins
was decreased. More heterogeneous families are assigned
a lower conﬁdence. The most probable candidates
were identiﬁed using a benchmarking scheme (8) and
manually curated.
In a last step, relations from other databases, namely
DrugBank (3), KEGG (9), PDB (10), SuperLigands
(11) and TTD (4), were checked for drug-target
interactions not identiﬁed with the preceding steps.
If those interactions could be conﬁrmed by literature
listed in PubMed, the references were included in
SuperTarget otherwise the describing database is
referenced.
In consideration of the large number of entries we
cannot rule out that some of the data is erroneous,
change over time or is too unspeciﬁc. In the case of doubt
we refer to the referenced relation source.
To be able to obtain more information on the
drug-target relations, SuperTarget provides links to phy-
sicochemical properties and further structural information
of drugs. Proven or potential target proteins are repre-
sented by sequences as stored in UniProt (12), by func-
tional annotations extracted fromGOA (13) and by related
pathway information provided by KEGG (9) (compare
Figure 1). Adverse drug reactions were extracted from the
free accessible Canadian Adverse Reaction Monitoring
Program (CADRMP, http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/).
For a subset of the drug-target relations, namely those
where our text-mining approach indicated a wealth of
additional information, the type of binding was further
analyzed and direct and indirect interactions were
manually distinguished. Indirect interactions can, for
example, be caused by active metabolites of the drug or
by changes in the expression of a protein. The extensively
annotated subset, which is contained in Matador should
be well-suited as training set for various large-scale
discovery approaches.
ANALYSIS OPTIONS IN SUPERTARGET
The integration of drug related information provides
numerous diﬀerent query entry points as well as global
surveys on complex topics using heterogeneous data
types (for an illustration of query capabilities see
Figure 2).
Since compounds with high structural similarity
frequently exhibit similar activities (14), all drugs with
comparable structural ﬁngerprints are made accessible.
Figure 1. System architecture and number of database entries of
SuperTarget. The database contains the complete Uniprot with more
than 3 million entries. Beside the targets, drugs and pathways the
database provides 23 000 diﬀerent GO-terms and 30 000 links to protein
structures.

Fingerprints allow a fast identiﬁcation of drugs with very
similar physiochemical properties that may interact with
the same target molecules. Structural similarity scores and
ﬁngerprints are computed with the open-source Chemistry
Development Kit (15).
Analogously, similar proteins are quickly identiﬁable by
precomputed sequence alignments provided by SIMAP
(16). Proteins homologous to annotated target proteins
are candidates for interacting with the drug and may
explain adverse eﬀects of drugs.
Drug metabolizing enzymes come into question to
explain adverse drug responses. Genetic polymorphism of
cytochrome P450 genes or associated regulatory
factors may lead to diverse ability of drug degradation
(17). The web interface provides an extra section to
retrieve the cytochrome interaction data for most of the
annotated drugs.
Drugs are classiﬁed in the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical Classiﬁcation System (ATC). This hierarchical
classiﬁcation system was introduced by the World
Health Organization in 1990, classifying drugs according
to their medical indications and chemical scaﬀold. Groups
of drugs can be selected by their ATC code. A searchable,
hierarchical ATC-tree enables a fast detection of drug
classes and medical indications like, for example, ‘anti-
Parkinson drugs’ by expanding the branch ‘nervous
system’.
The integration of Gene Ontology (GO) terms in
SuperTarget enables complex queries like ‘Are there
anti-cancer drugs that induce apoptosis and are associated
with transcription factors?’ which can be answered by
combined selection of apoptosis in the pathway tab
and transcriptional activator activity in the ontology tree.
To facilitate the analysis, targets or drugs can be
collected and stored in a clipboard. A session can be saved
on the server and restored up to 30 days later. Each object
of the clipboard links to a window with object-related
information. Depending of the object type, the window
contains additional information relating to drugs, targets,
pathways, GO terms or metabolization. A further
hyperlink leads to the search history.
CONCLUSIONS AD FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although the ﬁrst version of SuperTarget with all the
search and discovery tools around drug-target relations
is already an extensive resource for both large-scale
research and in depth analysis, the captured knowledge
is still far from complete and we would like to invite
the community to help in increasing quality and quantity
of the records. SuperTarget oﬀers an option to upload
and incorporate drug-target relations into a working
queue. Uploaded entries will be reviewed and approved
by an annotation team comprised of graduated
scientists. Both SuperTarget and Matador can be used
as knowledge sources, discovery tools or training sets
for various applications in chemical biology and
elsewhere.

Figure 2. Example of a complex query: search for an alternative
drug to Taxol, which adresses the same target Bcl-2, but is not
metabolized by the cytochrome 2C8. Procedure: start to search for
the targets and the metabolizing cytochromes of Taxol in the associated
categories. The resulting lists contain among others the target Bcl-2
as well as the P450 cytochrome 2C8. Second, forward 2C8 and Bcl-2
into the query term box, combine them using the ‘NOT’ operator
and submit the query. The resulting drug list contains two alternative
drug candidates for Taxol (Docetaxel and Flupirtine).
