ABSTRACT
ProTherm and ProNIT are two thermodynamic data-
bases that contain experimentally determined ther-
15 modynamic parameters of protein stability and
protein–nucleic acid interactions, respectively. The
current versions of both the databases have consid-
erably increased the total number of entries and
enhanced search interface with added new fields,
20 improved search, display and sorting options. As
on September 2005, ProTherm release 5.0 contains
17 113 entries from 771 proteins, retrieved from
1497 scientific articles (20% increase in data from
the previous version). ProNIT release 2.0 contains
25 4900 entries from 273 research articles, representing
158 proteins. Both databases can be queried using
WWW interfaces. Both quick search and advanced
search are provided on this web page to facilitate
easy retrieval and display of the data from these
30 databases. ProTherm is freely available online
at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/Protherm/
protherm.html and ProNIT at http://gibk26.bse.

INTRODUCTION
35 Thermodynamic database for proteins and mutants (Pro-
Therm) and thermodynamic database for protein–nucleic
acid interactions (ProNIT) are two comprehensive, integrated
databases that document experimentally determined thermo-
dynamic parameters published in the literature. Both ProTherm
40 (1–4) and ProNIT (5) include several thermodynamic
parameters along with sequence and structural information,
experimental methods and conditions, and literature informa-
tion. Recent years have seen tremendous progress in studies
on proteins owing to the development of various experimental
45methods to analyze proteins at the genome scale. The correla-
tion between structure and thermodynamics of these key
molecules provides valuable insights into the way in which
they function. Even though the information is available in
scientific journals, books (6,7) and literature databases,
50retrieving useful, specific data from these resources is time
consuming and laborious. Our major goal in developing these
databases is to provide the scientific community a single,
comprehensive data repository, where all the thermodynamic
data related to protein stability and protein–nucleic acid
55interactions are available. The availability of such thermodyn-
amic databases would be a valuable resource for understand-
ing the protein folding mechanism, protein stability, molecular
recognition and gene expressions. This can lead to a wide
spectrum of applications such as developing algorithms/
60methods for prediction systems, protein engineering and
quantitative simulation of gene regulatory networks. The ther-
modynamic data available in ProTherm and ProNIT are
widely used by researchers to study the underlying mechan-
isms of protein stability upon mutations and protein–nucleic
65acid interactions (see the reference sections on both the web-
sites). This paper describes the major updates and enhance-
ments to these databases for the last few years.

Previous publications (1–5) explain in detail the content and
organization of the databases. Table 1 summarizes the contents
of ProTherm and ProNIT. ProTherm and ProNIT are imple-
mented in 3DinSight (8), a relational database system for
5 structure, function and property of biomolecules. This facil-
itates more efficient search and retrieval of data by flexible
queries, and enables users to gain insight into the relationship
among structure, thermodynamics and function of proteins.
We have been collecting the thermodynamic data from pub-
10 lished original articles, by searching the PubMed literature
database with a combination of specific terms, as well as
by searching online journals probably containing thermodyn-
amic data. The database does not contain any predicted or
computational interaction data. Researchers then extract the
15 relevant data from the selected articles. The input data are
checked automatically by checking programs and also manu-
ally to avoid errors. Then, we upload the data first to a test site,
where expert curators check and verify the data. After this
checking, we upload the data to the public site for users.
20 Furthermore, an email notification for each input entry is sent
to the corresponding author, which enables the authors to
check their own data and thereby improve the data validation.
DATABASE STATISTICS
We update both the databases frequently. The current release,
25 ProTherm 5.0 contains 17 113 entries from 771 proteins,
retrieved from 1497 scientific articles, which is20% increase
in data from the last version (4). Currently, the numbers of data
for wild-type proteins, single, double and multiple mutants are
7014, 8202, 1277 and 620, respectively. Based on the solvent
30accessibility of mutants, 4426 mutations are buried, 2687 par-
tially buried and 2751 exposed. In terms of secondary struc-
tures, 3993 mutations are in helix, 2622 in strand, 1227 in turn
and 2467 in coil regions. Majority of data are obtained from
CD (6825) and DSC (5294) experiments followed by fluores-
35cence (3628). Further, 10 154 data are obtained by thermal
denaturation, 3890 and 2796 data from GdnHCl and urea
denaturation, respectively.
Currently, ProNIT 2.0 contains 4900 entries from 273
research papers. There are 158 different DNA-binding pro-
40teins with 3489 wild-type entries and 1411 mutant entries.
Majority of data are obtained by gel shift (1316), fluorescence
(1143) and filter binding (1053), followed by calorimetry
(727), surface plasmon resonance (185) and footprinting
(168). Although proteins from a variety of organisms are
45present in ProNIT, majority of interaction data are from
Escherichia coli proteins (1625) followed by Mus musculus
(637) and Homo sapiens (569).
NEW FEATURES
There is a growing interest in the relationship between struc-
50ture and thermodynamics of proteins. Thus, we try to provide
link from thermodynamic data in ProTherm to structural
information. So far, ProTherm data are connected to sequence
and structural information of proteins through 3DinSight. We
have added a new cross-link between ProTherm and STING
55(9), a comprehensive analysis tool for proteins with many
structural descriptors. For given protein mutations searched
within STING, each entry in STING report is connected to
available thermodynamic data in ProTherm. Conversely, all
the ProTherm data with available protein structure have
60pointers to the corresponding STING entry with detailed struc-
tural information. This cross-link will greatly facilitate the
analysis of structure–thermodynamic relationship of proteins.
The ProTherm page also provides cross-reference tables
necessary for creating cross-links with PDB (10), PIR (11)
65and Swiss-Prot (12) databases. We have also added several
new features in the search interface to make the search more
efficient and convenient.
In the current release of ProNIT 2.0, we have included200
protein–RNA interaction data. To facilitate the retrieval of
70data based on DNA and RNA separately, we have added a
new field called TYPE_NUC, where we provide the informa-
tion about whether the nucleic acid sequence is DNA (single-
stranded DNA, ssDNA, or double-stranded DNA, dsDNA) or
RNA. Furthermore, a search option is added to retrieve data
75based on ssDNA, dsDNA or RNA. The protein nomenclature
in the literature is not necessarily uniform. Hence, we have
added a new field, SYNONYMS, in order to address this
problem. Other additions of field are the SwissProt ID of
the protein and ‘RELATED_ENTRIES’, which provides the
80list of entries that contain data from the same paper (the ori-
ginal paper usually contains multiple data and they are entered
in different entries). We also provide a link to all homologous
PDB codes with sequence identity of >95%. Also, display
