[1] Convective clouds on Titanmay play an important role in
climate dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, and the overall
volatile cycle. To study the formation and evolution of these
clouds, we have developed the Titan Regional Atmospheric
Modeling System (TRAMS). TRAMS is a three-dimensional,
time-dependent, coupled fully compressible dynamic and
microphysical model capable of simulating methane and
ethane clouds in Titan’s atmosphere. In initial model tests over
a two-dimensional domain, a warm bubble or random
temperature perturbations trigger a parcel of air to rise. For
an initial methane profile with a 60% surface humidity,
convection occurs for positive temperature perturbations of
1 K or greater. Cloud tops are between 25 and 35 km,
consistent with observations of the south polar clouds. For a
drier methane environment in the lower atmosphere,
characteristic of the Huygens landing site, convection does
not occur, but a layer of stratiform clouds is able to form at
altitudes around 10 km. Citation: Barth, E. L., and S. C. R.

1. Introduction
[2] Titan’s polar clouds have been a prominent feature in
the southern hemisphere for a number of years. Clouds were
initially detected through brightness changes across Titan’s
disk [Griffith et al., 1998, 2000] and later, with improvements
in adaptive optics, imaged through ground-based observing
[Roe et al., 2002; Brown et al., 2002]. The Cassini spacecraft
and long-term ground-based observations [Schaller et al.,
2006] have shown a recent drop in occurrence of these south
pole clouds, possibly linked to seasonal changes.
[3] Griffith et al. [2000] argued the clouds they detected
were convective in nature due to rapid lifetimes (hours) and
common heights (25 km). For convective clouds to form,
a parcel of moist air must rise until reaching saturation at the
lifting condensation level (LCL). Further upward forcing
of the parcel results in condensation and latent heat release
and the parcel will cool at the saturated adiabatic lapse rate.
If the environmental lapse rate exceeds the saturated
adiabatic lapse rate, and the parcel continues to rise, it will
reach a level at which it becomes buoyant relative to its
surroundings, the level of free convection (LFC). The parcel
can then freely accelerate upwards. Griffith et al. [2000]
looked into the stability of Titan’s atmosphere and found an
LCL of 2 km and an LFC of 5.5 km for a humidity of 60%
at the surface; the LFC is lowered to 2 km for a parcel at
80% humidity.
[4] Awal and Lunine [1994] focused on local convective
processes; Voyager only saw the lapse rate in two locations,
hence a low probability of being in the region of localized
vigorous convection. For surface methane volume mixing
ratios within Voyager data error bars (3–7%), they found
the areal coverage of moist plumes to be at most 105, but
more likely 107. Plume velocities resulting in moist
convection were 1–10 m/s depending on surface methane
and the environment relative humidity at the parcel’s
saturation point.
[5] A recent convection model by Hueso and Sa´nchez-
Lavega [2006] also found strong updrafts of 1–20 m/s are
necessary to initiate convection. They developed a 3-D
methane convection model to characterize the amount of
precipitation produced by storms (composed of methane
droplets) at Titan’s South Pole. For methane humidities in
the troposphere greater than 80%, they could produce
vigorous methane storms which dissipated in 5–8 hrs and
left behind more than 100 kg/m2 of methane rainfall on the
surface.
[6] There are a number of differences between our model
and that of Hueso and Sa´nchez-Lavega [2006]. They
employ a different dynamical core which uses the anelastic
approximation to the continuity equation. Our model is fully
compressible; also we include additional microphysical
processes such as nucleation, freezing and melting and a
more rigorous treatment of the coalescence of cloud par-
ticles as described in Section 2. Nevertheless, we include
some comparisons between our model results and theirs in
Section 3.
2. Modeling
[7] The Regional Atmospheric Modeling System
(RAMS) was developed at Colorado State University in
the mid-1980s. The model is a fusion of several terrestrial
weather simulation codes [Mahrer and Pielke, 1977; Tripoli
and Cotton, 1982; Tremback and Kessler, 1985; Pielke et
al., 1992] and has been successfully adapted to study the
weather on Mars [Rafkin et al., 2001]. RAMS is a fully
compressible non-hydrostatic model, which permits the
simulation of atmospheric flows with large vertical accel-
erations, such as convective clouds. The model is three-
dimensional, time-dependent, and easily configured over a
wide range of user-specified horizontal grid spacings that
can range from meters to hundreds of kilometers. The
vertical coordinate is a terrain-influenced sigma system that
may be geometrically stretched with height to provide
highest resolution in the boundary layer.
[8] A coupled dynamic and microphysics model, Titan-
RAMS (TRAMS), was adapted from RAMS to simulate
clouds on Titan. We run the model in 2-D, with 55 to 60
vertical layers up to 50 km and 200 to 400 horizontal layers
of 1 km spacing. Vertical grid spacing is 10 s of meters near

the surface up to 2 km layers aloft. The microphysics
includes processes for haze particles (coagulation, sedimen-
tation) and cloud particles (nucleation, condensation, coa-
lescence, sedimentation, evaporation), for a number of size
bins. Barth and Toon [2003, 2006] describes the equations
governing the microphysics package.
[9] The haze particles range in size from 13 A˚ to 3.35 mm
(bin-center radius). Cloud particles overlap the haze popu-
lation at 0.04 mm and extend to 5 mm size; droplets growing
any larger would be subject to breakup. The number of bins
for each particle type depends on the mass ratio between
bins; simulations reported here use a ratio of 8.
[10] The model is initialized uniformly in the x-direction
from the temperature/density profiles of Lellouch and
Hunten [1987]. Haze particles are initialized and added
with a flux at the top boundary following [Barth and Toon,
2003]. Several methane profiles are explored, including
[Lellouch et al., 1989], the Huygens landing site sounding
[Niemann et al., 2005], combinations of the two, and cases
with higher surface humidities. Figure 1 shows two simu-
lated ‘‘soundings’’ on a skew T log P thermodynamic
diagram. Soundings are commonly used to determine at-
mospheric stability with respect to moist convection and
cloud properties in a given environment. Unsaturated par-
cels follow an adiabat and constant (CH4-N2) mixing ratio
line. Once saturated, the parcel follows the moist adiabat.
Stability is determined by comparing parcel temperature to
that of the environment at any given level. In each plotted
sounding, a parcel at the surface is unsaturated and colder
than the environment when initially lifted. Forced lifting
allows for condensation at the lifting condensation level
(LCL). With further forced lifting, the parcel becomes
warmer than the environment at the level of free convection
(LFC). The total integrated temperature difference (area
between the parcel and environment temperature curves)
is the convective available potential energy (CAPE). A
trigger is needed to provide energy for the parcel to reach
the LFC. For the Lellouch case, the LCL is close in altitude
to the LFC (LCL at 2.7 km, LFC at 4.3 km) and there is
915 J/kg of CAPE to drive convection. The Niemann et
al. [2005] sounding has only about 60 J/kg of CAPE and
requires lifting the parcel higher (6 km LCL, 11 km
LFC), and so is not conducive to convective clouds (The
Fulchignoni et al. [2005] temperature profile, at most 1 K
lower near the surface, moves the LFC closer to 7 km, but
still results in the same order magnitude of CAPE). Strat-
iform clouds above 1000 mbar, where the parcel is near
saturation, are possible.
[11] The TRAMS microphysics package forms clouds of
various compositions: ethane ice, methane ice, methane
droplet (where methane vapor pressure and melting temper-
ature are altered through dissolved N2 as described by
Thompson et al. [1992]), and mixed methane/ethane clouds.
All have a tholin haze particle as a cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN). Here we neglect ethane and look only at
simulations of methane droplet and ice clouds. Nucleation
follows the classical theory as in work by Pruppacher and
Klett [1997]. The contact parameter for methane is 0.981
(critical saturation of 1.10 (D. B. Curtis et al., personal
communication, 2005)).
3. Results and Discussion
[12] A warm bubble at the surface forces the air parcel to
rise. The bubble has a gaussian shape (s = 4), vertical size
of 200 m, and is centered in x. The bubble is perhaps
representative of forcing from sensible heat flux, but is not
meant to quantify the amount of energy which can reach
Titan’s surface.
3.1. Convective Clouds
[13] With the Lellouch et al. [1989] methane profile (60%
surface humidity for pure liquid methane), 1 K bubbles are
sufficient to lift the air parcel to the LFC and subsequent
latent heating drives convective clouds. Cloud properties
(e.g., number of particles, vertical extent, updraft velocities)
are independent of bubble temperature; warmer bubbles
merely expedite the time to initial condensation. The cloud
top between 30 and 35 km is consistent with Figure 1 and
cloud heights estimated from observations [e.g., Griffith et
al., 2000]. Particle concentration is large (1–10 cm3),
with updrafts over 10–20 m/s (Figure 2). Such velocities
are consistent with the plume model of Awal and Lunine
[1994] and the convection model of Hueso and Sa´nchez-
Lavega [2006]. Increasing the bubble spatial size produces
clouds of similar physical properties. These clouds only

line is a hypothetical methane profile based on Lellouch et
al. [1989], while the dashed green line is the Huygens probe
methane measurement given by Niemann et al. [2005].
Other lines are: isobars (solid black), isotherms (solid
purple), adiabats (dashed black), moist adiabats (solid
orange), and constant mixing ratios (dotted green). The
blue lines indicate the state of a parcel lifted from the
surface (assuming the Lellouch et al. [1989] methane) as
described in the text. The vapor pressure equation used in
constructing the diagram is for a liquid methane-nitrogen
mixture near the surface and methane ice above the freezing
point of the mixture. The Convective Available Potential
Energy (CAPE) for the Lellouch ‘‘sounding’’ is shaded in
yellow. The Niemann et al. [2005] profile has only a small
amount of CAPE between 11 and 19 km.

differ in the timescales of cloud formation. The cloud is
relatively independent of the bubble dimensions.
[14] The freezing point of a methane-nitrogen mixture
occurs near 16 km altitude. Aside from the possibility of a
supercooled methane mixture (which seems unlikely in light
of Huygens observations, [e.g., Tokano et al., 2006], meth-
ane will nucleate as ice crystals above this altitude. The
convective clouds produced by TRAMS are composed of
solid methane particles above 16 km and liquid methane-
nitrogen droplets below (all with a haze particle core).
Falling ice crystals melt at a rate of 100 s1 and droplet
particles carried aloft freeze at a rate of 10 s1. In the central
part of the cloud, where nucleation is occurring, the average
radius of cloud particles ranges from 10–20 mm. Upon
freezing, the ice particles grow to 100–400 mm. Away
from the center, the ice particles tend to be smaller in
size than the droplets. Ice particle average radius is about
600 mm, while droplets are about 850 mm. A small number
of droplets grow to 5 mm after a few hours.
[15] Haze particles are initialized uniformly in the
x-direction, with an average radius of 0.2–0.3 mm. In
regions where nucleation occurs, the average radius shifts to
0.01 mm, too small to serve as effective CCN. As cloud
particles coalesce and later evaporate, they can create
small regions where the average haze particle radius
exceeds 0.5 mm.
3.2. Stratiform Clouds
[16] At the Huygens landing site, there is insufficient
energy for convection. Instead, gravity waves triggered by
the bubble produce layered (stratiform) clouds near the
already saturated layer. Figure 3 shows clouds present near
10 km. Vertical velocities are generally under 10 cm/s. The
abundance of cloud particles is much less than the convec-
tive clouds described above, however particle sizes are
similar (mean radius of order 600 mm).
[17] This thin layer of stratiform clouds at the simulated
Huygens landing site is consistent with DISR (Descent
Imager/Spectral Radiometer) and GCMS (Gas Chromato-
graph Mass Spectrometer) data [Tomasko et al., 2005;
Niemann et al., 2005], and analysis by Tokano et al.
[2006]. They found an optically thin methane haze near
21 km and evidence for another distinct cloud layer below
16 km, the transition region for CH4 ice and liquid CH4-N2.
We cannot make the stratiform ice clouds with a warm
bubble trigger in TRAMS, indicating other forcing mecha-
nisms besides sensible heat flux driving the formation of the
ice clouds (e.g., gravity waves, radiational cooling). The
sounding shows such clouds could form if air is forced at
16 km, but these clouds will not be surface bound.
3.3. Rainfall
[18] The thin clouds at the Huygens landing site lack
sufficient mass for significant methane rainfall. Even after
8 hours, the amount of methane precipitation at the surface
in any given location is less than 108 kg/m2. For the 60%
surface humidity case (Lellouch model), the large amount of
methane in the atmosphere prolongs the storms. The initial
cloud has completely dissipated within 5 hours. As the cloud
particles are raining out and evaporating near the cloud
base, downdrafts produce pools of cold air, triggering
additional cloud formation, and the cycle continues
throughout the rest of the simulation.
[19] Figure 4 shows significant rain accumulation from
the convective cloud, even for cases with less methane
abundance (50 and 55% surface humidities). However, this
is less than the precipitation predicted by Hueso and
Sa´nchez-Lavega [2006]. The main difference is the droplet

profile constructed from Lellouch et al. [1989], three hours
after initial cloud formation. The lower portion of the cloud
is composed of methane-nitrogen droplets. Above about
16 km, the particles are methane ice crystals. The shaded
contours are log10 of the cloud particle number concentra-
tion (where N is per cubic centimeter). Contour lines
indicate vertical velocity (m/s). Horizontal distance (x-axis)
is kilometers.

sounding from the Huygens landing site three hours after
initial cloud formation. The cloud is composed entirely of
methane-nitrogen droplets; no ice crystals are present. The
shaded contours are log10 of the cloud particle number
concentration (where N is per cubic centimeter). Contour
lines indicate vertical velocity (m/s). Horizontal distance
(x-axis) is in kilometers. Altitude is shown only up to 15 km
as clouds do not form at higher altitudes for this case.

mass. Hueso and Sa´nchez-Lavega [2006] grow more drop-
lets to 5 mm radius by assuming 100% efficiency, whereas
the efficiencies for our coalescence kernels are a function of
the colliding particle sizes [Beard and Ochs, 1984]. Effi-
ciencies greater than 90% are generally only found for
collisions between 80–100 mm particles. Uniformly
increasing our efficiencies to 100% produces several
hundred kg/m2 rain accumulation.
3.4. Multiple Storms
[20] A single storm triggered by a warm bubble may not
be representative of a broad convectively active environ-
ment because a single storm will neither compete with other
storms for CAPE nor will it suffer from destructive com-
pensating subsidence generated by neighboring storms. To
explore these potential effects, we constructed a simulation
400 km in horizontal extent initialized with random tem-
perature perturbations not to exceed 3 K in magnitude in the
lowest few hundred meters superimposed on the Lellouch
methane profile. This initialization procedure had the effect
of triggering nearly simultaneously numerous convective
cells. Using cyclic boundary conditions created an effec-
tively infinite numerical domain such that no storm could
escape the effects from its neighbors.
[21] The effect of storm competition is pronounced
(Figure 5). While the number concentrations are similar to
the convective clouds described in section 3.1, the horizon-
tal extent of the cloud and in particular the cloud anvil is
substantially reduced. Upper level storm outflow is impeded
in these simulations; neighboring storm circulations interact.
Also, the magnitude of the updrafts, typically 10–12 m/s,
are 1/2 of the isolated bubble case. The weaker updrafts
further decrease the upper level storm outflow that is neces-
sary to balance the updraft mass flux. As in the warm bubble
cases, artificially increasing the coalescence efficiency
to 100% vastly increases the surface precipitation. Still, even
the standard coalescence formulation can produce upwards
of 10 cm of surface precipitation.
[22] Storm life cycles are also markedly different. After
one convective cycle, the atmosphere is nearly uniformly
depleted of CAPE; no additional storms can develop.
Images of Titan’s south polar clouds clearly show numerous
storms at any given time. Thus, these storms are likely to
behave as the complex of storms simulated with random
perturbations. However, the simulations indicate that energy
for the storms is depleted within hours, suggesting an
efficient convective destabilization mechanism to offset
the stabilizing effects of the clouds. On Earth, convective
energy is typically resupplied via large-scale circulations,
allowing additional convective cycles. Perhaps Titan’s large
scale circulation does the same.
4. Summary
[23] We have developed a convection model for Titan
with methane cloud microphysics and demonstrated its
ability to produce clouds. While the clouds shown in these
simulations are triggered by an artificial warm bubble or
temperature perturbation, their characteristics are consistent
with observations (e.g., cloud top height, large horizontal
extent, short lifetimes). The simulations show that despite
only small variation in Titan’s temperature profile in the
troposphere from equator to pole, the possibilities for
convective clouds vary widely as this is tied to the methane
profile. Moist environments of ^50% surface humidity
produce strong convective storms with large updraft veloc-
ities while a dry environment like the Huygens landing site
can only produce thin stratiform clouds. The appearance of
clouds at the pole, if they are indeed convective, would then
be evidence of a wetter environment than that observed by
Figure 4. Accumulation of methane rain at the surface at a
time of 5 hours after initiating cloud formation. Curves are
shown for three different methane initializations (surface
humidities): 60% (plus), 55% (squares), and 50% (trian-
gles). In cases where the surface humidity is even greater
(70% and 80%) the curves (not shown) are similar in
appearance to the 60% curve, but peak at higher values
(80 kg/m2 and 130 kg/m2, respectively). Also shown are
curves for the 60% methane case with 100% coalescense
efficiency (circles) and no coalescence (x). The peak in the
100% efficiency curve is about 80 kg/m2. The no
coalescence case has a maximum rain accumulation of
about 0.005 kg/m2. Multiplying the accumulated rain (in the
given units) by a factor of 1/4 gives approximate
centimeters of methane.

the Huygens probe. Future work will involve an analysis of
plausible trigger mechanisms, including surface heating,
topography and rising motions associated with Titan’s
Hadley circulation, and 3-D simulations with winds, as well
as the effects of ethane in methane droplets, which is likely
to play a significant role in the stability of raindrops near the
surface.
