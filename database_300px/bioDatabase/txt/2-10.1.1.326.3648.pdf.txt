Myocytes via Age-Dependent Paracrine Mechanisms

Abstract—The mechanisms that govern the capacity of the bone marrow stem cells to generate cardiac myocytes are still
unknown. Herein we demonstrate that the cardiomyogenic potential of bone marrow–derived Oct3/4/cKit//CXCR4/
/CD34/Sca1 cells is governed by age-dependent paracrine/juxtacrine platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
pathways. Specifically, bone marrow cell cultures from both 3- and 18-month-old mice formed aggregates of Oct3/4
cells circumscribed by PDGFR/Oct3/4/Sca1 cells. In young (3-month) bone marrow cell cultures, induction of
PDGF-AB preceded the induction of cardiac genes and was required for the generation of cardiomyogenesis. Indeed,
in old (18-month) cultures, diminished PDGF-B induction was associated with impaired cardiomyogenic potential,
despite having Oct3/4 levels similar to those in the young cells. Importantly, supplementation with PDGF-AB
specifically restored the cardiac differentiation capacity of the old bone marrow cells. Together these results demonstrate
that, regardless of age, the bone marrow niche contains Oct3/4 stem cells that are capable of differentiating into cardiac
myocytes. Moreover, this differentiation is governed by age-dependent PDGF-AB–mediated paracrine/juxtacrine
pathways that may be essential in the translation of bone marrow cell–mediated cardiomyogenesis. (Circ Res.
2007;100:e1-e11.)
Key Words: bone marrow  stem cells  myogenesis  Oct3/4  PDGF
Previous studies have shown that bone marrow cells mayhave the ability to give rise to cells of the heart, including
cardiac myocytes.1–3 Experimentally this process is notable,
however, for the low survival rates4,5 and the limited differ-
entiation efficiency2,3 of the bone marrow cells in the cardiac
tissue. Moreover, evidence of the fusion of bone marrow cells
to preexisting cardiac myocytes in the heart has called into
question the potential of bone marrow cells to generate new
cardiac myocytes.6,7 Thus, to address this controversy, we
elected to use an in vitro approach to define the cell
population(s), factors, and mechanisms by which adult bone
marrow cells may give rise to cardiac myocytes.
Studies demonstrating that the adult bone marrow contains
highly plastic cells with multilineage differentiation poten-
tial8,9 have suggested that bone marrow may be capable of
giving rise to myocyte-like cells.10–12 The differentiation of
these bone marrow cells into cardiac myocytes may be highly
dependent on microenvironmental and trophic signals. Spe-
cifically, recent reports have highlighted the importance of
inductive extracellular cues in the cardiac differentiation of
adult stem cells.13,14 In particular, endothelial progenitor cells
(EPCs) and EPC-derived growth factors have been shown to
enhance cardiac tissue regeneration mediated by resident
cardiac stem cells.13,15 Moreover, endothelial cells have been
shown to direct embryonic stem (ES) cell cardiac differenti-
ation,16 suggesting that endothelial cell/EPC trophism may
regulate bone marrow–mediated cardiomyogenesis.
Previous work performed in our group has focused on the
role of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as an important
mediator of the cardiac myocyte-endothelial/EPC interactions
that govern cardiac vascular homeostasis and ischemic re-
sponse in the adult heart.17,18 Indeed, the age-related impair-
ment in PDGF-B induction pathways underlies a senescent
predisposition to increased cardiac injury but can be reversed
through targeting the functions of PDGF in the heart.18
Specifically, PDGF-AB is cardioprotective, acting as both as
a proangiogenic and antiapoptotic agent. Moreover, we have
found that PDGF-AB promotes the formation of bone mar-
row cell–derived myocardial bundles in rat models of myo-
cardial infarction.10 These data together with the ability of
PDGF to increase cardiac differentiation of murine ES cells19
suggest that PDGF pathways may be important in the cardiac
differentiation of the highly plastic cells of the adult bone
marrow.
Herein we describe the use of an in vitro system to identify
the source of cardiomyogenic potential in the bone marrow

and dissect the mechanisms regulating bone marrow cell
cardiac differentiation. Importantly, the ability of bone mar-
row cell cultures to give rise to cardiac myocytes was
confirmed by their spontaneous chronotropic activity, the
expression of a range of cardiac genes and their electrophys-
iological properties. We then demonstrated that bone mar-
row–derived cardiac myocytes originate from aggregates of
Oct3/4/cKit//CXCR4/Sca1/CD34 cells in culture.
Furthermore, we found that the cardiac myocyte differentia-
tion of these aggregates is related to the age-associated
changes in PDGF pathways. Specifically, cultures of bone
marrow cells from both young (3-month) and old (18-month)
mice gave rise to Oct3/4 aggregates surrounded by PDGF
receptor (R) cells. In the young cultures, PDGF-B expres-
sion preceded the induction of cardiac myocyte differentia-
tion. In the old cell cultures, a marked reduction in the
PDGF-B induction was associated with a significant decrease
in cardiac myocyte gene expression. Importantly, addition of
PDGF restored the cardiomyogenic induction of the aging
cultures, demonstrating the importance of local microenvi-
ronmental cues in the differentiation of bone marrow derived
cells into functional cardiac myocytes.

Results
Bone Marrow Cells Differentiate Into Functionally
Active Clusters of Cardiac Myocytes
Culturing bone marrow cells under conditions previously
reported to promote bone marrow derivation of chronotropic
activity and expression of  (adult)- and  (fetal)-myosin
heavy chain (MHC),10 confirmed the differentiation of the
bone marrow cells into clusters of cardiac myocytes (CCMs)
as demonstrated using a panel of molecular and protein
makers. Specifically, immunocytological (Figure 1A) and
RT-PCR analysis (Figure 1B) of both bone marrow cell
cultures and isolated spontaneously contracting cells revealed
the expression of the following cardiac markers: the sarco-
meric proteins cardiac troponin-T (cTnT), -sarcomeric ac-
tinin, -cardiac actin, -MHC, -MHC, light chain ventric-
ular myosin (MLC-2V); the transcription factor Nkx2.5/csx;
the gap junction proteins connexin43 (Cx43) and connexin40
(Cx40). The cardiac myocyte differentiation of the bone
marrow cells was associated with the expression of 1- and
2-adrenergic receptors, which are critical in the regulation of
cardiac chronotropic function (Figure 1C and 1D).20 Indeed,
this cardiac gene profile correlated with observational studies
of spontaneous chronotropy (Videos 1 and 2 in the online
data supplement) in the newly formed CCMs (60.112.2
contractions per minute).
Based on the development of the bone marrow cells into
phenotypic cardiac myocytes, day-7 CCMs were selected for
functional analysis. Data were acquired using a microelec-
trode array (Figure 1E, a and b), before (Figure 1E, c) and
after (Figure 1E, d) stimulation with 1 mol/L isoproterenol,
showing an increase in the depolarization rate, depolarization
amplitude, and maximum electropotential amplitude (Table
1). Together, these findings confirmed the reactivity of CCMs
to -adrenergic stimulation and thus the phenotypic function
of the bone marrow–derived cardiac myocytes.
Cardiac Myocytes Derive From Oct3/4 Cells,
Forming Stem Cell Aggregates or Bone
Marrow–Derived Spheres
Observational studies revealed that clusters of cTnT cells
(28.64.5% of total CCMs cells) form at day 7 at the
periphery of spherical cellular aggregates, termed bone mar-
row spheres (BMSs) (Figure 2A, c and d). The number of
these BMSs reached a peak at day 7 (6.01.9 BMS/animal,
day 5; 10.71.9, day 7; 5.82.3, day 14), when spontaneous
chronotropic activity was also observed in 1/3 of the BMSs
(32.910.6%). The size of the CCMs budding from the
periphery of the BMSs gradually increased between days 10
and 14, when they detached and were observed in suspension
(Figure 2A, e and f).
Notably, the formation of BMSs and subsequent CCMs was
highly dependent the concentration of cells at the time of initial
plating. Specifically, serial dilution studies revealed that cell
density is critical in the formation of BMSs and CCMs chronot-
ropy (Table 2). The highest number of BMSs was observed in
the wells with 7.0106 cells/well, whereas at lower concentra-
tions (3.5106 to 1.7106 cells/well) few BMSs were formed
and none developed chronotropic activity.
Experiments were then conducted to determine the mech-
anisms governing the generation of cardiac myocytes from
the BMSs. To isolate the BMS cells from the non-BMS cells,
spheres were selected by microdissection at day 5, before the
onset of chronotropic activity and cultured on fibronectin.
Onset of chronotropic activity was observed at day 14 (Figure
2B, a and b) in 1/3 of the BMSs (N7/24). In addition,
approximately one-third of the cell clusters in suspension at
day 21 were found to be cTnT (N67/214). These findings
represent a 1-week delay in the onset of chronotropic activity
and CCMs formation, compared with control cultures, sug-
gesting that an interaction with cells and/or extracellular
signals outside of the BMS may be important for cardiac
myocyte differentiation. Alternatively, we considered that the
mechanical disruption of the BMS might account for the
delay in cardiac myocytes generation. To test this, genetically
labeled LacZ BMSs were isolated at day-5 whole bone
marrow cell cultures prepared from ROSA-26 mice, dissoci-
ated into single-cell suspensions and mixed with intact
wild-type whole bone marrow cell cultures forming BMSs.
Notably, the presence of cTnT/-galactose (-Gal) cells
in day-14 CCMs, which were composed predominately of
-Gal cells, and the lack of cTnT/-Gal cells alone
(Figure 2B, c and d), supported the importance of microen-
vironmental interactions in the generation of bone marrow–
derived cardiac myocytes.

The temporal patterns of cardiac differentiation and the
morphology of the BMSs were similar to those observed in
studies of ES cell–derived embryoid bodies16 and cardiospheres
derived from resident cardiac stem cells.21,22 Based on these
parallels, molecular and immunocytochemical studies were con-
ducted to assess the stem cell nature of the BMSs capable of
giving rise to the cardiac myocytes. RT-PCR analysis of the
bone marrow–derived BMSs demonstrated the expression of
Oct3/4 as well as the stem cell markers nanog, Dppa3 (devel-
opmental pluripotency-associated 3), and prominin-1/AC133
and the progenitor cell marker nestin (Figure 2C). Quantitative
RT-PCR revealed that the levels of Oct3/4, nanog, and Dppa3 in
the day-7 BMSs were 10% of those observed in ES cells.
Between day 7 and 14, there was a significant down regulation
in the expression of these genes (unpaired t test; Oct3/4,
P0.04; nanog, P0.019; Dppa3, P0.005) as well as
prominin-1 (P0.04). Notably, however, immunostaining re-
vealed the continued presences of Oct3/4 in the day-7 and -14
BMSs (Figure 2D, e and f). Conversely, the levels of expression
of nestin increased in day-14 BMSs compared with day 7
(P0.003), indicating a possible transition from a more undif-
ferentiated state to a progenitor state committed to the cardiac
lineage (Figure 2D, g).
Derivation of cardiac myocytes from Oct3/4 cells localized
in the BMSs was then confirmed by confocal imaging of day-14
BMSs double stained for Oct3/4 and cTnT (Figure 2E, a through
c; supplemental Video 3). Z-Stack imaging of day-14 BMSs
revealed that Oct3/4 cells concentrate in the core of the BMSs
(Figure 2E, a), whereas cTnT cells predominately localized to
the periphery of the BMSs (Figure 2E, b and c). Detailed
analysis revealed the presence of cTnT Oct3/4 cells in the

2E, d through f), representing approximately one-fourth of the
cardiac myocytes found in the BMSs (cTnT cells: Oct3/4,
2.91.9%; Oct3/4, 10.81.9%, of total CCMs cells). To
further confirm the key role played by Oct3/4 cells in cardiac
differentiation, targeted Oct3/4 small interfering (siRNA) was
performed on day-1 bone marrow cell cultures (Figure 2F).
Reduction of Oct3/4 expression at day 3 significantly reduced
day-7 expression of the cardiac marker -MHC.

confirmed the presence of the Oct3/4 cells in the bone
marrow (Figure 3A, a). The cells were present as isolated
cells, mostly localized close to the osteoblastic niche. Con-
sistent with this, immunostaining of freshly isolated bone
marrow cells confirmed Oct3/4 expression in rare, isolated
cells (0.050.03% of cells) (Figure 3A, b).
In vitro analysis of the bone marrow cells revealed signif-
icant phenotypic heterogeneity within the Oct3/4 cell pop-
ulation that only partially overlapped with that of stem cell
populations previously described (Figure 3B; supplemental
Figure I). Notably, only a fraction of the Oct3/4 cells
costained for the stem cell marker cKit (17.11.7%; Figure
3B, a, and Figure 3C), which is also expressed by resident
cardiac stem cells21,22 and CXCR4 (58.316.7%; Figure 3B,
c, and Figure 3C), which has been found in association with
Oct3/4 in a population of multipotent bone marrow stem cells
previously described.23
Furthermore, the Oct3/4 cells were negative for the
hematopoietic cell markers CD34 and CD45, as well as the
mesenchymal stem cell marker Sca1/CD31 (Figure 3B, a and
g), which has been previously used to isolate cells for cardiac
regeneration.12,23,24 Additional staining showed that a propor-
tion of Oct3/4 cells also expressed the vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor, Flk1/VEGFR2 (21.55%) and the
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) (16.412.1%),
with only a small proportion of dual positive cells
(6.64.6%; Figure 3B, e; 3C; supplemental Figure I). Indeed,

cells positive for cKit, CXCR4, Flk1, or FGFR1 primarily
composed the BMSs (Figure 3B, b, d, and f) highlighted the
nonuniform composition of the Oct3/4 cell aggregates that
give rise to cardiac myocytes. Finally, although Oct3/4 cells
did not initially express CD45, CD45 cells were observed at
day 14 at the periphery of developing BMSs, possibly as a
result of the differentiation process (Figure 3B, h).
Cardiac Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stem Cells Is
Mediated by PDGFR/Ligand Signaling Pathways
Immunostaining revealed that day-14 BMSs are surrounded
by a distinct population of PDGFRcells (Figure 4A, d) that
are Oct3/4, CD34, and Sca1 (Figure 4A, a through c and
g). Analysis of phosphorylation patterns confirmed PDGFR
activation (Figure 4A, e and f). Notably, the predominant
phosphorylation on PDGFR Tyr720 (Figure 4A, e and g) as
compared with Tyr754 (Figure 4A, f) is suggestive of
signaling through an  receptor homodimeric complex rather
than a heterodimerization with  receptor.25,26 Indeed, immu-
nostaining demonstrated a lack of PDGFR (native or phos-
phorylated) within or adjacent the BMSs (Figure 4A, h, and
Figure 4A, h, inset) and molecular analysis revealed expres-
sion of PDGFR but not PDGFR in the bone marrow cell
cultures or the BMSs themselves (Figure 4B).
These data are further supported by our previous observa-
tion that PDGFR cells localize to sites of bone marrow
cell–mediated cardiac regeneration10 and further supports the
hypothesis that the generation of bone marrow–derived
cardiac myocytes from Oct3/4 stem cells may be regulated
by PDGF/PDGFR signaling pathway. To test this hypothe-
sis, we assessed the effects of neutralizing antibodies, selec-
tively blocking PDGFR or PDGFR, on the differentiation
of bone marrow stem cells cultured for 7 days under cardiom-
yogenic conditions. Significantly, our results showed that
blocking of PDGFR, but not PDGFR, prevented the
expression of -MHC, used as a marker of cardiac differen-
tiation (Figure 4B).
Gene profiling of Oct3/4, - and -MHC, PDGF-A, -B, -C,
and -D in differentiating bone marrow cells cultures also
suggested a correlation between cardiac differentiation of

(FITC; arrowhead) (a) and CD34 (TR) (b) but express Sca1 (TR) (c). Cells expressing PDGFR (FITC; arrows) (d) were found at the
periphery of day-14 BMSs. Activation of PDGFR was confirmed by its phosphorylation on Tyr720 (p720-PDGFR; FITC) (e), predomi-
nantly observed in the  homodimer. Phosphorylation on Tyr754 (p754-PDGFR; FITC) (f), usually associated with the  heterodimer,
was only occasionally observed. Colocalization of pTyr720-PDGFR (FITC) and Sca1 (Cy3) was also observed at the periphery of
day-14 BMSs (arrows) (g). PDGFR, in its native or phosphorylated form (TR) (h and h, inset) was not expressed in the BMSs.

PDGF-D, which has an exclusive affinity for PDGFR and remained at basal levels during cardiac differentiation. Data are expressed as

bone marrow stem cells and PDGFR/PDGF signaling path-
ways. RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR results (Figure 4C)
confirmed the kinetics of the reduction in Oct3/4 expression
and the induction of cardiac myocyte genes, similar to what
has been previously described for ES cell cardiac myocyte
derivation.16 The levels of expression of -MHC became
detectable at day 5 and dramatically increased at day 7,
whereas a-MHC was not detectable until day 7 and peaked at
day 14. Notably, induction of PDGF-A, -B, and -C, which can
all form dimers (PDGF-AA, -BB, -AB, -CC) that can signal
through PDGFR,27 was inversely correlated with the de-
crease in Oct3/4 and preceded the expression of -MHC and
the development of chronotropic activity (Figure 4C). On the
contrary, PDGF-D, which interacts only with PDGFR,
remained at basal levels during differentiation. Together with
the results of the receptor neutralization studies, these find-
ings suggested that PDGFR ligand(s) were central in the
differentiation of cardiac myocytes from bone marrow–
derived Oct3/4 cells.
Cardiac Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stem Cells Is
Mediated by PDGF-AB/PDGFR Signaling Pathways
To better evaluate the significance of the PDGF pathways on
cardiomyogenesis, we elected to compare cultures of bone
marrow cells isolated from 3 month-old mice with cells
isolated from 18-month-old mice, which have an impairment
in the induction of PDGF pathways.17 Confocal microscopy
demonstrated the expression of both Oct3/4 and PDGFR in
BMSs from the old (18-month) bone marrow cells that tended
to be smaller than BMSs from young (3-month-old) mice
(Figure 5A; supplemental Videos 4 and 5). Importantly,
Oct3/4 levels in old bone marrow cell cultures were compa-
rable to those observed in young cell cultures (Figure 5B, day
0 and day 7), suggesting that the old cells had the capacity to
generate cardiac myocytes in vitro. Cardiac myocyte differ-
entiation as measured by -MHC expression, however, re-
vealed a significant impairment in the cardiomyogenic path-
ways in the aging cell cultures (Figure 5B). Analysis of
PDGFR and its ligands showed lower levels of expression
of PDGFR (day 14, P0.049) and PDGF-B (day 0,
P0.001; day 7, P0.02; day 14, P0.001). On the contrary,
PDGF-A (day 0 to 14, P0.3) and PDGF-C (day 0 to 14,
P0.1) levels were comparable to those observed in the
young. These data suggested that age-associated loss of
cardiomyogenic potential is attributable to a specific dysregu-
lation of the PDGF-B/PDGFR signaling, rather than impair-
ment in the Oct3/4 stem cell compartment. To this end,
supplementation of PDGF-AB, which has cardioprotective
effects on the aging rodent heart,18 was sufficient to restore
cardiomyogenic potential of the aging bone marrow cell
cultures, as confirmed by the generation of contracting CCMs
positive for cTnT (Figure 5C) and the increase in the
expression of the cardiac marker -MHC (P0.01), at day 7.
Supplementations of old bone marrow cell cultures with
PDGF-AA, -BB, and -CC were not able to rescue the
differentiation potential of stem cells from the old bone
marrow. Interestingly, culture of old (O) bone marrow cells
with PDGF-AB for 14 days (OP) increased expression of
PDGFR (O: 0.10.0; OP: 0.50.1; Y: 0.70.2; where Y
indicates young), Oct3/4 (O: 0.30.1; OP: 15.03.2; Y:
24.018.3), and -MHC (O: 1.00.3; OP: 3.91.7; Y:
2.90.3) to levels comparable to those observed in the young
(Y) bone marrow cell cultures (OP versus Y; P	0.05 for all
genes). Together these data indicate a specific functional role
for the PDGF-AB heterodimer in bone marrow stem cell
cardiac differentiation in culture and, moreover, suggest that
PDGFR and Oct3/4 downregulation might be secondary to
PDGF-B dysregulation.
To confirm the importance of PDGF-AB–mediated path-
ways in the cardiomyogenic differentiation of bone marrow
stem cells, we performed targeted PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and
PDGF-C siRNA in bone marrow cells of 3-month-old mice.
Molecular analysis, at day 7, confirmed that reduction in all
the PDGF isoforms but only significant decreases in -MHC
expression with PDGF-A and -B siRNA (Figure 5D).
Discussion
Previous reports had shown the ability of purified bone
marrow cells to differentiate into a variety of cell types
including cardiomyocyte-like cells.10–12,23 Here we focused
on the mechanism by which a subpopulation of bone marrow
cells can differentiate into cardiac myocytes in vitro. Indeed,
we have shown that an autoaggregatory heterogeneous pop-
ulation of bone marrow–derived Oct3/4 stem cells can
differentiate into cardiac myocytes in culture. Moreover, we
demonstrated the essential role of PDGF-AB–mediated path-
ways for this differentiation, revealing that a reversible
impairment in trophic support and not the Oct3/4 stem cell
compartment itself underlies the age-related decline in car-
diomyogenic capacity.
It has been previously described, by us and others, that
bone marrow–derived cells have the ability to differentiate
into cells with cardiac myocyte phenotypes.10–12,23 Extending
on those observations, we have chronologically and mecha-
nistically assessed the cardiomyogenic capacity of the adult
murine bone marrow. Cardiac differentiation was confirmed
by the onset of spontaneous chronotropic activity associated
with the expression of a range of cardiac genes. Notably, the
relative proportion of -MHC and the rounded shape of the
cells, including those with chronotropic activity is consistent
with the development of fetal/neonatal cardiac myocytes and
is similar to the cells generated by ES-derived embryoid
bodies.28 Indeed, functionality was confirmed as has been
previously assessed for differentiating ES cells,29 testing the
responsiveness of the bone marrow–derived cardiac myo-
cytes to -adrenergic stimulation on multifield electrodes.
Together, these experiments enabled us to confirm the in vitro
differentiation of bone marrow cells into cardiac myocytes.
Our identification of the BMSs as the source of cardiom-
yogenic potential facilitated our assessment of this subpopu-
lation of cells. BMSs were morphologically similar to other
stem cell aggregates with cardiomyogenic potential, such as
ES cell–derived embryoid bodies16 and cardiospheres ob-
tained by culturing resident cardiac stem cells.21,22 Indeed, the
cardiac gene profiling and induction of spontaneous chrono-
tropic function in the bone marrow cultures was also compa-
rable to that observed during murine ES cell cardiac
differentiation.16,30

Molecular and immunocytochemical analysis of the BMSs
confirmed the expression of the stem cell markers Oct3/4,31
nanog,32 and Dppa3,33 which are also expressed by undiffer-
entiated ES cells. The BMSs also expressed prominin-1,34
which was originally considered a progenitor cell marker but
has been found, more recently, in adult stem cells in associ-
ation with the pluripotency markers Oct3/4, Rex-1, Sox-1,
and Sox-2,35–37 suggesting it might be expressed in more
primitive cell types. Furthermore, downregulation of these
genes, and in particular Oct3/4, in the BMSs during cardiac
differentiation is consistent with what has been observed in
mouse embryoid bodies.16 Moreover, the coexpression of
Oct3/4 and cTnT cells in BMSs and the inverse temporal
correlation between Oct3/4 expression and the induction -
and -MHC offers further proof that the cardiac myocytes
differentiate from a primitive subpopulation of Oct3/4 stem
cells. Notably, the decrease in Oct3/4 coincided with the
upregulation in nestin, a gene that has been shown to be

coexpressed with early cardiac markers in ES cells committed
to the cardiac lineage.38,39 Indeed, together these findings
suggest that bone marrow-cell cardiac differentiation or bone
marrow cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes might
progress from a more plastic stem cell stage (Oct3/4high/
nestinlow) to an intermediate, lineage restricted, cardiac pro-
genitor cell stage (Oct3/4low/nestinhigh).
Like recent studies showing that the cardiomyogenic po-
tential of cardiac stem cells correlates negatively with CD31/
Sca140 and positively with cKit,21,22 the present findings
suggest that cells of the BMSs may be similar to resident
cardiac stem cells. Indeed, the phenotypic similarities we
found between bone marrow–derived stem cells and cardiac
stem cell populations support the possibility that the bone
marrow and the heart may be part of the same stem cell
compartment, potentially connected by the systemic circula-
tion. Moreover, the characterization of the Oct3/4 cells with
cardiomyogenic suggested they represent a heterogeneous
population of cells that only partially overlapped with stem
cell populations previously described. The lack of expression
of CD34 and CD45 suggests that they do not belong to the
hematopoietic compartment. The Sca1/cKit//CXCR4/
phenotype of the cells, in association with their higher levels
of Oct3/4 expression, suggests that they are distinct from the
Sca1/cKit/Oct3/4/low mesenchymal stem cell population9,41
and the Sca1/CXCR4/Oct3/4 multipotent bone marrow
stem cell subpopulation.23
In addition to identifying a source of the cardiomyogenic
potential in the adult bone marrow, our data offer important
mechanistic insights into the differentiation of bone marrow
cells into functional cardiac tissue. Expression of Flk1 and
FGFR1 in the Oct3/4 cells, albeit in a heterogeneous pattern,
are consistent with the importance of VEGF and basic
fibroblast growth factor (FGF-b) in the generation of bone
marrow–derived cardiac myocytes.10 In particular, the ex-
pression of Flk1 at sites of cardiac differentiation is consistent
with the central support role of VEGF and FGF-b pathways in
heart tissue development and regeneration.16,42 Moreover, the
expression of FGFR1 in Oct3/4 cells and the requirement for
FGF-b for bone marrow cardiomyocyte differentiation paral-
lels the cardiac differentiation of ES cells, where FGF-b/
FGFR1 is necessary for the maturation of AFP cardiomyo-
genic endoderm.43
Our molecular and phenotypic analysis also proved that
PDGF-AB/PDGFR signaling pathway is necessary for car-
diac myocyte differentiation. Immunostaining and experi-
ments with neutralizing antibodies confirmed the exclusive
involvement of PDGFR in cardiac differentiation. Gene
profiling results also confirmed the involvement of PDGFR-
ligand interaction showing that PDGF chains with specific
affinity for PDGFR (PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-C) pre-
ceded induction of cardiac genes. Moreover, experiments
with aging bone marrow cells linked the dysregulation of
PDGF-B to the loss of cardiomyogenic potential and showed
that this can be reversed only by supplementation of PDGF-
AB. The reduction in the expression of cardiac genes ob-
served after PDGF-A and -B siRNA in young bone marrow
cell cultures also confirmed the specific involvement of
PDGF-AB/PDGFR pathway in cardiac differentiation. Our
observations are consistent with previous reports showing
that PDGF-AB high-affinity binding to PDGFR is not only
possible, but necessary for significant activation of target
cells.44 Furthermore, specific requirement for PDGF-AB/
PDGFR interaction for cardiac differentiation of bone mar-
row cells is also consistent with previous data showing that,
although PDGFR can bind different PDGF isoforms
(PDGF-AA,-AB, BB, and CC), each receptor/ligand interac-
tion activates distinct signaling pathways regulating different
physiological processes.45 Indeed, such interactions activate
distinct PDGFR phosphorylation patterns that are then
transduced into different downstream signaling pathways.
Specifically, we have previously demonstrated that PDGF-
AB, but not PDGF-AA, mediates the PDGFR-dependent
activity of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells in their
communication with cardiac myocytes.46 Indeed, such ligand-
specific regulation may involve conformational changes in
PDGFR that can govern signaling cascades, including the
recruitment and/or binding of specific cofactors, to promote a
microenvironment supportive of the generation of additional
cardiac myocytes from generated from bone marrow–derived
Oct3/4 cells. Functional advantage of PDGF-AB over
PDGF-AA on stem cell differentiation might also be attrib-
utable to its stronger mitogenic properties47 conferred by the
presence of the B chain, homolog to the simian sarcoma virus
(v-sis) transforming protein.48
Together these findings highlight the importance of the
local microenvironment in regulating the differentiation po-
tential of the bone marrow–derived Oct3/4 stem cells and
are consistent with data showing the ability of PDGF-AB18 to
increase the number of cardiac myocyte bundles in rat models
of myocardial infarction and presence of high concentrations
of PDGFR cells in areas of cardiac regeneration.10 Our
data are also consistent with previous reports showing in-
volvement of PDGF-B and PDGFR in ES cells cardiac
differentiation19 in vitro and during development.49
Our dilution studies served to further support the impor-
tance of cell–cell interactions in the differentiation of bone
marrow–derived cardiac myocytes. Specifically, we showed
that cell density is critical to the aggregation and subsequent
differentiation of the BMSs from the bone marrow cells in
culture. To this end, we speculate that the cardioplasticity of
the bone marrow cells requires a heterogeneous population of
Oct3/4 cells that can interact with PDGFR cells to promote
the generation of cardiac myocytes. Thus, it is likely that the
isolation of individual Oct3/4 cells in the bone marrow may
be essential in preserving the plasticity and/or quiescence of
this subpopulation of stem cells. Indeed, we speculate that
paracrine/juxtacrine pathways in the bone marrow may gov-
ern the integrity of the Oct3/4 cells, potentially preventing
their aggregation and possible differentiation in the bone
marrow itself. Outside of the bone marrow, such as in an in
vitro culture system, our results have shown that the Oct3/4
cells can spontaneously aggregate and differentiate. More-
over, we demonstrated that both Oct3/4 expression and
self-aggregation are preserved in the aging bone marrow and
that age-associated impairment in cardiac regenerative poten-
tial50 is determined by a reversible dysregulation of the
PDGF-AB/PDGFR signaling pathways. This result is in

contrast with previous reports that linked the age-related loss
of cardiomyogenic potential to a reduction of a specific bone
marrow stem cell population (CXCR4/Oct3/4/Sca1).23
This discrepancy can be explained by the different experi-
mental approaches. Previous studies focused on the purifica-
tion and characterization of multipotent stem cells, whereas
the present study focused on the mechanisms of cardiac
differentiation. For this purpose, unfractionated bone marrow
cells were used to preserve and study the complex interac-
tions of heterogeneous populations of cells involved in
cardiac differentiation, which may not have been previously
appreciated.
Notably, the potential of bone marrow–derived Oct3/4
cells to differentiate into cells other than cardiac myocytes
was not the focus of this present work and the mechanisms
governing their differentiation into noncardiac cells remains
to be defined. Previous studies have demonstrated the signif-
icance of Oct3/4 in the extended nuclear plasticity of stem
cells.51,52 Notably, although the BMS Oct3/4 level was
approximately one-tenth that of undifferentiated ES cells, it
was significantly higher compared with the expression levels
reported in multipotent adult stem cells (MAPCs),9,41 sug-
gesting that the murine BMSs may have lineage plasticity
similar to that observed in the MAPCs. To this end, we
speculate that the noncardiac differentiation of the BMS
Oct3/4 cells may be dependent paracrine/juxtacrine commu-
nications that are analogous the PDGF pathways that drive
cardiac myocyte generation. Indeed, we hypothesize that the
identification of such cell–cell interactions in other tissue
microenvironments may enable the development of ap-
proached to direct the plasticity of the BMS Oct3/4 cells.
In conclusion, the present data identify a cardiac stem cell
population in the bone marrow and the paracrine/juxtacrine
mechanisms that regulate its differentiation. Moreover, these
data suggest that strategies aimed at targeting the bone
marrow–derived Oct3/4 cells and that their interactions of
PDGF-AB with PDGFR cells may be used to enhance
cardiac regeneration, particularly in older individuals.

 (a) Supplemental Materials and Methods 
 
Animals. Experiments with 3- and 18-month-old C57Bl/6, wildtype (WT) or LacZ 
labeled ROSA-26 mice were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. 
 
Bone marrow cell culture.  Whole bone marrow cells (BMCs) were isolated and 
cultured in 5% CO2 in air (7.5±0.5 x106 cells/well/4cm2), on fibronectin coated 
(0.1µg/ml) 12 well plates, for 7-14 days, in “complete medium” consisting of Iscove’s 
Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 15% FBS (ATCC), 50µg/ml 
heparin-sodium salt (Sigma), 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin (Cellgro), 10ng/ml 
recombinant human (rh) VEGF (#293-VE), 5ng/ml rhFGF-basic (FGF-b; #233-FB).  In 
some experiments the culture media was also supplemented with 10ng/ml rhPDGF-AB 
(#222-AB), rhPDGF-AA (#221-AA), rhPDGF-BB (#220-BB), recombinant mouse 
PDGF-CC (#1447-PC) or rhPDGF-DD (#1159-SB).  All growth factors were purchased 
from R&D Systems.  Cultures were monitored daily for the development of bone marrow 
spheres (BMS) and onset of spontaneous chronotropy (3 replicates; 3 animals/replicate).  
BMS numbers were calculated per animal, therefore do not reflect the slight, animal-
dependent variability in cell numbers (30.7±2.1x106 BMCs/animal).   
 
Derivation of cardiac myocytes from BMS.  Day-5 Wt BMS, purified by 
microdissection, were cultured in complete medium, on fibronectin coated 24 well plates 
(2 replicates; 10-15 BMS/3 animals/replicate) at a concentration of 1 BMS/well and

immunostained at day-21 for cTnT.  Samples containing 1, 5, 10 β-Gal+-BMS, 
microdissected at day-5 from ROSA-26 BMCs cultures, were trypsinized into single cell 
suspensions and added, at the three different concentrations, to wells containing 
developing BMS of WT cells plated 5d before at a density of 5x106 cells/well.  The day-
14 cardiomyocyte clusters (CCMs) were subsequently fixed and double stained for X-
Gal1 and cTnT to confirm their chimeric derivation from the ROSA-26 and WT cells.  
Embryonic stem cell culture.  The ES-cell line ES-D3 (ATCC) was cultured following 
the supplier guidelines.  
 
Reagents.  Samples were stained with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-
Oct3/4 (#sc9081; sc5279), rabbit anti-Flk1 (#sc0315), rabbit anti-cKit (#sc168), goat 
anti-Sca1/Ly6 (#AF1226; R&D Systems), mouse anti-CD34 (#sc7324), mouse anti-

350 anti-goat (#A21081; Molecular Probes; 2mg/ml).  For confocal microscopy, Cy3-
mouse anti-goat (#205165108; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1mg/ml) was also used. All 
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (primary antibodies: 
200µg/ml; secondary antibodies 400µg/ml), unless otherwise noted, and were used at a 
final concentration of 2-5µg/ml.  Samples were finally mounted with the nuclear dyes 
DAPI (#; InnoGenex) or 5µM To-pro-3 iodide (A21081; Molecular Probes; 1mM) and 
mounted with Vectashield (H1000; Vector Laboratories). 
 
Immunostaining.  Cells were prepared on cytospin slides (2x105cells/slide; 2 replicates; 
8 fields/2 cytospin slides), while microdissected CCMs and BMS (diameter=40-200µM, 
cell number=148±85 cells/BMS) were processed in 40µl microdrops (3 replicates; 10 
BMS or CCMs/3 animals/replicate).  Samples were fixed for 10min, at room temperature 
(RT), in 4% paraphormaldehyde (PFA) followed by 12min at RT in 0.25% Triton X-
100/Tris Buffer Solution (TBS: 50mM Tris-HCl-pH 7.4, 200mM NaCl) or 20min at -
20oC in 95% ethanol/5% acetic acid (nestin).  For surface antigen detection, specimen 
were fixed for 20min at 4oC in 2% PFA.  After incubating for 20min at RT in 1% 
BSA/0.03% Tween-20 in PBS or TBS (blocking buffer), specimen were incubated 
overnight at 4oC with the primary antibodies, followed by 45min incubation at RT with 
the correspondent fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies.  Incubation with 
labeled avidin was followed by 10min block with unlabeled avidin and 1h incubation, at 
RT with another secondary antibody.  All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. 
Paraffin sections of decalcified femurs and tibiae were stained with anti-Oct3/4 
and anti-rabbit-horseradishperoxidase, followed by DAB chromogenic reaction (DAB; 
#sc2018; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Fluorescent microscopy.  Fluorescent images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E600 
upright microscope equipped with: a Mercury Lamp; 40x/0.75 and 20x/0.50 Plan Fluor 
objectives; triple filter combination for FITC (Abs/Em=488-492/520), TR 
(Abs/Em=596/620) and DAPI (Abs/Em=350/450); a Spot camera and Spot Advanced 
program (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.).  Confocal images were generated with a Zeiss 
Laser Scanning System (LSM 510) equipped with a Pan-Neofluar 25x/0.8 oil objective 
and the following laser/filter combinations: Argon-488nm, for FITC (Abs/Em=488-
492/520); HeNe1-543nm, for Cy3 (Abs/Em=550/570nm); HeNe2-633nm for To-pro 3 
iodide (Abs/Em=642/661nm).  For each specimen Z-stacks (1µm/slice, 35-50 
slices/stack) still images and Z-stack animations were acquired and edited using the Zeiss 
LSM 510 software.  
 
Movies.  Movies of contracting cardiac myocytes were acquired using a Nikon Coolpix 
x5000 digital camera connected to a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U inverted microscope. 
 
Microelectrode Array (MEA).  Day-7 CCMs (3 replicates; 10 CCMs/3 
animals/replicate) were placed in a MEA (Multi Channels Systems) equipped with a 
200/10 MEA-60 culture chamber, a MEA amplifier (MEA1060-1BC).  Data were 
acquired for 120sec, at baseline and 2min after addition of 1µM isoproterenol-HCl, and 
were analyzed using the MC-Rack software (Multi Channels Systems).

PDGF-receptor blocking experiments.  BMCs from 3 month-old mice were seeded in 
12w plates at a concentration of 107 cells/well and were cultured for 17h in 700µl serum-
free culture medium supplemented with: 100µg control goat IgGs (#sc-2018; Santa Cruz) 
or 100µg neutralizing goat IgGs selectively blocking either PDGFRα (AF-307-NA; R&D 
Systems) or PDGFRβ  (AF-385; R&D Systems).  After 17h medium cells were 
resuspended in 1x complete medium.  The medium was changed at day-5 and cells were 
harvested at day-7 for molecular analysis. 
 
Gene silencing by siRNA.  Day-1 (Oct3/4 siRNA) or day-3 (PDGF-A, -B and –C 
siRNAs) BMCs cultured in complete medium on fibronectin coated 24w plates 
(5x106cells/well; 4 wells/animal; 4-10 animals/experiment) were transfected for 7-8h in 
transfection medium (#sc36868) supplemented with 8µl transfection reagent (#sc29528) 
and 200nM siRNA duplexes targeting Oct3/4 (#sc29419), PDGF-A (#sc39704), PDGF-B 
(#sc3706) or PDGF-C (#sc39708).  Cells were cultured for additional 17h in complete 
medium with 100nM siRNA duplexes and 4µl transfection reagent.  Control samples 
were transfected with scrambled siRNA sequences (#sc37007).  Gene silencing was 
assessed 24h (Oct3/4 siRNA; day-3) or 72h (PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-C siRNAs; day-
7) after transfection by RT-PCR and Quantitative RT-PCR of the silenced gene.  All 
reagents were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 
 
RT-PCR and Quantitative RT-PCR.  RNA was isolated from microdissected BMS or 
CCMs (20-30 BMS or CCMs/3-5x103 cells/6 animals/replicate), freshly isolated cell 
samples (107cells/animal/replicate) and tissue samples (ovaries and liver; 100mg).  RNA

reverse transcribed with Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen).  PCR reaction mix 
contained 0.5µg/2.0µl template cDNA/reaction, HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen), 0.8-
1µM of the required primer combination (Supplemental Table 1).  PCR products were 
visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative RT-PCR assays were carried 
out using a Sybr Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the primer sets and PCR 
profiles previously described.  Data are expressed as relative values (RV)=2-(∆Ct) x103 and 
∆Ct= (specific gene cycle no - β-actin cycle no); arbitrary units, AU, where data were 
normalized to the relative value (RV) of a control group of choice (=1 AU).  Reverse 
transcription step or template cDNA were omitted in controls.  All experiments were 
carried out in triplicate.

(b) Supplemental Statistical Analysis 
An unpaired t-Test (Fig. 2C) was used to compare the mean levels of expression (3 
samples/group), for each gene (Oct3/4; Dppa3; Nestin; Nanog; Prominin-1), in different 
tissue or cell samples (BMS-d7; BMS-d14; ES-cells; ovary; liver).  Samples in different 
groups were collected from unrelated animals. 
A Repeated Measures-ANOVA with Post Hoc testing and Bonferroni’s correction for 
multiple comparisons (Fig. 4C), was used to compare the changes in the mean levels of 
expression for each gene (Oct3/4; α-MHC; β-MHC; PDGF-A; PDGF-B; PDGF-C), 
occurring over 4 different time points (day-0; day-5; day-7; day-14), in bone marrow cell 
cultures (N=3). 
An unpaired t-Test (Fig. 5B) was used to compare mean levels of expression for each 
gene (Oct3/4; PDGFRα; β-MHC; PDGF-A; PDGF-B; PDGF-C), at each time point (day-
0; day-7; day-14), in cultures set-up from different age group animals, young or old 
(N=3, young; N=3, old).

of the nucleus (QuickTime movie, 33.0 MB).  Video 4 (QuickTime movie, 33.0 MB) 
shows a X-axis three dimensional projection of the same specimen.  cTnt+ cells can be 
observed at the periphery of the BMS, while they are radiating outwards and forming 
clusters of cardiac myocytes (CCMs).
