ABSTRACT
R2 is a site-specific non-long terminal repeat (non-
LTR) retrotransposon encoding a single polypeptide
10 with reverse transcriptase, DNA endonuclease and
nucleic acid-binding domains. The current model of
R2 retrotransposition involves an ordered series of
cleavage and polymerization steps carried out by at
least two R2 protein subunits, one bound upstream
15 and one bound downstream of the integration site.
The role in the retrotransposition reaction of two
conserved DNA-binding motifs, a C2H2 zinc finger
(ZF) and a Myb motif, located within the N-terminal
domain of the protein are explored in this report.
20 These motifs do not appear to play a role in RT or the
ability of the protein to bind the R2 RNA transcript.
Methylation and missing nucleoside interference-
based DNA footprints using polypeptides to the
N-terminal domain suggest the ZF and Myb motifs
25 bind toregions3 to1and 110 to 115withreference
to the insertion site. Mutations in these DNA sites or of
the N-terminal protein domain blocked binding and
the activity of the downstream subunit. Mutations of
the protein domain also affected binding of the
30 upstream subunit but not its function, suggesting the
primary path to DNA target recognition by R2 involves
both upstream and downstream subunits.
INTRODUCTION
Transposable elements have played a significant role in
35 determining the current structure and expression of eukaryotic
genomes. One of the most abundant classes of these elements,
the non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons,
utilize a simple integration mechanism of reverse transcribing
RNA templates directly onto a nick in chromosomal DNA.
40 R2 is a site-specific non-LTR retrotransposon found in 28S
rRNA genes of a diverse set of eukaryotes (1,2). R2 retro-
transposition is highly specific for both the 28S DNA target
site and the R2 RNA template, which has enabled detailed
studies of its mechanism of integration (3,4).
45Recent studies of R2 retrotransposition have led to the
model in which an R2 homodimer (or possibly larger mul-
timer) asymmetrically bound to target DNA affects integration
of the element through a series of ordered catalytic steps
(Figure 1A) (5). One subunit binds the DNA region centered
5025 bp upstream of the R2 integration site (6), as well as the
30 end of the R2 RNA transcript to be used for RT (3,5–7). A
second R2 subunit binds the DNA region from the integration
site to 15 bp downstream of this site (5).
R2 retrotransposition is proposed to proceed via the follow-
55ing steps: (i) the endonuclease of the upstream monomer
cleaves the first (bottom) DNA strand, (ii) the reverse tran-
scriptase of the upstream monomer uses the free 30 OH from
the newly created nick to initiate target-primed reverse tran-
scription (TPRT) using the R2 RNA as the template, (iii) the
60downstream monomer cleaves the second (top) DNA strand,
and (iv) the second DNA strand is synthesized. It is not known
if R2 or cellular DNA polymerases are responsible for the
fourth step, however, the R2 reverse transcriptase is capable
of displacing RNA from nucleic acid templates and the second
65subunit is likely to be in the correct orientation to perform
second strand synthesis (5,8) (A. Bibillo and T.H. Eickbush,
unpublished data). The basic steps of this TPRT reaction
appear to be part of the integration reaction of other
non-LTR retrotransposons (9,10) as well as in the integration
70of SINEs (Alu) and processed pseudogenes (11,12).
TPRT is also a critical step in the retrohoming of group II
introns (13).
The single open reading frame (ORF) of R2 elements from
diverse animals (Figure 1B) contains a central reverse tran-
75scriptase domain, a C-terminal domain with a restriction-like
endonuclease, and a N-terminal domain with both C2H2 zinc
finger (ZF) and Myb-like nucleic acid-binding motifs (14,15).
We have shown previously that a 140 amino acid N-terminal
polypeptide containing the ZF and Myb motifs accounts for

most of the DNase I footprint of the second protein subunit
bound to the target site (5). This study further examines the
role of the N-terminal Myb and ZF motifs in the retrotrans-
position of R2. Protein mutagenesis, DNA mutagenesis, more
5 detailed DNA footprint approaches, and assays of the poly-
merization activities of the R2 were used to examine the
involvement of the R2 N-terminal ZF and Myb motifs in
DNA-binding, RNA-binding and enzymatic functions of the
R2 protein.
10 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mutagenesis and purification of full-length R2 protein
and peptides
R2 protein was purified to 40% homogeneity as described
previously (4,6). The ZF mutation (114C/S + 117C/S) and
15 the Myb mutation (151R/A + 152W/A) (see Figure 1B)
were generated by QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis
(Stratagene) of the R2 expression construct pR260 using
primers with point mutations in the appropriate codons
(4). The new constructs were named (ZF)pR260 and
20(Myb)pR260. The 30-untranslated region (30-UTR) RNA sub-
strate was generated as described previously (6). Complement-
ary DNA oligonucleotides containing the base transversions
listed in Figure 4 were used to generate the mutant DNA-
binding sites. The oligos spanned from 70 bp upstream of
25the R2 insertion site to 30 bp downstream.
DNA corresponding to the 89–229 and 89–289 polypeptides
were generated by PCR using the pR260 plasmid as the
template DNA (4). The PCR fragment was cloned into the
pET28a vector (Novagen) with the His6 tag in-frame at
30the amino terminus. The pET28a construct was placed into
BL21(DE3) RIL codon + bacteria (Stratagene) for inducible
expression with Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
The construct for the ZF polypeptide was generated in an
identical fashion except that the DNA template used to
35generate the PCR fragment was the ZF pR260 plasmid.
The expressed 89–229 and 89–289 polypeptides were purified
over talon resin columns to near 90% homogeneity.
Enzymatic assays of reverse transcriptase activities
Wild-type, ZF and Myb R2 proteins were assayed for
40processivity, their ability to polymerize through duplex nuc-
leic acids, and end-to-end template jumping as described pre-
viously (8,16) (see Supplementary Data).
DNA-binding and footprinting assays
Substrate DNAs were 100 bp and spanned from 50 bp
45upstream to 50 bp downstream or from 70 bp upstream to
30 bp downstream of the R2 insertion site. The former sub-
strate was used to footprint the bottom-strand (Figures 2
and 3) and in Figures 5 and 6. The latter substrate was
used to footprint the top-strand (Figures 2 and 3) and
50in Figure 4. R2 protein-binding, cleavage, and TPRT assays
were performed in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl,
5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 11% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA,
0.01% Triton X-100, and with or without 25 mM dNTP as
described previously (5). Reactions involving full-length R2
55protein were carried out at 37C for 30 min while reactions
involving R2 polypeptides were carried out at 37C for 15 min.
Methylation interference footprints and missing nucleoside
footprints were performed following established protocols
(17–19) with a modification level of one modification
60per DNA molecule. The DNA-binding reactions (400 fmol
DNA) used for footprint analysis contained 35–65% of the
DNA substrate bound by protein with bound DNA separated
from free DNA on a native polyacrylamide gels as described
previously (5,6).

Figure 1. R2 protein structure and model of retrotransposition. (A) R2 retro-
transposition model. The upstream subunit binds to DNA by means of the
C-terminal domain of the R2 protein (red arm), and the downstream subunit
binds using the N-terminal domain (blue arm). Integration occurs in four or-
dered steps. The endonuclease of the upstream subunit (red oval) cleaves the
bottom DNA strand (1). The reverse transcriptase (green) of the upstream
subunit uses the cleaved bottom DNA strand to prime TPRT of the R2
RNA transcript (black wavy line) (2). The endonuclease of the downstream
subunit cleaves the top DNA strand (3). The reverse transcriptase of the down-
stream subunit uses the cleaved top DNA strand to prime synthesis of the second
strand displacing the element RNA from the RNA/DNA heteroduplex (4). This
fourth step is questioned because it has not been observed in vitro. (B) The R2
ORF. The three domains of the R2 ORF have been colored as in (A). The amino
acid positions are those of the R2 protein from B.mori. The variability in the
lengths of the protein flanking the conserved N-terminal domain of different R2
proteins is shown. Virtually no length variation exists elsewhere in comparisons
of different R2 proteins (14). Shown below is a more detailed diagram of the
B.mori R2 N-terminal domain studied in this report. The N-terminal region
(blue) contains two nucleic acid-binding domains, a ZF and a Myb. The bound-
aries of the ZF and Myb domains are shown in light blue with the conserved
residue regions shown in black. The residues mutated to make the ZF and
Myb proteins are shown.

abundant lineage of insect R2 elements the length of the ORF
N-terminal of the conserved segment varied from 30 to 180
residues, while the length between the conserved N-terminal
segment and the first conserved region of the RT domain
5 varied from 35 to 140 amino acid. Comparison of these
sequences from different R2 elements suggested that there
had been little selective constraint on either of these regions
of the encoded proteins (14,20,21).
Polypeptides corresponding to the 140 amino acid
10 conserved region of the Bombyx mori R2 element (4) and
a 200 amino acid peptide that also included the 60 amino
acid connection to the RT domain were synthesized. These
polypeptides were designated by the last amino acid residue
included in the polypeptide: 229 and 289, respectively. The
15 229 and 289 polypeptides could be shown to bind to target
DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
(Supplementary Figure 1A).
To determine the location of the contact points between the
N-terminal peptides and the target DNA N7-methylated
20 guanosine interference footprints were conducted. Figure 2A
compares three fractions of DNA: methylated DNA that had
not been exposed to the polypeptide (naked DNA and lanes
labeled N), methylated DNA that had been incubated with
the polypeptide and then fractionated into bound (labeled B)
25and free (labeled F) fractions on EMSA gels. In this assay,
N7-methylated guanosines that interfere with the ability of the
polypeptide to bind to the major groove of the target DNA
should be under-represented in the bound fraction and over-
represented in the free fraction. Scans of the B and F lanes of
30the 229 polypeptide footprint are presented in Figure 2B. In the
various panels of this figure, the position of the DNA backbone
phosphates have been numbered relative to the R2 cleavage
dyad with negative numbers corresponding to sequences
upstream of the DNA cleavage site (with respect to the tran-
35scription of the 28S gene), and positive numbers representing
downstream sequences (see Figure 2C).
On the bottom-strand there were interfering guanosine
residues at nucleotide positions +15, +13 and +12. On the
top-strand there was one strongly interfering guanosine res-
40idue at position +11 and two weaker at positions 1 and +4.

polypeptide in reaction); B, for the polypeptide bound fraction of DNA; and F, the fraction of DNA that did not bind the polypeptide (free). Footprint analysis was
done either with the top-strand or the bottom-strand labeled on the 50 end. The numbers along the gel represent the relative position of phosphate/nucleotide position
on the target DNA with respect to the central R2 cleavage dyad. Negative numbers are given to phosphate positions upstream of the insertion site, as conventionally
written, and positive numbers are positions downstream of the insertion site see (C). Bands in the N lanes correspond to all G residues in the sequence. Brackets
between the two panels identify the footprint region. (B) Densitometry scans of the footprinted region for the 229 polypeptide footprint in (B). Top and bottom-strands

text, weakly interfering sites). Missing nucleoside interference footprints identified in Figure 3 are indicated on the target DNA sequence by open circles.

The methylation interference footprints of the two poly-
peptides suggested that the R2 peptides bound to the DNA
in the major groove both near the cleavage sites and around
position +13. The 229 and 289 polypeptides yielded similar
5 footprints suggesting the protein sequences downstream of
the ZF and Myb motifs had little affect on DNA-binding.
Each of the methylated guanosine residues which interfered
with the ability of the polypeptides to bind to target DNA has
been marked as an uppercase ‘G’ on the DNA sequence
10 presented in Figure 2D.
As a second approach to monitor protein/DNA contacts
between target DNA and the N-terminal domain of the R2
protein, missing nucleoside footprints were carried out using
the 229 polypeptide. Like the methylation footprint discussed
15 above, the missing nucleoside footprint is an interference-
based assay except that instead of blocking binding via a
methyl group in the major groove, random nucleosides are
removed from the target DNA leading to strand cleavage
(17). Again bound (B) and free (F) fractions of the modified
20 DNA were compared to DNA not exposed to the protein (N).
As shown in Figure 3 there were two regions of interference
located on the top-strand from 3 to 2 and from +10 to +15,
as well as two regions on the bottom-strand from 3 to 1
and from +10 to +16. There was moderate interference at
25 positions +7, +8 and +9 on the top-strand and +6 and +7 on
the bottom-strand. The positions of these interfering nucleos-
ides are marked with open circles on the DNA target sequence
in Figure 2C.
Because ZF and Myb-binding domains bind short regions of
30a DNA helix (22,23), the ZF and Myb motifs of the R2 protein
were expected to each bind one of the two separate zones of
footprinting revealed by the methylated-G or missing nucle-
oside experiments This supposition was directly tested by
generating a polypeptide in which the C2H2 motif of the
35ZF was changed to S2H2 (see Figure 1B). The mutant
(ZF) polypeptide readily bound target DNA (see Supple-
mentary Figure 1) and footprinted by missing nucleoside inter-
ference (Figure 3). Of the two major footprints only the region
from +6 to +16 was detected with the ZF polypeptide. This
40finding suggested that in the normal (wild-type) peptide the
region from 3 to 1 makes contact with the ZF motif, while
the region between +10 and +16 makes contact with the Myb
domain. It is interesting to note that DNA targets with missing
nucleosides in the region between 0 and +6 on the top or
45bottom-strand were preferentially bound by the ZF polypep-
tide. This finding suggests that binding of the Myb domain
introduces stress into the DNA helix that is relieved by binding
of the ZF motif or by removal of an upstream nucleoside.
Mutating the target DNA at the ZF or Myb-binding sites
50As an alternative approach to study the interaction of the R2
protein with its target DNA the two binding sites identified in
Figures 2 and 3 were mutated. As shown in Figure 4A, DNA
targets were generated containing transversions in the region
from 3 to 1 or from +10 to +15. The binding of full-length
55R2 protein to these mutated target sites was then compared
relative to that of the original DNA target (Figure 4B). The
binding reactions were conducted at a low protein concentra-
tion (20% of the wild-type target bound) where most of the
complexes corresponded to protein monomers, and at a high
60protein concentration (100% of wild-type target bound) where
the complexes corresponded to both protein monomers and
dimers. At the low protein concentration binding of the R2
protein to the +10 to +15 mutant DNA was similar to that of
the wild-type DNA, while binding to the 3 to 1 mutant
65DNA was slightly reduced. At the high protein concentration,
the +10 to +15 DNA mutant supported only low levels of
dimer formation compared to wild-type, while the 3 to
1 DNA mutant generated higher levels of a continuous
smear extending from the position of the monomer complex
70to the well of the gel.
In Figure 4C the DNA cleavage and TPRT activities asso-
ciated with R2 integration are compared on the three target
DNAs. Enzymatic activities were assayed after the reaction
by separation of the purified DNA products on denaturing
75gels (5). All activities are presented relative to the amount
of DNA bound by protein and with the activity supported
by the wild-type DNA target set at 100%. In the case of the
+10 to +15 mutant DNA, bottom-strand cleavage and TPRT
reactions were conducted at levels similar to the wild-type
80DNA target, while top-strand cleavage was significantly
reduced. These results support the model that one protein
subunit binds upstream of the integration site and conducts
both the bottom-strand cleavage and TPRT, while a second
subunit binds downstream of the integration site and cleaves
85the top DNA strand.
In the case of the 3 to 1 mutant DNA target, inter-
pretation of the results are more complex because these

mutations are near the integration site. The 3 to 1 mutant
DNA target also supported high levels of bottom-strand cleav-
age, while top-strand cleavage was reduced to levels similar to
that supported by the +10 to +15 mutant DNA. Unlike the +10
5 to +15 mutant DNA, the TPRT reaction supported by the 3 to
1 mutant DNA was only 20% of the level of the other DNA
targets. It is not possible to resolve whether this decrease was
due to an involvement of the ZF motif in the TPRT reaction or
whether the DNA mutations interfered with the ability of the
10 RT domain to utilize the cleaved target DNA as primer.
Mutating the ZF and Myb protein motifs: reverse
transcriptase functions
To evaluate the role of the R2 N-terminal domain in a
integration reaction point mutations were generated in either
15 the ZF domain (114C/S + 117C/S) or the Myb domain
(151R/A + 152W/A) of the full-length R2 protein (see
Figure 1B). The ZF mutations should eliminate the binding
of a Zn++ cation and thus disrupt the structure of the motif (22).
The Myb mutations involved two highly conserved residues
20 (14) one corresponding to a large hydrophobic residue found
in all characterized Myb motifs. Mutation of this hydrophobic
residue has been shown to disrupt DNA-binding by Myb
proteins (23,24). both ZF and Myb mutations were shown
to have significant effects on DNA-binding (next section).
25 In order to determine if these mutations affected RNA-
binding the catalytic properties of the reverse transcriptase
of the mutant proteins (ZF and Myb) were compared to
WT protein (WT). The R2 reverse transcriptase exhibits
several catalytic properties that distinguish it from retroviral
30reverse transcriptases: (i) high processivity, (ii) the ability to
polymerize through duplexed nucleic acid regions (strand
displacement) and (iii) homology independent template
switching (end-to-end jumping) (8,16,25). These unique prop-
erties of the R2 reverse transcriptase were hypothesized to
35be the result of an extended protein/RNA template interface,
which would increase the stability of the polymerization
complex and destabilize duplex regions of the RNA ahead
of the active site. The ZF and Myb N-terminal nucleic
acid-binding motifs are possible candidates for these extended
40protein–RNA template interactions. Direct comparison of
the mutant proteins to wild-type protein suggested that the
N-terminal domain does not interact with the RNA template
during RT (see Supplementary Figure 2).
Mutating the ZF and Myb protein motifs: DNA-binding
45and cleavage functions
We next tested whether the mutations in the ZF and Myb
motifs affected the ability of the full-length R2 protein to
bind target DNA. These studies were conducted in the pres-
ence of the 250 nt 30-UTR RNA to mimic a TPRT reaction.
50As described previously (5) the protein–DNA complexes
observed with the WT protein (lanes 1–3) included protein
monomers with the RNA (M+), protein dimers with (D+) or

Cleavage reactions were conducted in both the presence and absence of dNTPs and the results averaged. Activity is reported as per bound unit of DNA with the

without (D) the RNA, and protein monomers with RNA after
double-stranded cleavage of the target DNA (DM+). In the
latter complex, the downstream DNA and protein had disas-
sociated from the protein–upstream DNA complex. Protein
5 complexes remaining within the ‘well’ of the gel could also
be observed at the highest protein concentration, which was
a result of the excess R2 protein-binding to two target DNA
molecules thus forming large protein:DNA networks.
The DNA–protein complexes formed by the Myb protein
10 (lanes 4–6) was significantly less than that of the wild-type
protein with only about 50% of the DNA bound in complexes
even at the highest protein concentration. A defined monomer
complex but no dimer complex was observed. In the case of
the ZF protein (lanes 7–9), the level of complex formation
15 was again significantly reduced relative to WT protein, and
most of the bound DNA migrated as a diffuse smear from the
‘well’ down to the unbound DNA. The only distinct complex
appeared about the position of a D-complex. The diffuse smear
generated by the ZF protein indicated an inability of this
20 protein to form stable complexes with the target DNA. It is
likely that the misfolded ZF motif destabilized the R2 protein
conformations required for specific monomer and dimer
formation and thus a large set of unstable protein–DNA com-
plexes were formed.
25 The Myb protein was next tested for its ability to conduct
the various enzymatic steps involved in the R2 integration
reaction (Figure 6). The levels of WT and Myb protein
were equilibrated by their RT activity in primer extension
assays (see previous section). The ZF protein was also tested,
30 but this mutant protein gave only low levels of cleavage
and TPRT activity (data not shown) consistent with its
inability to form stable DNA–protein complexes (Figure 5).
All enzymatic activities for the WT and Myb proteins in
Figure 6 are presented relative to the amount of protein that
35was bound to the target DNA on EMSA gels at that concen-
tration (Figure 6A). The amount of bottom-strand cleavage
per unit of bound DNA for the Myb protein was nearly as
high as with the WT protein (average 81% cleaved over the
three concentrations compared to an average of 92% for WT)
40(Figure 6B). The Myb protein was also able to efficiently
conduct the TPRT reaction: an average 40% of the DNA
bound by the Myb protein underwent TPRT compared
with 54% for WT protein (Figure 6C). The decrease in

target DNA in EMSA assays (A), cleave the DNA on the bottom-strand (B),
perform TPRT (C) and cleave the DNA on the top-strand (D). DNA-binding is
reported as the fraction of DNA bound by protein as measured by EMSA gels.
DNA cleavage is reported as the fraction of DNA cleaved divided by the
fraction of bound DNA. TPRT is reported as the fraction of DNA that had
undergone TPRT divided by the fraction of DNA that had been cleaved on the
bottom-strand.

TPRT level at higher protein concentrations of WT was due to
the larger fraction of DNA being cleaved on both strands
before TPRT could initiate (Figure 6D). Finally, the WT
and Myb protein differed most dramatically in the level of
5 top-strand cleavage. Even at the highest protein concentration
only 30% of the top DNA strand was cleaved in the Myb
reaction compared to 80% for the WT protein (Figure 6D).
These findings suggested that the Myb protein was less
able to initially bind the target DNA, even as a monomer,
10 but once this subunit was bound it was able to conduct
both bottom-strand cleavage and TPRT. The ability of the
Myb protein to conduct TPRT suggested the Myb motif
was not involved in the binding of the R2 protein with the
R2 RNA template to allow its specific utilization in a TPRT
15 reaction. The dramatic inhibition of top-strand cleavage was
consistent with the inability of the Myb protein to form the
dimer complex (see also Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
R2 elements have been inserting into the 28S rRNA gene site
20 since the origin of arthropods (1) and possibly since the
protostome/deuterostome divergence (2). The target 28S
DNA sequence has not changed throughout this long history,
all R2 lineages insert precisely between the same 2 bp, and
non-R2 sequences have never been found inserted into this
25 target site. Thus the R2 protein subunits undergo highly
specific protein–nucleic acid interactions involving both the
R2 RNA transcript and target DNA.
The highly conserved ZF motif located near the N-terminal
end of all R2 proteins has the same order and spacing of
30 cysteine, histidine and large hydrophobic residues found in
the C2H2 ZF domain of many extensively studied DNA-
binding proteins [reviewed in (22)]. Major DNA contact of
these ZF motifs is by means of a a-helix starting between the
second cysteine and the first histidine residues of the motif.
35 The amino acids at 1, 3 and 6 of the helix are positioned to
make contact with three consecutive bases in the DNA, thereby
providing the sequence-specificity of the binding. These three
residue positions in the R2 protein are highly conserved, con-
sistent with the model that they are critical to the base
40 contacts: Thr/Ser (position 1), Gly (position 3) and Val/
Leu (position 6) (14). Based on the missing nucleoside foot-
prints (Figure 3) and the methyl-G interference of position
1 but not +1 (Figure 2) the R2 ZF appears to bind the
sequence AAG/TTC, the 3 bp immediately upstream of the
45 insertion site.
Myb-binding motifs are 50 amino acid in length and con-
tain as their core structure three a-helical domains with the
third helix inserted in the major groove of DNA (23,26,27).
The N-terminal domain of R2 proteins reveals sequence sim-
50 ilarity in the region corresponding to the beginning of both the
first and third a-helical domains of Myb motifs (14). Large
hydrophobic residues associated with the first and third helixes
of the Myb motifs are also conserved in R2 proteins, and
mutation of the first hydrophobic residue of the R2 Myb motif
55 significantly reduced DNA-binding similar to that of muta-
tions in the Myb proteins (24). Finally, the R2 motif appears
to be resting in the major groove of the DNA as methyl-G
residues at position +10, +11, +12 and +15 interfere with the
binding of the R2 peptide.
60For most DNA-binding proteins at least two ZF or two Myb
motifs are required for specific protein recognition. The mul-
tiple ZF or Myb motifs each bind short consecutive regions
along the DNA, essentially wrapping around the DNA helix in
the major groove (22,26). While two DNA-binding motifs are
65present in R2, the protein differs in that it utilizes single ZF
and Myb motifs to bind regions of the DNA over 10 bp apart
(centered at 2 and +12, see Figure 2C). Based on molecular
models of the footprints, instead of wrapping around the DNA
helix, the R2 polypeptide appears to cross the minor groove to
70gain access to major grooves on adjacent helical turns. This
crossing of the minor groove may explain the weaker missing
nucleoside contacts at positions +7, +8, +9 on the top-strand
and +6, +7 on the bottom-strand (Figure 3) (28). Before reach-
ing the ZF-binding site the R2 polypeptide may travel for a few
75base pairs along the major groove in loose association with
the top-strand, as suggested by the methyl-G interference at
position +4.
We also tested the role of the N-terminal domain in the
interactions of the R2 protein with RNA. The ZF and Myb
80motifs play no direct role in the high processivity of the R2 RT,
the ability of the RT to displace an RNA helix from an RNA
template, and the ability of the RT to jump from the 50 end
of one template to the 30 end of a second RNA template
(Supplementary Figure 2). The RT domain of the R2 protein
85is considerably larger than the RT of retroviruses containing a
number of extra ‘fingers’ or extensions in the right-hand struc-
ture of RT domains (29). It seems likely that these additional
regions of RT domain, and not the N-terminal domain, provide
the extra binding of the R2 protein to the RNA template during
90polymerization.
A second, more specific, interaction of the R2 protein with
RNA involves the ability of the protein to utilize in the TPRT
reaction only RNA transcripts that contain the 30-UTR of the
R2 element (3). The N-terminal domain of R2 protein also
95does not appear to be involved in these specific interactions
with the R2 RNA transcript. The isolated N-terminal domain
could not be shown to bind this RNA in EMSA experiments
(data not shown). More significantly, once the Myb protein
was bound to the target site it was able to support high levels
100of TPRT (Figure 6C). Unfortunately the ZF protein did not
bind the target DNA well enough to enable a direct test of its
involvement in the TPRT reaction. However, we believe it
unlikely that the R2 ZF specifically binds R2 RNA, because
while proteins containing multiple C2H2 ZFs (e.g. TFIIIa)
105have been shown to bind both DNA and RNA (30,31), the
same ZFs are not involved in the binding of both [reviewed
in (32)].
Finally, the experiments in this report revealed that muta-
tions in the ZF and Myb protein motifs diminished the ability
110of the upstream R2 subunit to bind to the target DNA
(Figure 5), even though this upstream interaction does not
involve the N-terminal domain. This finding suggests that
the primary path to target recognition by the upstream R2
subunit is through a higher order complex involving the down-
115stream subunit. Such a model is also supported by our previous
study which demonstrated that binding by the R2 protein was
reduced to DNA target substrates only containing sequences
upstream of the insertion site (6). Support for this model can
also be found in EMSA assays conducted as a function of time
120in the presence of excess DNA and RNA substrates (5). At the

earliest time points of these assays the R2 protein was dis-
tributed in a series of complexes with DNA and RNA that
included monomer, dimer and larger multimers. Only over
time did this series of complexes become a uniform band
5 containing the upstream monomer, suggesting that at least
in vitro the downstream subunit or subunits tend to disasso-
ciate from the original complexes. This participation of both
upstream and downstream subunits in the initial binding of the
R2 protein to the target site does not appear to require specific
10 protein recognition of the downstream sequences. As shown
in Figure 4 both the 3 to 1 and +10 to +15 mutant DNA
targets supported normal levels of binding by the upstream
monomer. Thus the experiments in this report add support to
our protein dimer model for R2 integration. The N-terminal
15 domain is responsible for binding of the downstream subunit,
which in turn aids binding of the upstream subunit. The
N-terminal domain of the upstream subunit is not involved
in the binding of this subunit to DNA or in the TPRT reaction.
