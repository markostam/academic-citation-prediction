Abstract
Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to
three different human cancers: Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary
effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman’s disease. The
Kaposi’s sarcoma lesion expresses high levels of angiogenic
factors and is comprised of a mixed cell population, including
endothelial cells that are infected with KSHV. We find that the
KSHV K1 protein is expressed in Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions and
can immortalize and extend the life span of primary human
umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) is critical for the survival of endothelial
cells, and we show that expression of K1 in endothelial cells
resulted in increased levels of secreted VEGF and the activation
of key signaling pathways, including the VEGF/VEGF receptor
and the phosphatidylinositol-3V-OH-kinase (PI3K) pathway.
The SH2 binding motifs present in the cytoplasmic tail of K1
were critical for K1’s ability to activate these pathways.
Activation of PI3K by K1 results in activation of Akt kinase
and mammalian target of rapamycin and inactivation of the
proapoptotic proteins FKHR, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and
Bad, which are events indicative of cell survival. Because
activation of the PI3K pathway is critical for transformation of
many human cells, we suggest that PI3K activation by K1 is
involved in endothelial cell immortalization and contributes to
KSHV-associated tumorigenesis. We also report that K1
enhances angiogenesis in vivo and increases tumor vasculature
and tumor size. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(7): 3658-66)
Introduction
Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV8) is a
gammaherpesvirus that was first identified in Kaposi’s sarcoma
biopsies (1). KSHV is common to all epidemiologic forms of Kaposi’s
sarcoma, and its viral DNA is present in AIDS-associated Kaposi’s
sarcoma and in the vast majority of classic Mediterranean
Kaposi’s sarcoma (2, 3). KSHV has also been associated with B
lymphoproliferative diseases, such as primary effusion lymphoma
(PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD; refs. 4, 5).
Kaposi’s sarcoma is an angioproliferative disease, and the
Kaposi’s sarcoma lesion is comprised of proliferating fibroblasts,
smooth muscle cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and activated
endothelial cells. The endothelial cells are infected with KSHV and
are thought to be the principal tumor cell in Kaposi’s sarcoma
lesions (6). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an
important angiogenic growth factor that is expressed in Kaposi’s
sarcoma lesions and can induce endothelial cell growth and
angiogenesis (7).
In Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions, KSHV is present in every endothelial
cell at 10 to 20 copies of the viral episome per cell (6, 8). Most
tumor cells are latently infected, but low percentages of KSHV-
infected cells undergo lytic reactivation (8). These observations led
to the development of the paracrine hypothesis for Kaposi’s
sarcoma pathogenesis, in which KSHV induces a growth factor–
rich microenvironment that supports continued proliferation of
KSHV-infected cells, as well as neighboring, uninfected cells. This
paracrine mechanism to induce growth proliferation also extends
to other viruses, such as SV40, where large T antigen expression in
human mesothelioma cells has been shown to correlate with the
synthesis and release of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) into the
surrounding media, thereby activating the HGF receptors on
surrounding cells (9).
The K1 protein of KSHV is a transmembrane glycoprotein
encoded by the first open reading frame of the KSHV genome. It is
located in an equivalent position to that of the saimiri
transformation–associated protein of herpesvirus saimiri and the
R1 gene of rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (10). Expression of K1 in
rodent fibroblasts produces morphologic changes and foci
formation, characteristics indicative of cell transformation (11),
and K1 transgenic mice develop sarcomas and plasmablastic
lymphomas and display constitutive activation of nuclear factor-
nB, Oct-2, and Lyn (12). It is important to note that these studies
were done in murine/rodent cells, which are much more
susceptible to neoplastic events than human cells because they
spontaneously immortalize in cell culture (13).
The K1 cytoplasmic tail contains two SH2 binding motifs that
together constitute an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
motif (ITAM). ITAMs are found in a variety of immune receptor
complexes and play central roles in signal transduction events,
leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. K1 is
capable of inducing multiple signaling events in B cells (14, 15). Our
lab has previously shown that K1 can elicit matrix metal-
loproteinase-9 and VEGF production in endothelial cells (16), two
factors implicated in angiogenesis and cell invasion. K1 is highly
expressed during the viral lytic cycle, and K1 expression in infected
cells may therefore be able to activate surrounding uninfected
endothelial cells through the up-regulation of angiogenic growth
factors in a paracrine fashion. Thus, K1 is an attractive candidate
for playing a direct role in KSHV pathogenesis.
VEGF’s biological effects are mediated via cell surface–expressed
receptors, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (KDR or Flk-1 expressed
predominantly in endothelial cells), and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4; ref. 17).
Binding of VEGF to its receptors triggers autophosphorylation of
the tyrosines in the VEGFR cytoplasmic tail. The phosphorylated

tyrosines then bind to various signaling molecules, resulting in the
activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-
activated protein kinase pathways (18).
The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in cell growth and
survival (19). PI3Ks are heterodimers composed of a catalytic
subunit (p110) and an adaptor/regulatory subunit (p85), which are
activated by receptors with protein tyrosine kinase activity (RPTK;
ref. 19). Upon RPTK activation, PI3K associates with the receptor
through one or two SH2 domains in p85, which results in allosteric
activation of p110 (20). PI3K activation leads to phosphorylation
of the lipid membrane–associated moiety phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisophosphate (PIP2), which yields second messenger phos-
phatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). Akt specially binds PIP3
and is subsequently phosphorylated at Thr308 and Ser473 by the
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and PDK2
(21, 22). The negative regulator of this pathway is the phosphatase
and tensin homologue (PTEN; ref. 23).
Akt is a critical regulator of PI3K-mediated cell survival (24–26).
Activated Akt promotes cell survival mechanisms by directly
phosphorylating and inactivating apoptotic factors, such as Bad
and the forkhead transcription factors (27, 28). Akt also regulates
glycogen synthesis through the phosphorylation and inactivation of
glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3h; ref. 29). Akt enhances protein
synthesis through increasing the phosphorylation of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR; ref. 30).
It is currently well established that tumor progression is
angiogenesis dependent, that many tumor cell lines secrete VEGF
in vitro , and that VEGF mRNA levels are increased in most human
tumors. Here, we report that K1 can immortalize primary human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and activate both the
VEGF/VEGFR-2 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in endothelial
cells. We also found that K1 expression in C33A epithelial cells
contributes to increased angiogenesis in vivo because mice injected
with these cells showed increased tumor size and tumor
vascularity.
Materials and Methods
Plasmids. The retroviral vector pLXCN/GFP was kindly provided by Dr.
Enrique A. Mesri (31). Using the pLXCN/GFP vector, we constructed
pLXCN/Flag-K1 and pLXCN/Flag-K1SH2.
Retroviral production. 293T human kidney epithelial cells (American
Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in DMEM (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin
and maintained at 37jC in a 5% CO2 environment. Cells were grown in 100-
mm dishes and were cotransfected with 7 Ag pVSV-G and pGAG-pol and
either 7 Ag pLXCN/GFP, pLXCN/K1, or pLXCN/K1 SH2 using CalPhos
Mammalian Transfection kit (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Supernatants
containing green fluorescent protein (GFP), Flag-K1, and Flag- K1SH2
retroviruses were harvested 48 hours later. Virus was pelleted using
ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 3 hours.
Retroviral transduction and stable cell lines. Immortalized HUVECs-
hTERT (16) and primary HUVECs (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) passage 6 were
cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM-2, Clonetics) with 10% FBS.
For retroviral infections, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and infected
with GFP or K1 retroviruses in the presence of polybrene (8 Ag/mL). The
cells were selected in neomycin (G418, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA; 0.1 mg/mL
for HUVECs and 0.6 mg/mL for C33A cells) for 2 weeks.
Analysis of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 phosphorylation. Cell lysates containing
equal amounts of protein were incubated with monoclonal anti-Flk-1
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein A/G
PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precipitates were washed
thrice with lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were done with monoclonal anti-
phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (1:1,000 dilution;
Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). Expression of VEGFR-2 was determined by
Western blot with anti-Flk-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Analysis of PI3K/Akt activation. The HUVEC-GFP, HUVEC-K1, and
HUVEC-K1SH2 cells were serum starved for 48 hours with endothelial basic
medium (EBM-2, Clonetics). The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS
containing 1 mmol/L Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) and then lysed in Triton/NP40 lysis buffer.
Western blots were done with the indicated antibodies, which were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). For the inhibition
study, LY294002 (Sigma) was used to inhibit PI3K activation. The cells were
serum starved for 48 hours, and 16 hours before harvest, the cells were
treated with 10 Amol/L LY294002 or methanol (vehicle). The cell lysates
were harvested, and Western blots were done to detect the phosphorylation
of Akt.
Cell survival assays. Primary HUVECs-GFP and HUVECs-K1 (1  105;
passage 8) were plated in each well of a six-well plate and cultured in G418-
containing media at 37jC. Cells were trypsinized and counted using a
hemocytometer and trypan blue several times a week.
Telomerase detection assay. To detect telomerase activity, 1  105
primary HUVECs-GFP and HUVECs-K1 were harvested and resuspended
with CHAPS lysis buffer. The cell lysates were used for PCR, and then the
PCR products were loaded and run on a polyacrylamide gel according to the
manufacturer’s protocol for the TRAPEZE Telomerase detection kit
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA).
Tumorigenicity in mice. For the C33A cell lines, six groups of five mice
each (total = 30) were inoculated respectively with 1  105 C33A-GFP cells
(clones 2, 5, and 8) and C33A-K1 (clones 8, 9, and 16) per mouse. Cells were
counted, and indicated cell doses were diluted in 200 AL growth factor–
depleted Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were injected s.c. into the right
flank into C.B.-17 severe combined immunodeficient mice (The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, MN). Tumor size was measured with a caliper. The
tumors were excised and fixed in formalin.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumors from C33A-GFP and C33A-K1 injected
mice were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded, and 8-Am-thick sections
were prepared using a microtome. Sections were deparaffinized with
Histochoice clearing reagent (Sigma) and hydrated with water before
microwave treatment in 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8) for 15 minutes for antigen
retrieval and then blocked with blocking solution (10% normal horse serum,
5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS). Sections were
incubated with the indicated antibodies either overnight at 4jC or for 1
hour at room temperature. Secondary antibody was provided in the
Vectastain Avidin-Biotin Complex Systems kit, and staining was done with
the VECTOR NovaRED Substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)
and hematoxylin. Immunohistochemistry was also done to detect K1
expression. Kaposi’s sarcoma tumors sections were incubated with anti-K1
polyclonal antibody (1:100) for 1 hour at room temperature followed by
secondary antibody staining as described above.
Results
K1 prolongs the life span of primary HUVECs. Primary
HUVECs normally senesce after a limited number of cell doublings in
culture. We did a cell survival assay to determine whether the KSHV
K1 viral protein could extend the life span of primary HUVECs. We
infected primary HUVECs with retroviruses expressing either K1 or
GFP and selected the cells in neomycin containing media to ensure
continued expression of GFP or K1. We plated 1  105 cells of
primary HUVEC-GFP and HUVEC-K1 into each well of a six-well
plate in triplicate. When confluent, live cells were trypsinized and
counted using a hemocytometer and trypan blue staining, after
which 1  105 cells per well were replated in a six-well dish and
grown at 37jC. This procedure was repeated over a period of several
months. Thus far, we have found that the primary HUVEC-GFP cell
line could be passaged 32 times before undergoing senescence,

whereas the primary HUVEC-K1 cells have now been passaged 55
times and are currently still growing. Between passage 8 and passage
15, the primary HUVEC-GFP and HUVEC-K1 displayed very similar
growth rates, but after passage 15, the HUVEC-K1 cells grew faster
than the HUVEC-GFP (Fig. 1A). After passage 32, the primary
HUVEC-GFP cells went into terminal replicative arrest and stopped
growing, and their morphology appeared senescent, ramose, and
flattened. However, the primary HUVEC-K1 cells kept growing and
maintained normal endothelial cell morphology. Cell immortaliza-
tion is the consequence of overriding the normal cellularmechanism
of senescence and apoptosis, and telomeremaintenance is necessary
for cell proliferation (32). Telomere stability depends on activation of
telomerase (Tert), an enzyme that synthesizes telomere repeat
sequences to replace those that are lost during DNA replication.
However, in other cell lines and cancers, telomere length is
maintained by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)
mechanism (33, 34). To investigate the molecular mechanism by
which K1 extends the life span of primary HUVECs, we tested
telomerase (hTert) activity in these cells using a telomerase
detection assay (Fig. 1B). Cell lysates from the HUVEC-K1 and
HUVEC-GFP lines were incubated with telomere-specific primers
and primers for an internal template amplification sequence control.
The extracts were either untreated or heat treated before being
subjected to PCR amplification. The heat-treated extracts served as a
negative control for telomerase activity. The PCR products were
loaded and run on a polyacrylamide gel. Positive extracts yield a 36-
bp internal product and a ladder of products with 6-base increments
starting at 50 nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 1B , no increased
telomerase activity was detected in the primary HUVEC-K1 cell line
compared with the vector control. These results suggest that
telomere maintenance in primary HUVECs expressing K1 is
probably carried out by an ALT mechanism (33, 34).
We next investigated whether the immortalized HUVEC-K1 cells
were transformed. Early-passage HUVEC-K1 and HUVEC-GFP cells
were s.c. injected into two groups of n = 5 nude mice at a
concentration of 5  106 per mouse in Matrigel. In the presence of
Matrigel, transformed cells typically form tumors within 21 days if
z106 cells are inoculated (35). After 4 weeks, we observed no tumor
growth in either the mice injected with HUVEC-GFP or HUVEC-K1
cells (data not shown), suggesting that although the HUVEC-K1
cells were immortalized, they were not transformed.
K1 induces phosphorylation of VEGFR-2/Flk1.We next tested
the hypothesis that K1’s ability to immortalize primary endothelial
cells was dependent on growth factor signaling for endothelial cell
proliferation. We had previously established hTert-immortalized
HUVECs (16). We transduced the immortalized HUVECs with
either K1- or GFP-expressing retroviruses as described in Materials
and Methods. Infected cells were selected with G418 for several
weeks to generate stable HUVEC-GFP and HUVEC-K1 cell lines.
We first tested the ability of the K1-expressing HUVEC cells to
increase secretion of VEGF. Figure 2A shows a 4-fold increase in
the levels of secreted VEGF protein in these cells compared with
the vector control. We next determined whether VEGFR-2, the
predominant VEGFR on endothelial cells, was activated in the K1-
expressing HUVECs. Briefly, the HUVEC-GFP and HUVEC-K1 cells
were treated with serum-free media 48 hours before cell harvest.
Equal micrograms of HUVEC-K1 and HUVEC-GFP cell lysates were
used to perform an immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flk-1
(VEGFR-2) antibody overnight. The immunoprecipitates were
subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine-
HRP–conjugated antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 2B (top), K1
expression dramatically induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of
VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells, suggesting that VEGFR-2 is activated
in K1 cells compared to the GFP control. However, K1 expression
had no significant effect on the total protein level of VEGFR-2 in
endothelial cells (Fig. 2B, middle). VEGFR activation is likely a
consequence of K1’s ability to up-regulate VEGF expression and
secretion in these cells.
K1 Activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Activation of
the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway has previously been shown to
lead to phosphorylation and activation of p85, the adaptor/
regulatory subunit of PI3K (36). Because we observed that K1 can
activate VEGFR-2, we were interested in determining whether the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was also activated in endothelial cells.
The HUVEC-GFP and HUVEC-K1 cell lines were serum starved for
48 hours. Equivalent amounts of lysate were loaded on SDS-PAGE
and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies directed
against components of the PI3K/Akt pathways. K1 expression

harvested in lysis buffer. As a control, hTert-immortalized HUVECs expressing
GFP (HUVEChTERT-GFP) or K1 (HUVEChTERT-K1) were also used. Cell lysates

resulted in the phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K (Fig. 2C),
indicative of its activation. To analyze the functional consequences
of p85 activation, additional Western blots were done with
antibodies against phospho-PTEN (Ser380), phospho-PDK1 (Ser241),
phospho-Akt (Thr308), and phospho-Akt (Ser473). K1 expression
increased both the phosphorylation of the negative regulatory
phosphatase (PTEN) at Ser380, which corresponds to its inactiva-
tion, and the phosphorylation of the PDK1 kinase at Ser241, which
corresponds to its activation (Fig. 2C). Thus, the net effect of K1
expression in endothelial cells is activation of the PI3K pathway.
Congruent with these results, K1-expressing HUVECs showed
an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308
(Fig. 2C), events that indicate a fully activated kinase. To determine
if Akt activation was PI3K dependent, we treated the GFP- and K1-
expressing HUVECs with the PI3K inhibitor LY290042. K1’s effect
on Akt activation and phosphorylation was PI3K specific because
treatment of these cells with LY290042 significantly inhibited Akt
phosphorylation and activation at both Ser473 and Thr308 (Fig. 2D).
To detect K1’s effects on the downstream targets of Akt, we
performed Western blot analyses on extracts from HUVECs expres-
xsing either K1 or GFP. We observed that all the downstream targets
of Akt we tested, including GSK3h, FKHRL1, FKHR, Bad, and mTOR,
were significantly phosphorylated in HUVECs expressing K1 but not
GFP (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of GSK3h, FKHRL1, FKHR, and Bad
have been shown to correspond to their inactivation (27, 29, 37).
K1 expression also increased the phosphorylation of mTOR by
Akt, resulting in its activation (38). Activated mTOR up-regulates
both ribosomal biosynthesis and translation of mRNAs that are
essential for G1-S phase progression. In summary, we observed that
expression of K1 in endothelial cells resulted in the inactivation of
proapoptotic proteins and the activation of mTOR, a kinase
involved in protein synthesis.
SH2 binding motifs of K1 are necessary for activation of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Although the cytoplasmic tail of K1
is a highly variable domain among different KSHV viral isolates
throughout the world, the SH2 binding motifs present in the
cytoplasmic tail are always conserved (39). We mutated the two
SH2 binding motifs in K1 by replacing the tyrosine residues with
phenylalanine residues and tested whether this mutation (K1SH2)
abolished PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We constructed a second
set of wild-type (WT) K1, GFP, and K1SH2 mutant expressing
endothelial cell lines and analyzed the components of the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 3B , expression of the mutant
K1SH2 protein could not induce phosphorylation and activation of
Akt kinase compared with WT K1. Consequently, downstream
targets of Akt, including GSK3h, FKHR, Bad, and mTOR, did not
display increased phosphorylation in the K1SH2-expressing cells
compared with WT K1 (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that the SH2
binding motifs of K1 are necessary for activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway and phosphorylation of its downstream targets in
endothelial cells.
K1 expression in epithelial cells results in increased tumor
size and increased vasculature in vivo . We have previously
shown that K1 can induce the expression and secretion of VEGF
from epithelial cells (16). To determine whether epithelial cells
expressing K1 exhibit increased tumorigenic potential in mice, we
used the human C33A cervical carcinoma cell line, which is human
papillomavirus–negative. C33A cells by themselves are tumorigenic
in nude mice (40), and we wanted to determine whether the
introduction of K1 in these cells could enhance the tumorigenicity
and/or angiogenic nature of these tumors.
K1 and GFP-expressing stable C33A cell lines were made by
retroviral infection. Cells were selected with neomycin over several
weeks, and three different clones each of the C33A-K1 and C33A-
GFP stable cell lines were established. Expression of GFP was
analyzed by microscopy, and expression of K1 in each clone was
determined by Western blot (Fig. 4A).
Six groups of five nude mice each were injected with individual
clones of C33A-GFP and C33A-K1 cells using a suboptimal dose of
Figure 2. K1 increases VEGF secretion from endothelial cells and activates the
VEGF/VEGFR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. A, conditioned media were
collected from HUVECs expressing either vector control or wild-type K1, and
a VEGF ELISA was done. The quantity of secreted VEGF shown represents a
1:50 dilution of the HUVEC cell supernatant. Wild-type K1 protein induced the
secretion of VEGF from endothelial cellsf4-fold higher than vector alone. B, K1
expression in endothelial cells activates the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway.
HUVEC-GFP or HUVEC-K1 stable cells were lysed, and an immunoprecipitation
was done using an anti VEGFR-2 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were subjected
to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot against phospho-tyrosine. VEGFR-2
was phosphorylated in K1-expressing HUVECs but not in the GFP-expressing
cells (top ), whereas the levels of total VEGFR-2 protein remained equal.
Western blots were also done for K1 expression and loading controls. C, stable
HUVECs expressing either GFP or K1 were harvested. Equal micrograms of
lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analyses were done
for phospho-p85, phospho-PTEN (pPTEN ), phospho-PDK1 (pPDK1 ), and
phospho-Akt at Thr308 (pAkt-T308 ) and Ser473 (pAkt-S473 ). K1-expressing
HUVECs showed increased levels of phosphorylation of p85, PDK1, and Akt
kinases and the PTEN phosphatase. D, K1’s activation of Akt kinase is PI3K
specific. HUVEC-GFP or HUVEC-K1 cells were serum starved for 48 hours
followed by treatment with 10 Amol/L LY294002 16 hours before harvest. Cell
lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies
as described above.

only 1  105 per mouse, and the mice were monitored for 3 to 4
weeks. At this dose, V50% of mice injected with C33A-GFP cells
developed tumors by 21 days, whereas 100% of mice injected with
C33A-K1 cells developed palpable tumors. The cumulative mean
tumor-free survival time was shorter in mice injected with the
C33A-K1 cells compared with mice injected with C33A-GFP
(Fig. 4B). Consistent with Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee requirements, the experiment was terminated when the
tumor diameter exceeded 5 mm or the statistical difference
between groups amounted to P V 0.05. This result was significant
to P V 0.02 by log-rank test. The average sizes of tumors that
developed in mice injected with C33A-K1 were bigger than those
injected with C33A-GFP throughout the observational period
(Fig. 4C). The tumor size differences between the C33A-GFP and

evaluation of the C33A-GFP and C33A-K1 tumors indicated that the C33A-K1
tumors were more angiogenic and more vascularized compared with the

tumors.

analyzed for activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We observed that wild-type K1
expressing HUVECs showed an increased amount of phospho-PDK1 (pPDK1 )
and phospho-Akt (pAKt) kinase compared with the GFP control, while the
K1SH2 mutant failed to induce phosphorylation and activation of Akt kinase.
C, phosphorylation of the downstream targets of Akt were increased in wild-type
K1 expressing HUVECs but not in the K1 mutant expressing cells. We tested the
phosphorylation and activation status of members of the PI3K/Akt pathway in
WT HUVEC-K1, HUVEC-K1SH2, and HUVEC-GFP cells. PTEN is the negative
regulator of PI3K, and its phosphorylation is concordant with its inactivation.
Phosphorylation of PDK1 and Akt correlate with the activation of these kinases.
Phosphorylation of the downstream targets of Akt kinase, GSK3h, FKHR, and
Bad correlate with their inactivation, whereas phosphorylation of mTOR
correlates with its activation.

C33A-K1 tumors were statistically significant by ANOVA with P V
0.001 considering all time points, and at days 16 and 19 with P V
0.05 using Mann-Whitney test (n = 10).
In a second experiment, we increased the dose using 1  106
C33A-GFP and C33A-K1 cells per s.c. injection in each mouse and
observed similar results (data not shown). Upon gross examination
(Fig. 4D), the C33A-K1 tumors seemed more angiogenic and
vascularized compared with the C33A-GFP tumors, and more
blood vessels had developed around the C33A-K1 tumors.
Significance was P V 0.02 by t test for tumor weight (n = 30, six
independent lines). Taken together, our results show that K1
expression enhances tumor vasculature, tumor size, and tumor
weight in vivo .
We next determined if Akt was activated in the C33A-K1 tumors
that developed in the mice. Immunohistochemistry was done using
tissue sections from C33A-GFP and C33A-K1 tumors to detect
expression of phospho-Akt (S473), Ki67 (proliferation marker), and
K1 (Fig. 5). Ki67 is a prototypic cell cycle–related nuclear protein
expressed by proliferating cells in all phases of the active cell cycle.
As a proliferation marker, Ki67 expression was expressed in a
higher proportion of cells in C33A-K1 tumors compared with C33A-
GFP tumors (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the C33A-K1 tumor cells
were actively proliferating. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor
sections showed that Akt was phosphorylated in C33A-K1 tumors
but not in the C33A-GFP tumors (Fig. 5B , a and c compared with
b and d , respectively). Thus, in the tumor, as in the endothelial
cells, overexpression of K1 results in Akt phosphorylation and
activation of Akt-dependent survival signals. To verify that K1 was
expressed in the C33A-K1 tumors, we used HRP-conjugated anti-
FLAG antibody, because K1 was FLAG tagged. K1 was expressed in
C33A-K1 tumors (Fig. 5C, e and g ) but not in C33A-GFP tumors
(Fig. 5C, f and h).
To evaluate tumor proliferation, we quantified Ki-67 staining. For
each tumor section, three regions were selected, and within each
region, the number of positive cells (Ki-67 index) was determined
for five fields at 400 magnification. This yielded a total of n = 135
data points. The differences in Ki-67 index between K1 and GFP
tumors were significant to P V 0.0001 by nonparametric (Mann-
Whitney) test statistic (Fig. 5D). Hence, there was a higher
percentage of Ki67-positive cells in the C33A-K1 tumors compared
with the C33A-GFP tumors (Fig. 5D). This explains why the C33A-
K1 tumors were bigger than the C33A-GFP tumors.
K1 expression in Kaposi’s sarcoma tumors. Previous data
have shown that K1 transcripts have been detected in human
Kaposi’s sarcoma tissues (41) and Lee et al. detected K1 expression
in PEL and MCD using a monoclonal K1 antibody (42). We used an
anti-K1 polyclonal antibody to detect K1 expression in multiple
Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor sections. We obtained a Kaposi’s sarcoma
tissue microarray TA03-008 from the AIDS and Cancer Specimen
Resource (ACSR). This array contains 170  0.6 mm cores from 55
HIV-positive Kaposi’s sarcoma patients that represent historical
submissions to the ACSR.
Interestingly, we found variable expression of K1 in Kaposi’s
sarcoma tumors. A few Kaposi’s sarcoma tumors had no detectable
K1 expression (Fig. 6A, a), many tumors displayed a high level of K1

expression (Fig. 6A, b and c), and other tumors had low K1
expression levels (Fig. 6A, d and e). It is important to note that all
the Kaposi’s sarcoma tumors were present on the same slide;
hence, the variable expression levels of K1 in the different Kaposi’s
sarcoma tumors are authentic and not a result of background
staining or artifact.
In addition, we also did real-time quantitative reverse transcrip-
tion-PCR to detect the presence of K1 mRNA transcripts in 11
Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions and correlated the levels of K1 mRNA to
that of the KSHV latency–associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and a
marker of late lytic replication, KSHVOrf26. Primers and procedures
were previously published (43, 44). In our real-time QPCR array, CT
values correspond to target mRNA levels on a log 1.93 scale. Lower
CT values correspond to higher mRNA levels. We plotted the
unmanipulated CT values for K1 against the CT values for LANA
(Fig. 6B). Because LANA is transcribed in every KSHV-infected
Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor cell, this representation nicely controls for
overall mRNA levels and reverse transcription efficiency, but more
importantly, only represents KSHV-infected Kaposi’s sarcoma cells
not uninfected stromal cells. We discerned three groups of Kaposi’s
sarcoma tumors: Group I expressed only LANA and no K1; Group II
tumors expressed both K1 and LANA but no Orf26; whereas
Group III tumors expressed LANA, K1, and Orf26, indicative of lytic
replication. These results correlate well with our K1 protein
immunohistochemistry data shown in Fig. 6A and suggest that K1
is expressed to varying levels in most Kaposi’s sarcoma tumors, and
more importantly, that K1 can be expressed in the absence of late
lytic replication. Indeed, we have observed that the K1 promoter is
active in endothelial cells in the absence of the lytic transactivator
Orf50/Rta (45). We speculate that it is in those endothelial cells
that undergo abortive lytic replication, or that respond to certain
environmental stimuli, that K1 displays its oncogenic potential.
Discussion
A novel finding of our report is that the KSHV K1 viral protein
can immortalize primary human vein umbilical endothelial cells, a
cell type relevant to KSHV biology. Prior studies on the trans-
forming properties of K1 were restricted to rodent cells, which are
much more susceptible to neoplasia and spontaneous transforma-
tion than human cells (46). We found that expression of K1 in
primary HUVECs extended their life span significantly compared
with the GFP-expressing control. Although these cells were
immortalized, they were not transformed. Immortalization of
HUVECs by K1 did not involve the up-regulation of telomerase
activity, suggesting that telomere maintenance in K1-expressing
HUVECs occurs via the ALT pathway (47).
Activation of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway is critical to
the survival of endothelial cells (48, 49), and here, we report that
this pathway is highly up-regulated in K1-expressing endothelial
cells. Moreover, PI3K/Akt, another key pathway mediating cell
survival, is also activated in these cells. Interestingly, K1
expression in endothelial cells resulted in activation of PI3K,
PDK1, and Akt and inactivation of PTEN. Activation of Akt kinase
was mediated by PI3K because LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor,
severely inhibited Akt activation. Moreover, all of the downstream
targets of the PI3K/Akt pathway were phosphorylated in
endothelial cells, including FKHR, Bad, GSK3h, and mTOR. This
is in striking contrast to the scenario in B cells, where K1
expression specifically only affected the phosphorylation and
inactivation of FKHR protein (15). This suggests that cell type
differences between B cells and endothelial cells may alter the
downstream effector molecules targeted by K1 and that the
extended substrate range in endothelial cells resulted in the pro-
growth phenotype reported herein. Alternatively, the SH2 binding
motifs that comprise the K1 ITAM are more active in non-
hematopoietic cells, similar to other ITAM signaling moieties (50).
It was recently reported that mTOR is activated in Kaposi’s
sarcoma tumors, and that Sirolimus (rapamycin), an mTOR
inhibitor, could induce Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor regression (51). In
this report, we have identified K1 as a viral protein responsible for
activation of mTOR.

no Orf26 mRNA; and Group III expressed LANA, Orf26, and K1 mRNA,
indicative of lytic replication.

Recent data suggest that human cells require perturbation in at
least six pathways to generate neoplastic transformation, and that
activation of the PI3K pathway is critical for transformation of
several different types of human cells (46). Thus, the activation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway and inactivation of PTEN by K1 may be
important for the initial development of KSHV-associated endo-
thelial cell hyperplasia.
We also observed that K1 expression in already tumorigenic
C33A cells further enhanced their tumorigenicity in nude mice,
with the K1-expressing C33A tumors growing significantly faster
and larger than the GFP vector–expressing tumors. The C33A-K1
tumors, like the HUVEC-K1 cells, displayed increased Akt
phosphorylation and Ki67 expression. The K1-expressing C33A
tumors also seemed more vascularized than the GFP-expressing
C33A tumors.
KSHV K1 is expressed in PELs and MCD (42), and here, we
show that K1 is also expressed in Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions at
both the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 6). Thus, our data suggest
that K1 contributes to the initial and sustained immortalization
of human endothelial cells, and K1’s activation of the PI3K/Akt
cell survival pathway likely constitutes the molecular mechanism
for this phenotype. Our data also suggest a second role in that
K1 augments angiogenesis of already established tumors, and we
suggest a paracrine role for K1 whereby activation of the VEGF/
VEGFR and PI3K pathway in endothelial cells contributes to
viral-induced pathogenesis and KSHV-associated angiogenesis.
