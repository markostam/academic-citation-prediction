ABSTRACT
Plantmitochondrialgroup II intronsdonotallpossess
hallmark ribozymic features such as the bulged aden-
osine involved in lariat formation. To gain insight into
their splicing pathways, we have examined the phys-
ical form of excised introns in germinating wheat
embryos. Using RT–PCR and cRT–PCR, we observed
conventional lariats consistent with a two-step tran-
sesterification pathway for introns such as nad2
intron 4, but this was not the case for the cox2 intron
or nad1 intron 2. For cox2, we detected full-length
linear introns,which possess non-encoded 30terminal
adenosines, as well as heterogeneous circular
introns, which lack 30 nucleotide stretches. These
observations are consistent with hydrolytic splicing
followed by polyadenylation as well as an in vivo
circularization pathway, respectively. The presence
of both linear and circular species in vivo is supported
by RNase H analysis. Furthermore, the nad1 intron 2,
which lacks a bulged nucleotide at the branchpoint
position, comprised a mixed population of precisely
full-length molecules and circular ones which also
include a short, discrete block of non-encoded
nucleotides. The presence of these various linear
and circular forms of excised intron molecules in
plant mitochondria points to multiple novel group II
splicing mechanisms in vivo.
INTRODUCTION
Almost all plant mitochondrial introns belong to the highly
structured ribozymic group II class and the majority are loc-
ated within NADH dehydrogenase (nad) genes encoding
complex I components of the respiratory chain. To date, a
total of 25 have been identified among various flowering
plants, and that includes six of the trans-splicing
type [reviewed in (1,2)]. Group II introns are also found in
organellar genes of other eukaryotes (excluding animals), as
well as in a few bacterial genes [reviewed in (1,3,4)]. In some
cases, these introns have autocatalytic activity in vitro, even
though intron-encoded RNA maturases and/or host-encoded
protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo. Only a
few examples of self-splicing introns have been reported
for plant organelles, namely within algal chloroplast genes
(5,6), but notably none in plant mitochondria.
Conventional group II introns are excised through two
transesterification steps, with the 20-OH of an unpaired aden-
osine 7–8 nt from the 30 end of the intron acting as the first
attacking nucleophile. This is the same biochemical mechan-
ism as for nuclear spliceosomal introns and such similari-
ties suggest that they share a common evolutionary origin
[cf. Ref. (7)]. For both classes, the intron is liberated as a
lariat, although group II ones have a much shorter tail and
are highly structured with six distinctive domains (dI-dVI).
From detailed biochemical and mutational analysis (primarily
of fungal mitochondrial and bacterial ribozymic introns), key
interactions required for proper folding and autocatalytic
activity in vitro have been elucidated, and they include dV
as part of the catalytic core and dVI which provides the
first attacking nucleophile [reviewed in (3,8)]. In particular,
branching requires an adenosine in a bulged context within
the dVI helix and at a fixed distance from the 30 splice site,
namely 7 nt for group IIA introns and 8 nt for group IIB
(3,8–10). Mutations within the dV/dVI region, particularly
at the branchpoint, can shift the first splicing step from
transesterification to hydrolysis, and in some cases to incor-
rect selection of the 30 splice site (11,12).
In contrast to most other group II introns examined to date,
those in plant mitochondria do not always conform to the
conventional group II secondary structural model [reviewed
in (1)]. The core helices can have weak base-pairing and cer-
tain key features sometimes appear missing. This raises ques-
tions about the mechanistic and evolutionary pathways taken
by such ‘degenerate’ introns. Interestingly, a plant chloroplast
intron, trnV, which lacks a dVI bulged adenosine, is excised
as a linear molecule which is generated by a hydrolytic path-
way of splicing (13). The importance of the dVI structure for
efficient splicing in plant mitochondria is also supported by

mutational analysis of the wheat cox2 intron, in that disrup-
tion of base pairing resulted in loss of splicing as monitored
by in organello splicing assays (14). In the present study,
we have examined the excised physical forms of the wheat
mitochondrial introns nad2 intron 4, nad1 intron 2 and
cox2 intron 1, designated as nad2i1282, nad1i477 and
cox2i373, respectively in the nomenclature of Dombrovska
and Qiu [cf. Ref. (15)]. We provide evidence for multiple
splicing pathways in wheat mitochondria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
RT–PCR and cRT–PCR analysis of intron RNAs
Mitochondrial RNA was isolated from 24 h germinating
wheat embryos (Triticum aestivum cv. Frederick) as previ-
ously described (16). To examine the sequences of lariat
(or circularized) excised intron molecules, a synthetic oligo-
mer mapping close to the 50 end of the intron was used as
primer in cDNA synthesis with Superscript II reverse tran-
scriptase (Invitrogen), which is able to cross 20–50 bonds
(17). Wheat mitochondrial RNA (5 mg) was denatured at
70C for 10 min and cDNA was synthesized using 10 U/ml
reverse transcriptase, 0.2 vol 5· First Strand buffer (Invitro-
gen), 10 mM DTT and 0.5 mM dNTPs incubated at 45C for
2 h. Subsequently, this primer in combination with one
mapping to the 30 end of the same intron was used in PCR
amplification with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). In par-
allel, cRT–PCR experiments (to circularize any linear intron
molecules which contain a 50 monophosphate) were per-
formed (18) with wheat mitochondrial RNA (5 mg) being
incubated with 0.6 U/ml RNA ligase (New England Biolabs),
0.5 U/ml RNasin (Promega), 50 mg/ml BSA (Promega) and
0.1 vol 10· RNA ligase buffer (New England Biolabs) over-
night at 14C, and then recovered by ethanol precipitation
prior to PCR amplification. The resulting cRT–PCR products
will also include any endogenously circularized molecules
already present in the RNA population. Prior treatment of
RNA by heating at 70C for 10 min or boiling for 5 min
did not affect the nature or yield of products. In some experi-
ments, Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was
used, although it appeared less efficient in traversing 20–50
bonds. In the RT–PCR experiments, no product was seen in
the absence of RT or when DNA was used as template
with the cRT–PCR primer pairs (because of their inverted ori-
entation). The sole exception was an abundant low molecular
weight product for nad1 intron 2, which was determined to be
co-linear with DNA by sequence analysis.
RT–PCR or cRT–PCR products were subsequently gel-
purified using UltraClean 15 (MoBio Laboratories Inc.) and
either sequenced directly using Sequenase version 2.0 (US
Biochemicals) and electrophoresed on urea-polyacrylamide
sequencing gels or after being cloned into pGemT-Easy
(Promega) plasmid vectors (19). Automated sequencing was
performed by the Ottawa Health Research Institute DNA
sequencing facility (OHRI) and the McGill University/
Genome Que´bec Centre.
RNase H analysis of excised introns
Wheat mitochondrial RNA (5 mg) was incubated
with intron-specific oligomers at 37C for 30 min prior to
treatment with 0.03 U/ml RNase H (Invitrogen), 1 U/ml
RNasin (Promega), 0.27 mg/ml BSA (Promega) and 10 mM
DTT at 37C for 30 min (20). RNase H-treated samples
were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated prior to
northern blot analysis. Hybridizations were performed with
32P-end-labelled (T4 polynucleotide kinase) oligomer probes
designed based on wheat mitochondrial sequences. The syn-
thetic oligonucleotides used for RT–PCR, cRT–PCR, RNase
H and as hybridization probes are shown in Supplementary
data (online).
RESULTS
Nature of dVI branchpoint region of plant mitochondrial
group II introns
Most plant mitochondrial introns fall in the group IIA cat-
egory, in which the bulged adenosine of dVI is located 7 nt
from the 30end of the intron (Figure 1A, boxed) and the
two unpaired terminal nucleotides (50-AY-30) are involved
in long-range interactions including gg 0 with the dII/III lin-
ker [reviewed in (3,8,10,21)]. Figure 1B shows such an
example in nad2 intron 4, which conforms to this conven-
tional structure and its sequence is highly conserved among
plants (Figure 1B, inset box). In contrast, a subset of plant
mitochondrial introns, of both cis- and trans-splicing types,
deviate from the classical group II structure to varying extents
(Figure 1C–H). The dVI helices of some have a lower pre-
dicted thermodynamic stability than for classical group II
introns, and this can be seen by A:G mispairs in the
cox2 intron (Figure 1C), adjacent A:A and G:G mispairs
in nad5 intron 2 (Figure 1D), A:A mispairs in nad4 intron
2 (Figure 1F) and to a much more pronounced extent in
nad1 intron 1 [Figure 1H, Ref. (22)]. It is notable that plant
mitochondrial intron folding can be improved by RNA edit-
ing, which converts A–C mis-pairs to A–U pairs, although
not all such mispairs in dV/dVI regions are seen to undergo
editing in the introns of mitochondria (23) or chloroplasts
(13), and very few of the dVI mispairs shown in Figure 1
fall in that category (Figure 1D and H, but cf. underlined
lower case U in dVI of nad5 intron 2). Even those introns
possessing strongly paired dVI helices, in several cases devi-
ate from the conventional group II format of having a purine
stretch opposite a string of downstream pyrimidines
(Figure 1D–E, G–H). The cox2 intron contains an A:G mis-
pair immediately distal to the dVI branchpoint, as do a num-
ber of barley chloroplast introns, yet all of those were found
to be excised as conventional lariats (13).
With respect to the lariat-generating branchpoint, the
majority of plant mitochondrial introns possess a bulged
adenosine at the expected position, however there are several
interesting exceptions (Figure 1E–H). For example, a bulged
nucleotide is completely absent from the dVI helix of nad1
intron 2 and its short tight structure is conserved among all
flowering plants examined to date. In contrast, in the very
weakly structured dVI of nad1 intron 1, the first candidate
adenosine is located at least 11 nt from the 30 end (Figure 1H)
and considerable variation in sequence is seen among plants.
In the case of nad2 intron 1 and nad4 intron 2 (Figure 1E–F),
although a bulged nucleotide is present at the expected loca-
tion (albeit flanked by pairs of varying strength among plants)

it is not adenosine (cf. nad4 intron 2) or adenosine in only
some plants (cf. nad2 intron 1).
Indeed the extent of sequence variation among orthologous
introns from various plants in the vicinity of the branchpoint
and its impact on potential base pairing (Figure 1E, F and H,
shaded residues and insets) is surprising given the crucial role
of dVI in lariat formation, as well as the low rate of nucleot-
ide substitution in plant mitochondrial DNA (24). This is not
the behaviour expected of sequences under strong functional
constraint. In this regard, we had previously noted that dV
helices also tend to show weaker pairing than classical
group II introns (23). In some cases, dV structure is improved
by editing, but in other instances the mispairs either remain
unedited or they are not editing candidates (cf. Figure 1D
and F, boxed Cs and cox2 intron U:U). Incidentally, nad4
intron 2 and nad1 intron 1 also have aberrantly long dV
loops, and this is correlated with weak dVI helices and
high sequence variation among plants (Figure1F and H).
Based on such examination of dVI features, we selected
three cis-splicing introns from wheat for this study, namely,
nad2 intron 4 which has a conventional dVI (Figure 1B),
nad1 intron 2, which has a short tight dVI helix
(Figure 1G), and the cox2 intron, which has an A:G mispair
adjacent to the branchpoint and mispairing in dV (Figure 1C).
Atypical circularized and linear introns detected by
RT–PCR and cRT–PCR
To assess the presence of lariat (and/or circularized) excised
introns in wheat embryo RNA populations in vivo, we used
an RT–PCR strategy to amplify and then subsequently
sequence the junction regions of nad2 intron 4, nad1 intron
2 and the cox2 intron. These experiments were accompanied
in parallel with RNA ligase-treated samples (cRT–PCR) to
determine whether linear intron molecules might also be pre-
sent in the population (Figure 2). We included rps7 mRNA as
a control, as it is known to be a 50 processed transcript (25)
and thus can be circularized with RNA ligase. As expected,
the rps7 mRNA template resulted in an RT–PCR product
of 450 bp only when pre-treated with RNA ligase
(Figure 2A, lane 1 versus lane 2, arrowhead).
For nad2 intron 4, nad1 intron 2 and the cox2 intron, we
observed RT–PCR products for both the RNA ligase-treated
and untreated templates, and their respective sizes were as
expected for excised introns (Figure 2A, lanes 4–9, arrow-
heads). Several larger products were also observed
(Figure 2A, lanes 4, 6, 7); however only nad2 intron 4
(Figure 2A, lane 4) exhibited discrete hybridization signals
with intron-specific probes in Southern blot analysis
(Figure 2B, lane 4). The latter may reflect amplification pro-
ducts which include neighbouring nad2 sequences, whereas
those generated with the cox2 intron primers appear to be
due to mis-priming from an unrelated genomic region. Simil-
arly, higher molecular weight products were reported in the
analysis of barley chloroplast introns (13). The apparent
shift from discrete to heterogeneous high molecular weight
products when RNA ligase-treated template was used with
nad2 intron 4 primers (Figure 2A, lane 4 versus lane 5)
may relate to contribution from circularized nad2 trans-
splicing precursor molecules. In the case of nad1 intron 2,
the abundant low molecular weight species (Figure 2A
lanes 8, 9) were confirmed by sequence analysis to be mis-
primed products containing an internal section of nad1 intron
2 that is co-linear with mitochondrial DNA (Figure 2B, lanes
8, 9), and this is consistent with the absence of Southern
hybridization signal because of the intron oligomer probe
maps outside that region. Comparable results with those
shown in Figure 2 were reproducibly obtained with templates
from different mitochondrial RNA preparations, different
cDNA preparations and when alternative primers were used
for cDNA synthesis.
To determine the precise nature of the excised intron junc-
tion, these RT–PCR products were cloned and sequenced.
Such data are shown in Table 1. As expected, the nad2 intron
4 junction sequence was consistent with the excised intron
being a lariat (with a 6 nt tail) based on six out of six
RT–PCR clones and four out of four cRT–PCR clones. At
the branchpoint position, we observed mis-incorporation of
adenosine instead of thymidine, as has been previously repor-
ted for templates with 20–50 bonds (13,17,22).
In contrast, for the cox2 intron only one out of five
RT–PCR clones was consistent with a lariat model of splicing
(Table 1). This was unexpected as this intron contains a
bulged A in dVI (Figure 1B). The other four clones displayed
heterogeneous circles each missing different lengths (from
10–29 nts) from the 30 terminal region of the intron. It should
be noted that 50% of the clones obtained from multiple
experiments had the correct insert size but sequencing
revealed heterogeneous stretches of upstream and/or down-
stream exon sequences in addition to all or part of the intron
(data not shown). This was not seen in our examination of
any of the other introns. Such species might be derived
from degraded RNA molecules, yet it is curious that they
appear to be endogenously circularized. In this regard, evid-
ence has been presented for a potential cryptic 50 splice site
within cox2 exon 1 of petunia (26), but that appeared to be
discrete rather than heterogeneous in nature.
When the cox2 intron cRT–PCR (RNA ligase-treated) pro-
ducts were cloned and sequenced to assess the presence of
any linear intron RNA species in the population, we found
that six out of eight clones had short non-encoded polyA
tracts (1–5 nt in length) and four of these were full-length
introns whereas the other two lacked 30 nucleotide stretches.
In addition, one clone represented a full-length circularized
intron species (end-to-end) and one simply lacked 30
terminal nucleotides. The latter presumably reflects contribu-
tion from the pre-existing non-RNA-ligase treated population
of endogenously circularized forms. Notably in all cases, the
precise 50 end of the cox2 intron was observed. The presence
of a mixed population of excised cox2 intron species was cor-
roborated by direct sequencing of the cRT–PCR products
(Figure 2D). It can be seen that the sequence is homogeneous
until the 50 end of the intron, but immediately past the
junction there is a mixture of A-rich sequences (Figure 2D,
asterisk).
The nad1 intron 2, which contains a short tight dVI helix,
showed yet a different set of features in its population
of excised intron molecules and none were lariats. Rather
5/9 clones showed a discrete 50-ACAAAAC-30 insert at the
junction of full-length introns, and its relative abundance is
evident in the directly sequenced population of RT–PCR pro-
ducts (Figure 2E, boxed nts). Of the remaining four clones,

one represented a full-length circularized intron, while two
clones also contained 50-ACTGT-30 which matches the first
5 nt of nad1 exon 2, and one clone lacked the 30 terminal
32 nt of the intron (Table 1). Similar results were observed
for the cRT–PCR analysis, in that 3/10 clones showed precise
end-to-end circularized species, and the others also contained
either the non-encoded ACAAAAC block (4/10 clones) or
ACTGT (3/10 clones). When the cRT–PCR products were
examined directly, the sequence after the junction
(Figure 2F) appears to be somewhat more heterogeneous
than what was seen for the in vivo population (Figure 2E).
Linear and circular excised introns in vivo supported by
RNase H analysis
Although the above strategy provides information about the
physical form of excised introns, it does not directly address
their relative abundance, especially since the yields of
RT–PCR products may be influenced by reverse transcriptase
being less efficient at extending over the 20–50 bond of a lariat
species compared with the 30–50 bond generated by ligation of
the ends of a previously linear molecule (cf. Figure 2C). To
assess the relative levels of spliced lariat (and/or circularized)
versus linear physical forms of introns in vivo, wheat mito-
chondrial RNA was annealed with intron-specific oligomers
prior to incubation with RNase H and subsequent northern
blot hybridization. In our analysis, we included nad7 intron
4 which we had previously shown to be predominantly lariat,
but which also exhibited a minor population of fully circular-
ized (end-to-end) intron molecules (16,27), and as expected,
the vast majority appear to be lariat rather than linear
(Figure 3A, black vs. open arrowhead). In the case of nad2
intron 4, when we used two annealing oligomers prior to
RNase H treatment, again the shift in size was consistent
with a lariat (or circularized) excised intron (Figure 3B,
black arrowhead denoting 900 nt product detected by
probe), when compared with the native 1.4 kb intron
(Figure 3B, black dot). A minor signal was detected at the
position corresponding to a linear form (400 nt,
Figure 3B, open arrowhead). Also, major products of
4.8 kb derived from the linear precursor of 6 kb can be
seen (Figure 3B) in addition to the precursor and intron spe-
cies which were not completely digested by RNase H.
RNase H analysis of the cox2 intron using two
intron-specific primers revealed conversion of the 1.1 kb

intron (Figure 3C, black dot) to products consistent with
circular (or lariat) molecules of 600 nt (Figure 3C, black
arrowhead) and linear ones of 300 nt (Figure 3C, open
arrowhead), as well as a shift in the 2.6 kb precursor to a
prominent species of 800 nt. The relative strengths of the
hybridization signals for the linear and circular forms
(Figure 3C, open versus black arrowheads) suggest that
both species are rather equally represented in the population,
and this corroborates the results obtained with RT–PCR and
cRT–PCR (Figure 2 and Table 1).
In the case of wheat nad1 intron 2, more complex northern
profiles are observed because there are multiple precursors
due to its co-transcription with upstream atp6 and rps13
genes, and this results in RNA species of 6, 4.6 and
3.6 kb (Figure 3D). After RNase H treatment, when only
one intron-specific primer was used (oligomer g), the signal
for the excised intron of 1.4 kb shifts to a 1.2 kb product con-
sistent with the presence of a linear species (Figure 3D, black
dot versus open arrowhead). This outcome was also seen
when oligomer h was used, the shift being to 960 nt
(Figure 3D, open arrowhead). In both cases, the linear species
appear relatively abundant. Lariat (or circular) species when
converted to Y-shaped structures by RNase H, would be
expected to co-migrate with the native form under these elec-
trophoretic conditions, but there is very little signal at that
position (Figure 3D, black arrowhead and black dot). The
high molecular weight precursors shift to the expected sizes
of 2.6 and 2.3 kb. It is worth noting that the RNA ligase
(cRT–PCR) experiments (cf. Figure 2A, lane 9) might be
influenced by protective structures at the intron termini,
such as the 30 terminal hairpin of nad1 intron 2.
DISCUSSION
Our analysis of the cox2 and nad1 excised introns in RNA
isolated from germinating wheat embryos has uncovered
novel physical forms which deviate from the classical lariat
structure of group II introns. In contrast to introns such as
nad2 intron 4 (this work), nad7 intron 3 (21,27) and nad4
intron 3 (N. Niknejad and L. Bonen unpublished data)
which possess a bulged adenosine branchpoint in dVI and
are excised as lariats, our observations in the case of nad1
intron 2 and the cox2 intron support the presence of both
circularized and linear molecules in vivo (Figure 4). Because
the cox2 intron has an apparently conventional branchpoint
adenosine, it was unexpected that the lariat form was not
predominant, but instead we observed heterogeneous circular
excised introns which lack various lengths at the 30terminus.
Moreover, the population included full-length linear intron
molecules with short, non-encoded polyA stretches.
Taken together, our data for the cox2 intron support a
hydrolytic pathway of splicing generating linear molecules
which undergo either (i) polyadenylation at the 30 terminus
[perhaps mediated by the bacterial-type tagging of transcripts
for degradation observed in plant organelles, Ref. (28)] or (ii)
endogenous circularization after 30 exonucleolytic attack
(Figure 4B). Linear molecules have also previously been

Note that 50 terminal nucleotides are shown on the right, 30 terminal nucleotides on the left and non-encoded ones in the middle. Bold A or T nucleotide represents
position of branchpoint A (cf. Figure 1, asterisk) and underlined nucleotides correspond to those which would be in the tail of lariat molecules. Lower case nucleotides
(actgt) match the 50 terminus of nad1 exon 3. The nad1 intron 2 data includes the analysis of mitochondrial RNA from 2-day as well as 24 h wheat embryos.

reported for the Streptococcus GBS intron, which possesses a
conventional branchpoint adenosine (29), and for the barley
chloroplast trnV intron, which in addition is polyadenylated
(13); however, the wheat cox2 intron population includes
endogenously circularized molecules as well. This might
occur through nucleophilic attack by 20-OH groups at other
positions within dV or dVI to generate aberrant lariats with
longer tails of varying lengths (Figure 4C). However, the
cloned sequences correspond identically to the genomic
sequence at such putative novel branchpoints, whereas typic-
ally an adenosine branchpoint is mis-read as T by reverse
transcriptase (13,17,22). Alternatively, circularization might
occur via an endogenous RNA ligase. It is also not excluded
that the linear molecules which we observed are derived from
the debranching of lariats with subsequent protection from
exonuclease attack.
The nad1 intron 2 appears to be present as linear and cir-
cular molecules in vivo, but they have quite different physical
features compared with the cox2 intron (Figure 4B and C).
Notably, the excised introns fall into three categories: (i) pre-
cisely full-length molecules, (ii) those which in addition have
a discrete non-encoded ACAAAAC block and (iii) ones
which have the full-length intron plus ACTGT (which corres-
ponds to the first 5 nt of the downstream exon). The latter
could be derived from incorrect 30 splice site selection
[cf. Bacillus cereus, Ref. (30) and Bacillus anthracis, Ref.
(31)] and such alternative splicing would lead to defective
mRNA molecules. Because exactly the same non-encoded
nucleotide blocks were consistently seen (and with or without
RNA ligase treatment), these observations differ from those
for the cox2 intron and do not easily conform to a model of
being generated by a polyA ragged tailing mechanism
(Figure 4B). The endogenous linear molecules, which
comprise the majority based on RNase H analysis, appear
resistant to 30 exonuclease attack (unlike the cox2 intron)
and this may be related to the short tight dVI helix [reminis-
cent of the 30 termini of certain plant mitochondrial
mRNAs, Ref. (32)]. In all cases, the correct 50 splice site
was seen both for nad1 intron 2 as well as the heterogeneous
cox2 intron molecules. The apparent absence of exonuclease
attack at the 50 end of putative linear molecules might relate
to protective RNA structures or close association with
proteins.
Our nad1 intron 2 data suggest a combination of splicing
mechanisms which exploit various internal or external
nucleophiles to explain the discrete non-encoded block
(Figure 4B and C, hatched box). The latter would be analog-
ous to group I intron splicing where an external guanosine
acts as the attacking nucleophile [reviewed in (33)]. The ori-
gin of the non-encoded ACAAAAC block is unknown. If it is
added to the 30 end of the intron, it seems unlikely to be medi-
ated by tRNA nucleotidyl transferase or an RNA-directed
RNA polymerase, as was suggested for tobacco chloroplast
ndhD mRNA processing (34), since there is no obvious tem-
plate. Other models consistent with a precisely full-length
circularized intron (which we observed at low levels for
nad1 intron 2, nad7 intron 4 and the cox2 intron) include
reverse splicing or a ‘spliced exon reopening’ pathway [cf.
yeast mitochondrial aI2 intron circles in vivo, Ref. (35)]
whereby the 30-OH of the liberated 50-exon acts as first
attacking nucleophile in trans and then the hydroxyl group
of the intron terminal pyrimidine attacks the 50 splice site
(Figure 4C). Interestingly, in plant mitochondria, uncoupled
splicing intermediates have been observed to be relatively
abundant in some cases (16) and thus might contribute to
such a pathway.

annealed with oligomers as shown in schematics (arrows a–h) for (A) nad7 intron 4, (B) nad2 intron 4, (C) cox2 intron and (D) nad1 intron 2, prior to RNase H
treatment. Positions of oligomer probes used in subsequent northern blot analysis are shown by overlined asterisks. Size markers are shown, black dots represent the
positions of native excised introns, black arrowheads indicate positions expected for hybridizing products from lariat (or circularized) intron forms and white
arrowheads for linear intron forms.

The apparent loss of classical group II features of mito-
chondrial introns in the flowering plant lineage over evolu-
tionary time is supported by comparisons with homologues
from early-diverging lineages of land plants. For example,
nad1 intron 1 in Isoetes lacustris (22,36) and the cox2 intron
in Acorus calamus (37) have conventional dVI structures.
Moreover, the dynamic nature of plant mitochondrial
genomes [reviewed in (2)] can have impact on intron
sequences, such as the genomic rearrangements which have
led to trans-splicing. It also appears that gene conversion
(or swapping) events can occur between group II core struc-
tures. For example in Figure 1, it can be seen that dV and part
of dVI of nad1 intron 2 and nad2 intron 1 are identical. This
also underscores the plasticity and tolerance that the splicing
machinery must have in light of such deviation from conven-
tional structure.
The mixture of physical forms of excised introns observed
in this study suggests that multiple biochemical mechanisms
of splicing occur in plant mitochondria, such as a hydrolytic
pathway as well as unusual circularization events. Their rel-
ative contributions appear to vary among introns and it will
be interesting to learn if there are developmental effects, per-
haps due to differences in the availability of nuclear-encoded
machinery especially early in germination when seeds leave
dormancy (16). In this regard, it is interesting that the steady
state levels of excised introns show marked differences dur-
ing germination, typically being present at higher levels in
embryos than in seedlings. The apparently ‘degenerate’
nature of the folding of these group II introns raises the pos-
sibility that additional proteins and/or small RNAs have been
recruited for the splicing process in plant mitochondria.
