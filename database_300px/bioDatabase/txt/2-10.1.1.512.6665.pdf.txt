ABSTRACT
EndoG is a ubiquitous nuclease that is translocated
into the nucleus during apoptosis to participate
in DNA degradation. The enzyme cleaves double-
and single-stranded DNA and RNA. Related
nucleases are found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes,
which have evolved sophisticated mechanisms
for genome protection against self-antagonizing
nuclease activity. Common mechanisms of inhibi-
tion are secretion, sequestration into a separate
cellular compartment or by binding to protein
inhibitors. Although EndoG is silenced by compart-
mentalization into the mitochondrial intermembrane
space, a nucleus-localized protein inhibitor
protects cellular polynucleotides from degradation
by stray EndoG under non-apoptotic conditions
in Drosophila. Here, we report the first three-
dimensional structure of EndoG in complex with its
inhibitor EndoGI. Although the mechanism of inhibi-
tion is reminiscent of bacterial protein inhibitors,
EndoGI has evolved independently from a generic
protein-protein interaction module. EndoGI is a
two-domain protein that binds the active sites of
two monomers of EndoG, with EndoG being sand-
wiched between EndoGI. Since the amino acid
sequences of eukaryotic EndoG homologues are
highly conserved, this model is valid for eukaryotic
dimeric EndoG in general. The structure indicates
that the two active sites of EndoG occupy the
most remote spatial position possible at the molec-
ular surface and a concerted substrate processing
is unlikely.
INTRODUCTION
Endonuclease G (EndoG) is a nuclear encoded, sugar-
non-speciﬁc nuclease highly conserved among eukaryotes
(1–3). Bacterial homologues of EndoG have been
described as well, for example in Anabaena and Serratia
marcescens (4,5). The bacterial homologues of EndoG
are secreted from the cell and probably serve a nutritional
function by providing precursors for nucleic acid bio-
synthesis or act as bactericides to inhibit growth of
competing organisms. Related enzymes also serve as vir-
ulence factors during lung infection (6,7). In eukaryotes,
EndoG serves a diﬀerent function. The enzyme was orig-
inally proposed to be involved in mitochondrial DNA rep-
lication (8) and may be involved in the initiation of
genomic inversions in Herpes Simplex type-1 virus (9).
EndoG is targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane
space, and is now thought to be released from
mitochondria upon induction of apoptosis together with
cytochrome c and other proapoptotic proteins (1,3,10–12).
Upon release, EndoG is translocated into the nucleus and
helps to degrade chromosomal DNA (3,12). The role of
EndoG in apoptosis is still ambiguous since an EndoG
knock-out in mice did not show impaired apoptotic
DNA degradation (13,14). However, the lack of apoptotic
DNA degradation might also be explained by redundancy
with additional nucleases (15). The major enzyme respon-
sible for apoptotic DNA degradation is the caspase-
activated DNase (CAD), which is regulated through
association with its inhibitor ICAD. ICAD serves a dual
function: it has a chaperone-like role, since no functional
CAD is produced without ICAD. Moreover, ICAD
functions as an inhibitor for CAD; it is cleaved by
caspases upon induction of apoptosis and thereby
releases activated CAD.
Bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms of pro-
tection against self-antagonizing activity of EndoG-like
nucleases. The activity of the Serratia nuclease depends
on the formation of cystine bonds, which occurs only
during secretion (16). Anabaena possesses a protein inhib-
itor (NuiA) that forms a metal ion bridge to the nuclease
NucA (17). Similarly, cytoplasmatic protein inhibitors for
other secreted nucleases such as pancreatic RNase (18),
barnase (19) or colicin E3 (20) have been described,

suggesting that bacteria as well as eukaryotes have backup
systems to protect cellular nucleic acids from sorting
failures.
An inhibitor of EndoG (EndoGI) is encoded in the
genomes of diﬀerent Drosophila species (21). Most
EndoGI is located in the nucleus, separated from the
mitochondrial EndoG, and has been suggested to act as
life insurance for the cell against stray EndoG produced
by failure of mitochondrial import or leakage from the
organelle. EndoGI binds to EndoG with subpicomolar
aﬃnity, and binding is dependent on the active site archi-
tecture of the nuclease. EndoGI consists of two highly
similar domains linked within one polypeptide chain.
Each domain is able to inhibit EndoG on its own, and,
accordingly, analytical ultracentrifugation showed that
one molecule of EndoGI binds two EndoG molecules
(21). EndoG from Drosophila as well as other EndoG
variants from diﬀerent eukaryotes exist as homodimers
(2,21,22), and each inhibitor domain of EndoGI most
probably binds to the active site of one EndoG
monomer (21).
The active site of EndoG displays a bba-metal ﬁnger
topology, harboring conserved residues involved in
metal ion binding and nuclease activity (2,23). Based on
sequence similarity with related bacterial nucleases,
homology models have been proposed for EndoG.
However, contradicting results concerning the active site
architecture were obtained, requiring structural investi-
gations of EndoG.
We therefore crystallized EndoG from Drosophila
melanogaster in the presence of the inhibitor EndoGI.
For the ﬁrst time, we report the three-dimensional struc-
ture of eukaryotic EndoG. We demonstate that EndoGI
inhibits EndoG by blocking the active site and the
oligonucleotide-binding groove. EndoGI is structurally
unrelated to the previously described nuclease inhibitors
and most probably has evolved independently of any
ancestral bacterial inhibitor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
Full length EndoGI (dEndoGI) and N-terminally
truncated EndoG (lacking the mitochondrial localization
sequence and a short unstructured polypeptide stretch;
further referred to as dEndoG), both from
D.melanogaster, were co-expressed from a bicistronic
expression construct (21). Escherichia coli C43(DE3)
cells (Lucigen) transformed with the bicistronic expression
construct were grown at 310K in LB-medium containing
100mg/l ampicillin to an OD600 of 0.6, cooled to 291K
and protein expression was induced with 0.5mM IPTG
for 16 h. Harvested cells were resuspended in buﬀer A
(50mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 250mM NaCl, 2mM MgSO4
and 10mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Cell walls were broken by
sonication and the cleared supernatant was loaded onto a
1ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with buﬀer A. Proteins were eluted as a complex in a
gradient to buﬀer A containing additional 250mM
imidazole. The dEndoG/dEndoGI complex was further
puriﬁed by size exclusion chromatography on a
SuperdexTM75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with 50mM Hepes–NaOH pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, 2mM
MgSO4 and 2mM dithioerythritol. For crystallization, the
protein complex was concentrated to 17mg/ml as deter-
mined by the BioRad Protein Assay.
For nuclease activity assays, the dEndoG/dEndoGI
complex was incubated with 10mM EDTA and
bound to MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) equili-
brated with buﬀer B (50mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0
and 2mM dithioerythritol) with additional 10mM
EDTA. While dEndoGI bound to the column, dEndoG
was found in the ﬂow-through, which was loaded
onto a 1ml HiTrap Heparin (GE Healthcare) equili-
brated with buﬀer B subsequently. Pure dEndoG was
eluted in a gradient to buﬀer B containing additional
1M NaCl.
Nuclease activity assay
In limited digestion experiments, 7.5 fmol of dEndoG were
incubated with 80 ng plasmid DNA in 30 ml reaction buﬀer
(10mM sodium phosphate buﬀer pH 6.0, 2mM MgSO4
and 2mM dithioerythritol). Aliquots were taken at
diﬀerent time intervals and the reaction was stopped by
addition of 10mM EDTA. To determine the pH-
dependence of dEndoG activity in reaction buﬀer at
diﬀerent pH, the reaction was stopped after 1min incuba-
tion. Samples were electrophoretically separated over a
0.5% (w/v) agarose gel and stained with SYBR Gold
nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen).
Crystallization, crystal harvesting and data collection
Crystals grew at 277K in a vapor diﬀusion setup applying
a reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 2000
MME. Crystals were harvested into a cryo protectant
solution containing 100mM Tris–HCl pH 8.5 and 32%
(v/v) PEG 400 and subsequently ﬂash cooled in liquid
nitrogen. Diﬀraction data were collected at the beamline
X10SA at the Swiss Light Source (Switzerland) at 100K
and processed with XDS (24).
Phasing and structure reﬁnement
Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement
(25) using the structure of NucA (26). Model building was
performed in cycles of manual building with COOT (27)
and automatic reﬁnement using the simulated annealing
protocol from CNS (28) and REFMAC (29). At ﬁnal
stages of reﬁnement, phases were improved with
REFMAC using TLS reﬁnement. Model quality was
evaluated with PROCHECK (30) and MolProbity (31).
Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated with
AREAIMOL (29). Figures were prepared using PYMOL
(32), and electrostatic surface potentials were calcu-
lated with APBS (33). Sequence alignments were
performed with CLUSTALW (34) and illustrated with
ALSCRIPT (35).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure of the EndoG/EndoGI complex
A model of the dEndoG/dEndoGI complex was reﬁned
against diﬀraction data to 2.2 A˚ resolution (data
and reﬁnement statistics are given in Table 1). Although
some parts of the model were missing (see Supplementary
Table S1), the model could be reﬁned to a free R-factor of
22.3%. Overall the model has excellent stereochemistry
with 91.5% of the residues lying in the most favored
regions of the Ramachandran plot and 8% of the
residues in additional allowed regions.
In agreement with previous studies (21), two dEndoG
molecules are bound by one dEndoGI molecule in the
crystal structure (Figure 1). The two dEndoG molecules
form a compact dimer and are sandwiched between two
domains of dEndoGI (further referred to as Dom1 and
Dom2). The linker connecting the two inhibitor domains,
however, could not be modeled into the residual ambigu-
ous electron density. Thus, the physical connection of the
two domains remains elusive (Supplementary Table S1).
The termini of the two domains that need to be connected
are separated by 65 A˚, a distance that could easily be
spanned by the missing 44 residues. Consequently, one
dEndoGI molecule can inhibit both nuclease domains,
without steric interference of the homodimer arrange-
ment of dEndoG. Finally, MALDI-TOF experiments
performed on dissolved protein crystals revealed that the
EndoGI polypeptide chain was intact. Proteolytic
cleavage of dEndoGI into two separate domains can
therefore be excluded.
Architecture of homodimeric EndoG
A Dali search (36) revealed that the mixed ab fold of
dEndoG closely resembles NucA from Anabaena (26)
and Serratia nuclease (37). Like the related bacterial
endonucleases, dEndoG contains a central twisted
antiparallel b-sheet consisting of six b-strands ﬂanked by
helices and a second short b-sheet formed by strands bD
and bE. In contrast to the bacterial nucleases, strands bG
and bH of dEndoG form a third, small two-stranded
antiparallel b-sheet (wing) which protrudes from the
globular domain (Figures 1 and 2A). Interestingly, the
wings of both monomers dimerize and form an
intermolecular b-sheet. Additional residues in adjacent
loop regions contribute to dimer formation (Figure 2A
and Supplementary Table S2), and the total buried
surface area involved in dimer formation is 1600 A˚2,
7.5% of the total solvent accessible surface. The domain
interface is mainly hydrophilic, and two cavities ﬁlled with
water molecules are buried in the domain interface. A
superposition of the two dEndoG molecules revealed no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences, and root-mean-square deviation
(r.m.s.d.) of 0.39 A˚ for all main chain atoms was
calculated when the ﬁrst six amino-terminal residues
were excluded.
Residues forming the dEndoG dimer interface are
conserved from yeast to human (Figure 2A and B). The
dimer observed for dEndoG is thus a valid model for
eukaryotic EndoG in general. This agrees with previous
reports showing that EndoG from diﬀerent organisms
exists as homodimers in vitro (2,21,22). Based on the
sequence homology to the Serratia nuclease, a diﬀerent
mode of dimer formation has been proposed (2).
However, the b-wing forming the intermolecular b-sheet
is not present in related bacterial endonucleases, and thus
bacterial Serratia nuclease dimer formation is diﬀerent.
The wing was probably inserted later during evolution;
it is conserved throughout all eukaryotic EndoG
variants (Figure 2A).
The active site of EndoG is highly conserved
An additional conserved patch is located at the surface of
dEndoG, opposite the dimer interface, where a hydrated
magnesium ion is bound (Figure 2B and C). Mutational
studies suggested that the highly conserved DRGH motif
located in this conserved patch (spanning Asp152 to
His155 in dEndoG) is involved in both metal ion and
oligonucleotide binding and thus is the key motif for catal-
ysis (2,23). A histidine residue was proposed to activate
water breakage of the phosphodiester bond. Indeed, in the
crystal structure, the Ne of His155 forms a hydrogen bond
to water molecule 2 belonging to the ﬁrst hydration shell
of the magnesium ion (Figure 2C). Four additional water
molecules are involved in the coordination of the catalytic
metal ion: water molecule 3 forms a hydrogen bond to the
side chain carbonyl function of Gln181 and both water
molecules 4 and 5 are held in place by the carboxylate
group of Glu195. Only water molecule 6 is not contacted
by the protein moiety and is solvent exposed. A single
bond between the protein and the metal ion is formed

(Figure 2C).
In addition to residues involved in metal ion bind-
ing and activation of a water molecule, Arg57 of the
Serratia nuclease was proposed to be required for catalysis
by neutralizing the extra negative charge on the phosphate
group in the transition state (38). However, a cysteine
residue is located at the equivalent position in the
sequences of dEndoG and its mammalian homologues.
Mutation of this cysteine residue in bovine EndoG did
not result in nuclease inactivation (2), suggesting that
this residue is not involved in the transition state. The
loop region harboring these residues is substantially dif-
ferent in the dEndoG and Serratia nuclease structures.
A conserved arginine residue (Arg124 in dEndoG) is
located further downstream in the sequences of diﬀerent
EndoG homologues and is placed in the active site of
dEndoG at a similar position as observed for Arg57 the
Serratia nuclease (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure
S1). Mutation of this arginine residue in human EndoG
impairs nuclease activity (23), and thus Arg124 is
probably involved in formation of the transition state
in dEndoG.
Intriguingly, the active site of dEndoG contains several
additional water molecules (Figure 2C) that are also found
in the Serratia nuclease and NucA at equivalent positions
(Supplementary Figure S1). It is tempting to speculate
that these water molecules occupy positions where the
phosphate backbone of the substrate is bound and that
the eukaryotic and bacterial homologues share not only a
highly conserved catalytic mechanism but also a conserved
mode of oligonucleotide binding.
Furthermore, residues involved in the formation of the
overall architecture of the active site are conserved in
eukaryotic and bacterial endonucleases. Most prominent
is Asp152 in dEndoG, located in the DRGH motif. One
oxygen atom of the carboxylate group is the acceptor
for a hydrogen bond from the amide of the side chain
of Asn187, which binds to the metal ion (Figure 2C).
Mutation of this aspartate residue to alanine in bovine
EndoG impaired nuclease activity (2). The human
EXOG homologue contains a serine residue at the equiv-
alent position in the amino acid sequence, and a replace-
ment by asparate apparently does not inﬂuence the
activity (39). In silico mutation of Asp152 to serine in
dEndoG revealed that this mutation can establish a

similar hydrogen bond pattern, and thus the active site
conﬁguration is probably maintained.
Contradicting proposals for residues that bind metal
ions have been made previously, and the residue equiva-
lent to Glu286 in dEndoG was proposed to be involved in
coordination of a second metal binding site in the human
homologue (23). However, Glu286 forms a salt bridge
within the homodimer interface, and no additional metal
ion could be identiﬁed although 2mM Mg2+ was present
in the crystallization setup. Thus Glu286 is more likely a
structural residue and not directly involved in metal ion
cofactor binding and catalysis.
The oligonucleotide-binding site of EndoG
Conserved surface exposed residues cluster and line a pos-
itively charged groove around the metal ion binding site
(Figures 2B and 3). A superposition of dEndoG with the
related bba-metal ﬁnger nuclease Vvn bound to DNA (40)
reveals that residues lining this positively charged groove
are probably involved in oligonucleotide binding. The
majority of them are arginine residues (Arg124, Arg153
of the DRGH motif, Arg163 and Arg199) with their
guanidinium groups lining the central part of the posi-
tively charged groove. Additional positively charged
residues more distal from the active site extend this

putative oligonucleotide-binding site to 30 A˚ in its longest
dimension.
The two oligonucleotide-binding grooves of EndoG are
at opposing sides of the homodimer and do not form an
extended intermolecular oligonucleotide-binding site
(Figure 1). This corresponds to the active site arrangement
in the Serratia nuclease even though the mechanism of
dimerization diﬀers. Given the distance and orientation
of the two active sites, they cannot bind to and process
double-stranded oligonucleotides simultaneously without
dramatic bending of the double strand. It is more likely
that the two active sites process substrates independently
of each other. Such an independent mechanism is further
supported by our observation that in the crystal structure
the two monomers are identical and a cooperative
action of the individual active sites seems rather
unlikely. Finally, limited digestion of supercoiled (sc)
plasmid DNA by dEndoG primarily produced open
closed (oc) intermediates (Figure 4). Denaturation of
these samples revealed that both strands had accumulated
a large number of cuts; unit length DNA strands were not
visible. This is inconsistent with the two active sites
making two concerted, closely spaced cuts in both
strands, as this would result in linearization of the DNA
without oc intermediates. Thus, the enzyme seems to cut
stochastically within the two strands, and linearization
does not result until independent cuts in the complemen-
tary strands are suﬃciently close together that base
pairing can no longer maintain the double-stranded struc-
ture. Similar to bovine EndoG (2), dEndoG has optimal
activity around pH 6.0 (Figure 4C). Notably, at pH 7.0 or
higher the amount of short intermediates is reduced and
both the oc and linearized form accumulate. Thus,
dEndoG seems to function diﬀerently than the related
bacterial Serratia nuclease, which does not produce an
oc form of plasmid DNA (41). As the ﬁnal oligonucleotide
products of dEndoG only accumulate upon longer incu-
bation, they are also derived from random cutting, i.e.
the two active sites in one homodimer do not cut
simultaneously within one stand and do not act as
molecular rulers.
Overall structure of dEndoGI
Each domain of dEndoGI is composed of a-helix bundles
forming the hydrophobic core, which is sealed by an
N-terminal lid helix and a C-terminal extension almost
totally lacking secondary structure elements (Figure 1
and Supplementary Figure S2). The two domains are
homologous to each other and are also highly conserved
among diﬀerent Drosophila species (Supplementary Figure
S2). In contrast, the ﬂexible linker connecting the two
domains is less well conserved. The solenoid fold of each
domain is reminiscent of that of HEAT repeats. Dom1
and Dom2 are structurally very similar: a superposition
revealed an r.m.s.d. of only 1.0 A˚ for all main chain atoms,
neglecting a loop region distal from the nuclease binding
site (residues 78–81 in Dom1 and 264–266 in Dom2).
This loop region diﬀers in length and geometry of the
polypeptide chain.
A DALI search of Dom1 and Dom2 (36) revealed that
the structurally most closely related domain is the C-
terminal domain of the ATP-dependent helicase Ku80
(42). Based on its solenoid fold, this domain has been
proposed to be involved in protein–protein interactions.
Although there is no obvious reason to suspect a func-
tional connection of dEndoGI and Ku80, we note that
Ku80 was also identiﬁed in an amino acid sequence
search when the sequence of Dom1 was used as query.
Further structurally related proteins are the subunit
VPS35 of the cargo-recognition complex (43), a yeast
importin b (44).
The inhibitor of the bacterial EndoG homologue NucA,
NuiA, has a distinctly diﬀerent fold, containing a central
b-sheet ﬂanked by helices (17,45). Thus, dEndoGI has
probably evolved from a protein-protein interaction
module independently of NuiA. Although not structurally
related to dEndoGI, the pancreatic RNase inhibitor is also
composed of tandem repeats. In the case of the RNase
inhibitor, leucine-rich repeats form a horseshoe like archi-
tecture (18). Apparently, dEndoG and pancreatic RNase
inhibitor have evolved from diﬀerent protein–protein
interaction modules that have adapted to become tight
binders and, eventually, inhibitors.
Inhibition of dEndoG by dEndoGI
One of the ridges formed by loop regions connecting the
a-helix repeats of dEndoGI is rich in acidic residues which
form a highly negatively charged patch at the molecular
surface of Dom1 and Dom2 (Figure 3). These negatively
charged surface patches seal the putative oligonucleotide-
binding groove of each dEndoG monomer by electrostatic
interactions. Each domain covers roughly 6% of the
entire dEndoG dimer surface. A plethora of salt bridges
are formed between carboxylate groups from the ridge
of dEndoGI to guanidinium groups of dEndoG
(Supplementary Table S3). Thus, dEndoGI not only
forms a simple antipole that binds the positively charged
oligonucleotide-binding grooves; rather, the negatively
charged side chains are likely to mimic the phosphate

groups of the oligonucleotide substrate. Indeed, a
superposition of dEndoG with the Vvn nuclease bound
to DNA (40) showed that the position of active site
proximal carboxylate groups of the two domains of
dEndoGI superimpose with the phosphate groups of the
DNA in the Vvn structure (Supplementary Figure S3).
This observation not only could serve as a guide for
docking an oligonucleotide substrate to EndoG, but also
the structure of the dEndoG/dEndoGI complex could
serve as a starting point for the de novo design of inhibitors
for this type of nucleases, similarly as recently suggested
for the Anabaena NucA/NuiA complex (17).
Another feature in common to the inhibitory actions of
dEndoGI and NuiA is that both inhibitors are involved in
metal ion coordination. Whereas dEndoGI blocks access
to the active site by binding to a water molecule of the
metal ion hydration shell (Figure 5), the C-terminal
residue of NuiA displaces a water molecule from the
hydration shell of the metal ion and establishes a direct
metal ion bridge (17). Binding to the two active sites is
likely the key determinant for the aﬃnity of dEndoGI to
dEndoG, since chelating the metal ion cofactor leads to
disassembly of the otherwise stable dEndoGI/dEndoG
complex (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). Further
support for this comes from previous mutational studies
showing that mutation of the metal ion coordinating
Asn187 in dEndoG (Figure 5) impaired binding of
dEndoGI (21). Finally, the latter report described that
mutation of the DRGH motif to DAGA totally abolished
binding of dEndoG to dEndoGI, supporting that addi-
tional salt bridges formed between carboxylate groups of
dEndoGI (Asp145 in Dom1 and Asp330 in Dom2) and
Arg153 of each dEndoG (Figure 5) signiﬁcantly contribute
to aﬃnity. Further salt bridges are formed between the
carboxylate group of Asp151 in Dom1 and Asp336 in
Dom2 to the guanidinium group of Arg124 of dEndoG,
which is presumably involved in the formation of the tran-
sition state.
When Dom1 and Dom2 are compared, striking
diﬀerences in binding to the hydrated metal ion (Figure
5) are observed. In Dom1, a solvent water molecule is
sandwiched between the carboxylate group of Asp148
and the solvent exposed water molecule from the metal
ion hydration shell. In a bifurcated manner, this water
molecule binds a second, additional solvent water
molecule which in turn forms a hydrogen bond to the
carbonyl group of Phe147 (Figure 5A). In contrast, in
Dom2 the side chain of Asp333 forms a direct hydrogen
bond to the respective water molecule coordinating the
metal ion (Figure 5B). These diﬀerences may contribute
to the observed diﬀerences in the reported aﬃnity of the
separated domains for dEndoG where Dom2 binds with
higher aﬃnity to dEndoG than Dom1 does (21).
Figure 5. Inhibition of the active site of dEndoG by dEndoGI. The
interface between Dom1 of dEndoGI (brown) and the active site of one
dEndoG monomer (violet) is shown in (A) and the equivalent interface
between Dom2 and the second dEndoG molecule in (B). Residues
involved in binding are shown as sticks and for simplicity only salt
bridges of important arginine residues (dotted black lines) and
hydrogen bonds to water molecules (dashed black lines) are presented.

An additional diﬀerence between Dom1 and Dom2
binding dEndoG is the hydrophobic interaction between
Leu146 of Dom1, respectively Tyr331 in Dom2, and
Phe129 of dEndoG. Whereas the aromatic ring system
in Dom2 (Tyr331) makes a hydrophobic stacking interac-
tion with the side chain of Phe129, the side chain of
Leu129 in Dom1 shows alternative conformations and
apparently is ﬂexible. This seems to be a general diﬀerence
in EndoGI from diﬀerent species, since Leu129 is strictly
conserved in Dom1 and at the position equivalent to
Tyr331 the aromatic side chain character is maintained
in Dom2 (Supplementary Figure S1). Additional minor
diﬀerences in binding of Dom1 or Dom2 of dEndoGI to
dEndoG were observed and are listed in Supplementary
Table S3.
CONCLUSIONS
Eukaryotic apoptotic endonuclease G and the related bac-
terial endonucleases share a conserved active site and
oligonucleotide-binding groove. Similarly to the related
bacterial Serratia nuclease, EndoG is a homodimeric
protein, although the mode of dimerization diﬀers. The
Drosophila inhibitor EndoGI is composed of two highly
conserved domains that are linked by a ﬂexible and non-
conserved polypeptide stretch (Supplementary Figure S1).
The crystal structure revealed that each domain blocks
the active site of one subunit in the dEndoG dimer and
seals the oligonucleotide-binding groove. However, struc-
tural diﬀerences are found between the two domains,
and Dom1 binds less tightly to one dEndoG monomer.
Intriguingly, this domain shows a higher degree of amino
acid sequence conservation when compared with Dom2
(Supplementary Figure S1). It seems plausible that
Dom1 of EndoGI might serve additional functions
which lead to the observed sequence conservation.
Another possible explanation could be that the amino
acid sequence variation of Dom2 between diﬀerent
Drosophila homologues serves a species-speciﬁc adaption
and represents a modulation of tight binding, since Dom2
binds to dEndoG with higher aﬃnity than Dom1 (21).
Each domain of dEndoGI is composed of HEAT
repeats; dEndoGI apparently originated from a protein-
protein interaction module that eventually was trans-
formed into an inhibitor. Many traﬃcking proteins are
composed of HEAT repeats, with some of the most
closely related structural homologues of the dEndoGI
domains involved in these processes. Notably, importin
b which was shown to be involved in EndoG translocation
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3), is structurally related to
dEndoGI. So far, EndoGI homologues have only been
identiﬁed in various Drosophila species (21). It remains
to be seen whether inhibitors of EndoG also exist in
other eukaryotes. Common bioinformatic tools may fail
to identify EndoGI homologues solely based on amino
acid sequence alignments, since HEAT repeat proteins
show weak sequence conservation, and most conserved
residues lead to a common hydrophobic core (46). Thus,
the structure presented serves as a starting point for a
structure based search for EndoGI homologues in other
eukaryotic organisms.
