ABSTRACT
Despite the known existence of distant-acting cis-
regulatory elements in the human genome, only a
small fraction of these elements has been identified
and experimentally characterized in vivo. This
paucity of enhancer collections with defined activ-
ities has thus hindered computational approaches
for the genome-wide prediction of enhancers and
their functions. To fill this void, we utilize compara-
tive genome analysis to identify candidate enhancer
elements in the human genome coupled with the
experimental determination of their in vivo enhancer
activity in transgenic mice [L. A. Pennacchio et al.
(2006) Nature, in press]. These data are available
through the VISTA Enhancer Browser (http://
enhancer.lbl.gov). This growing database currently
contains over 250 experimentally tested DNA frag-
ments, of which more than 100 have been validated
as tissue-specific enhancers. For each positive
enhancer, we provide digital images of whole-
mount embryo staining at embryonic day 11.5 and
an anatomical description of the reporter gene ex-
pression pattern. Users can retrieve elements near
single genes of interest, search for enhancers that
target reporter gene expression to a particular
tissue, or download entire collections of enhancers
with a defined tissue specificity or conservation
depth. These experimentally validated training sets
are expected to provide a basis for a wide range of
downstream computational and functional studies
of enhancer function.
INTRODUCTION
The availability of the human genome sequence and large
cDNA datasets, combined with efficient gene prediction meth-
ods, has led to a virtually complete list of human genes and the
proteins they encode (1–4). In sharp contrast, our knowledge
about the location and function of cis-regulatory elements,
and in particular those of distant-acting enhancers, has been
mostly confined to the results of gene-centric investigations.
The most efficient computational enhancer prediction
methods available to date are based on the observation that
cis-regulatory elements are often highly constrained and can
therefore be identified by their conservation across evolution-
ary distant species. For instance, a systematic search for such
conserved non-coding elements was successfully used to
identify enhancers in a gene-sparse region of the human gen-
ome (5). With the availability of whole genome sequences for
a growing number of vertebrates and the concurrent emer-
gence of advanced comparative genomic tools (6,7), it is
now possible to predict the location of candidate enhancers
on a genome-wide scale with a specificity that makes their
characterization by in vivo assays feasible. Such experimental
testing requires considerable resources due to the laborious
nature of the relevant functional assays. This applies espe-
cially to transgenic methods to analyze the in vivo activity
of developmental enhancers. Yet, there is a pressing need
for sets of enhancers with experimentally defined tissue-
specific activity because these will likely be required to
develop computational methods aimed at prediction of
enhancer function. To be accessible and useful for such
downstream applications, it is imperative that functional
in vivo datasets are generated with standardized methodology
and described by a consistent functional annotation. We have
therefore established the VISTA Enhancer Browser as a pub-
lic resource to provide access to conserved sequence elements
tested for enhancer activity. The database contains results for
hundreds of human candidate regions identified by compara-
tive genomics and assayed in our own laboratory (5,8), as
well as similar data from other laboratories. The purpose of
this database is to provide a centralized resource for in vivo
enhancer data that allows systematic mining both for
gene-centric and genomic studies.

and non-mammalian vertebrates across long (chicken and
frog) or extremely long (pufferfish and zebrafish) evolution-
ary distances or by their unusually high conservation
among mammals, such as ‘ultra’-conservation [100% identity
for at least 200 bp between human, mouse and rat (9)]. The
conservation properties of the currently available elements
are summarized in Table 1. For more details on the experi-
mental dataset, see Ref. 8.
The transgenic mouse assay used to determine the tissue
specificity of putative enhancers has been previously
described in several publications (5,8,10). Briefly, candidate
elements, typically ranging in size between 200 bp and
2 kb, are amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned
upstream of a heat shock protein 68 (Hsp68) promoter and
a LacZ reporter gene. Importantly, the Hsp68 promoter
alone lacks activity in embryonic mouse tissues (10), but
drives reporter gene expression efficiently when coupled to
tissue-specific enhancers. The reporter construct is linearized
and injected into fertilized mouse oocytes, which are then
reimplanted into pseudopregnant females. Embryos are col-
lected on embryonic day (E) 11.5, embryo sacs are removed
for genotyping and the embryos are stained for LacZ reporter
gene activity (8). Note that each of these founder embryos is
the result of an independent oocyte injection. Transgenic
embryos can therefore be expected to carry the reporter
construct stably integrated into their genome at different
(random) positions. Thus, comparison of several independent
transgenic embryos allows one to identify cases of expression
due to positional effects (i.e. their integration near endoge-
nous regulatory elements), which typically result in reporter
activity patterns that are observed only in a single embryo
out of the numerous additional transgenic animals generated
in the experiment.
Elements that show consistent reporter gene expression
among at least three embryos are defined as positive
enhancers, whereas elements for which no reproducible pat-
tern has been observed among a minimum of five transgenic
embryos are defined as negative. It is worth noting that nega-
tives at E11.5 do not rule out the possibility that these
sequences are enhancers at other time points or physiological
conditions or that their activity depends on the presence of
additional cis-regulatory elements.
The tissue specificities of positive enhancers are annotated
using terms that are largely consistent with the standardized
nomenclature for mouse developmental anatomy (11). The
reproducibility of positive enhancers is determined separately
for each anatomical structure and reported in the database
together with the total number of transgenic embryos
obtained for each element. Thus, the reproducibility of the
enhancer activity is quantified. For instance, many enhancers
result in the same staining pattern in nearly all of 10 or more
transgenic embryos generated, thereby indicating that they
drive expression in a particular tissue very robustly and
largely independent of their integration site in the genome.
Computational dataset
While the primary purpose of the VISTA Enhancer Browser
is to provide a centralized resource for experimental data, it
also contains a genome-wide computationally generated set
of more than 145 000 conserved noncoding sequences.
These elements were identified based on their highly signifi-
cant (P < 0.001) conservation between human, mouse and rat
(6) and subsequently analyzed for conservation in chicken,
frog, zebrafish and fugu to determine their conservation
depth.
We plan to test subsets of these highly conserved elements
in the future to further explore tradeoffs in enhancer identi-
fication success rates based on differing evolutionary conser-
vation criteria. The major purpose of the computational
dataset is, however, to provide users with lists of candidate
enhancers that are easily accessible through the same inter-
face as the experimental data and can be queried in an analo-
gous way. The computational dataset is similar to those
obtained by other comparative methods. Complementary
and partially overlapping sets of highly conserved elements
are, e.g. available through the VISTA Genome Browser
(12), the UCSC Genome Browser (13) and the Dcode ECR
Browser (14). Moreover, several web resources are available
that utilize motif-based methods to predict the location of
cis-regulatory elements in vertebrate genomes (15–17) and
can be useful to further prioritize elements in a genome
region of interest.
Data deposition by external users
The majority of experimental datasets that are currently
available have been specifically generated for the VISTA
Enhancer Browser (8). However, we plan to incorporate
increasing amounts of published and unpublished experi-
mental data generated by other laboratories using this lacZ-
based enhancer assay in transgenic mice. These results will
be available through the same interface as the in-house
generated data in order to facilitate comparison of the differ-
ent datasets. A software client for the upload of experimental
in vivo data to this database is available from the authors
upon request.
DATA RETRIEVAL
Datasets
Each dataset in the VISTA Enhancer Browser consists of
sequence-related information and, for experimentally tested
positive elements, image data and information about
enhancer tissue specificity (Figure 1).
Sequence-related information includes the coordinates,
the nucleotide sequence, the PCR primers used to amplify
the fragment, the names of neighboring genes, and
comparative information about the conservation depth of
each element (Figure 1; see on-line user manual for defini-
tions of conservation depth). For experimentally tested
elements with reproducible enhancer activity, images of one

shown in an overview image and, where appropriate, higher-
magnification images of details of interest are provided.
Moreover, the tissue specificity of reporter gene expression
is presented, indicating the reproducibility separately for
each anatomical structure.
Queries
Simple queries for elements in a genomic interval of interest
can be initiated from the front page at http://enhancer.lbl.gov
using gene symbols, accession numbers or coordinates. By
default these searches are limited to elements for which
experimental data are available. In the ‘Computational
Dataset’ section of the database, the much larger dataset of
predicted enhancers without experimental data can also be
searched in a similar fashion.
Additional search options for the experimental dataset are
available in the ‘advanced query’ form. Since the expression
patterns of all positive enhancers are annotated, it is possible
to retrieve sets of enhancers that drive expression in certain
anatomical regions or tissues (Figure 2). Checking more
than one anatomical term in the query form will retrieve
all elements that drive expression in any of the selected
structures. In addition, the search can be limited to elements
of a user-defined conservation depth. It is also possible to
retrieve only elements that have no reproducible enhancer
activity. When using this feature, keep in mind that
the assay captures only a single developmental time-point
and a negative result does not exclude the possibility that

development.
Bulk downloads
The results of all queries are displayed in a table format that
includes the coordinates and conservation depth (Figure 2). It
is also possible to download all sequences of the elements
retrieved by a query as a bulk sequence file in FASTA format
using the ‘download’ function at the bottom of each query
result. The title line for each sequence includes information
if the respective element was positive or negative at E11.5.
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
The VISTA Enhancer Browser runs on a Linux platform with
mySQL 3.23 as the database engine. The web interface was
developed in Perl using ImageMagick (http://www.
imagemagick.org), HTML::Template (http://html-template.
sourceforge.net) and overLIB (http://www.bosrup.com/web/
overlib/) libraries. It runs as a CGI script under the Apache
web server. All images are stored in two different resolutions
(medium-sized preview and full resolution) in the file system.
The web server and all parts of the database are hosted at
E.O. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley,
CA, USA.
AVAILABILITY
The VISTA Enhancer Browser is available to the scientific
community at http://enhancer.lbl.gov. Using the web site
and database is free and does not require registration.
In-house generated datasets are added to the database
continuously and are generally released in batches as soon
as the experimental data and anatomical annotations are
available. When using data retrieved from this website (e.g.
sets of tissue-specific enhancers) for downstream computa-
tional applications, please cite this article or Ref. 8. If you
would like to use any of the image data in publications,
please contact the authors to obtain copyright.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We have established an integrated database for functional
in vivo data of human tissue-specific enhancers. The purpose

of this database is to facilitate public access to a large and
consistent dataset of such enhancers both for experimental
and computational biologists. Candidate noncoding regions
for experimental testing are identified based on their conser-
vation between the human and other vertebrate genomes.
We plan to add several hundred in-house generated datasets
per year to this resource. Future goals for the VISTA
Enhancer Browser include improving the interoperability
with other resources and extending the tools for deposition
and searching of datasets submitted by external users in
order to maximize its value as a centralized resource for
in vivo enhancer data.
