ABSTRACT
IMGT/LIGM-DB is the IMGT comprehensivedatabase
of immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) nuc-
leotide sequences from human and other vertebrate
species. It was created in 1989 by LIGM, Montpellier,
France and is the oldest and the largest data-
base of IMGT. IMGT/LIGM-DB includes all germline
(non-rearranged) and rearranged IG and TR genomic
DNA (gDNA) and complementary DNA (cDNA)
sequences published in generalist databases.
IMGT/LIGM-DB allows searches from the Web
interface according to biological and immunogenetic
criteria through five distinct modules depending on
the user interest. For a given entry, nine types of
display are available including the IMGT flat file, the
translation of the coding regions and the analysis
by the IMGT/V-QUEST tool. IMGT/LIGM-DB distrib-
utes expertly annotated sequences. The annotations
hugely enhance the quality and the accuracy of
the distributed detailed information. They include
the sequence identification, the gene and allele
classification, the constitutive and specific motif
description, the codon and amino acid numbering,
and the sequence obtaining information, accord-
ing to the main concepts of IMGT-ONTOLOGY. They
represent the main source of IG and TR gene and
allele knowledge stored in IMGT/GENE-DB and in
the IMGT reference directory. IMGT/LIGM-DB is freely
available at http://imgt.cines.fr.
INTRODUCTION
IMGT/LIGM-DB is the comprehensive IMGT database of
immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) nucleotide
sequences from human and other vertebrate species, created
in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc, LIGM, Montpellier, France,
on the Web since July 1995 (1–3). IMGT/LIGM-DB is the first
and the largest database of IMGT, the international ImMuno-
GeneTics information system (4,5). It provides standardized
and detailed immunogenetics annotations.
Owing to the complexity of the IG and TR molecular gen-
etics (6,7) that is unique to the vertebrate genomes, IMGT/
LIGM-DB has to deal with (i) large germline (non-rearranged)
genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences, which may involve a
complete locus from several hundred kilobases to one (or
more) megabase(s); (ii) rearranged gDNA sequences resulting
from the recombination of V (variable), D (diversity) and
J (joining) genes (V-J genes and V-D-J genes); and
(iii) rearranged V-J-C (constant) and V-D-J-C complementary
DNA (cDNA designated as ‘mRNA’ in generalist databases)
sequences. The complexity is further enhanced by the char-
acteristics of the loci and chain types in the different species
(reviewed in the IMGT Repertoire) and by the mechanisms
of diversity such as combinatorial diversity, N diversity,
somatic hypermutation and gene conversion (6,7). Thus, the
detailed sequence annotation is a huge and complex task which
requires the interpretation of DNA rearrangements and
recombination, of sequence polymorphisms, of nucleotide
deletions and insertions at the V-J and V-D-J junctions and,
for IG, of somatic hypermutations (6,7). Annotations rely on
the accuracy and the coherence of IMGT-ONTOLOGY (8),
the first ontology in the field of immunogenetics which
has allowed to set up the rules for standardized sequence

stitutive and specific motif description, amino acid numbering
(10–13) and sequence obtaining information.
IMGT/LIGM-DB DATA SOURCE AND CONTENT
The unique source of IMGT/LIGM-DB nucleotide sequences
is EMBL (14). Prior to being entered in IMGT/LIGM-DB, IG
and TR sequences must be submitted to EMBL, GenBank or
DDBJ, in order to get a unique accession number which is also
the entry identifier in IMGT/LIGM-DB. Then, EMBL auto-
matically sends the IG and TR sequences (new entries and
updates) to LIGM. Sequences belonging to the human (HUM),
mouse (MUS), primate (PRI), other mammals (MAM)
and vertebrate (VRT) divisions, which are sufficiently reliable,
are managed in IMGT/LIGM-DB, plus IG and TR-related
sequences from synthetic (SYN) and unclassified (UNC).
The sequences from the other EMBL divisions (CON,
GSS, HTG, HTC, STS and EST) are not included. The new
sequences and updates received at LIGM represent >700
sequences a week. In November 2005, IMGT/LIGM-DB

contains 98 800 sequences from 150 vertebrate species. They
comprise germline gDNA, rearranged gDNA, a few germline
cDNA and, for the half of the database content, rearranged
cDNA (or ‘mRNA’). Almost three quarters of the sequences
are from human and mouse.
IMGT/LIGM-DB ANNOTATIONS
At the reception at LIGM, data are checked by LIGM curators
for their relevance. Data are then scanned to store sequences,
bibliographical references and taxonomic data, whereas stand-
ardized IMGT/LIGM-DB keywords are assigned mainly
manually. Based on expert analysis, specific detailed annota-
tions are added in a second step. They follow the concepts of
IMGT-ONTOLOGY (8) and the rules of the IMGT Scientific
chart (9). This allows, for example for the sequence shown in
Figure 1, the precise sequence identification with the charac-
terization of the nature of the molecule, the configuration, the
structure, the functionality, the species, the chain type and the
gene type (IDENTIFICATION concept), the characterization
of the group and subgroup, and the classification of the gene
and allele according to the IMGT nomenclature (CLASSI-
FICATION concept) (15), the description of the constitutive
immunogenetics specific motifs (DESCRIPTION concept),
the codon and amino acid numbering (NUMEROTATION
concept), and the sequence obtaining information (OBTEN-
TION concept, currently in development, with an important
analysis devoted to the biological origin of the sequence, the
clinical specification and the description of used methodo-
logy). Most of the annotations are manually performed with
the help of IMGT tools, IMGT/V-QUEST (16) and IMGT/
JunctionAnalysis (17). However, a part of human and mouse
cDNA sequences have been automatically annotated by the
internal tool IMGT/Automat (18,19).
IMGT/LIGM-DB SEARCH AND DISPLAY
The IMGT/LIGM-DB data are provided with a user-friendly
interface. The Web interface allows searches according to
immunogenetic-specific criteria and is easy to use without
any knowledge in a computing language. The interface allows
the users to get easily connected from any type of platform
using free browsers. All IMGT/LIGM-DB information is
available through five modules of search: Catalogue, Tax-
onomy and Characteristics, Keywords, Annotation labels
and References. Selection is displayed at the top of the ‘results
of your search’ page, so the users can check their own queries
(20). Users have the possibility to modify their request or to
consult the results. They can (i) add new conditions to increase
or decrease the number of resulting sequences; (ii) view
details: selecting this ‘View’ option provides a list of resulting
sequences; selection of one sequence in the list offers nine
possibilities: annotations, IMGT flat file, coding regions with
protein translation, catalogue and external references,
sequence in dump format, sequence in FASTA format,
sequence with three reading frames, EMBL flat file, IMGT/
V-QUEST (16); or (iii) search for sequence fragments: select-
ing this ‘Subsequences’ option allows to search for sequence
fragments (subsequences) corresponding to a particular label
for the resulting sequences (available for fully annotated
sequences) (20).
IMGT/LIGM-DB DISTRIBUTION
IMGT/LIGM-DB flatfiles are available by anonymous FTP
servers at CINES (ftp://ftp.cines.fr/IMGT/), at EBI (ftp://ftp.
ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/imgt/), and at IGH (ftp://ftp.igh.cnrs.
fr/pub/IMGT/) and from many SRS (Sequence Retrieval Sys-
tem) sites. IMGT/LIGM-DB can be searched by BLAST or
FASTA on different servers (e.g. CINES, EBI, INFOBIOGEN
and Institut Pasteur). IMGT/LIGM-DB data can also be
retrieved through Web services which are developed and
implemented with Axis (5). For instance, they include the
‘queryKnowledge’ which provides the lists of instances for
the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts, and the ‘querySeqData’
which allows the retrieval of any sequence-related data, iden-
tified, classified, described according to the IMGT concepts,
such as the nucleotide sequence, the description labels, the
literature references, the metadata, etc. The result is then a list
of data entries, in IMGT-ML format, sharing these given
values (5). IMGT/LIGM-DB data are cross-referenced in
the EMBL databank (14), in IMGT/GENE-DB (15) which
allows to link gene entries with the corresponding genomic
reference sequences and with the known expressed cDNAs,
and in IMGT/PRIMER-DB (21) in order to display the
oligonucleotide primers within the sequences.
CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
IMGT/LIGM-DB manages all published vertebrate IG and
TR nucleotide sequences. Very interestingly and despite the
complexity of these sequences, and their variability in
many species (sequences of 150 species are dealt in IMGT/
LIGM-DB), the detailed annotations are all performed accord-
ing to the concepts of IMGT-ONTOLOGY. The organization
of the concepts has been formalized, with XML Schema, in
IMGT-ML (5). A new IMGT/LIGM-DB interface, available
in 2006, will allow queries according to these concepts and
the retrieval of entries as XML files, in IMGT-ML format.
