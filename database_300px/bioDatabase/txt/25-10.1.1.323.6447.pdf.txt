ABSTRACT
A minimally addressed area in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae research is the mapping of transcription
start sites (TSS). Mapping of TSS in S.cerevisiae
has the potential to contribute to our understanding
of gene regulation, transcription, mRNA stability and
aspects of RNA biology. Here, we use 50 SAGE to map
50 TSS in S.cerevisiae. Tags identifying the first 15–17
bases of the transcripts are created, ligated to form
ditags, amplified, concatemerized and ligated into a
vector to create a library. Each clone sequenced from
this library identifies 10–20 TSS. We have identified
13 746 unique, unambiguous sequence tags from
2231 S.cerevisiae genes. TSS identified in this study
are consistent with published results, with primer
extension results described here, and are consistent
with expectations based on previous work on tran-
scription initiation. We have aligned the sequence
flanking 4637 TSS to identify the consensus sequence
A(Arich)5NPyA(A/T)NN(Arich)6, which confirms and
expands the previous reported PyA(A/T)Pu con-
sensus pattern. The TSS data allowed the identifica-
tion of a previously unrecognized gene, uncovered
errors in previous annotation, and identified potential
regulatory RNAs and upstream open reading frames
in 50-untranslated region.
INTRODUCTION
Comparative genomics is now possible in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae with the genome sequencing of several related
fungal species, including Ashbya gossypii (1), Kluyveromyces
waltii (2), Saccharomyces kluyveri (3), Candida glabrata (4)
and Kluyveromyces lactis (4). While comparative genomics
has been an aid in identifying genes and made it possible to
identify previously overlooked genes (5) and to correct errors
in the yeast genome (6), prediction of promoters and starts
of transcription in either yeast or higher eukaryotes is still
difficult at best (7). For S.cerevisiae, only a limited number
of cDNA sequences have been generated, with 3000
expressed sequence tags and cDNA sequences available
through GenBank. Knowledge of the transcription start site
(TSS) provides insights into the likely location of coding and
non-coding sequence features. Recently, a high-throughput
method of identifying TSS based on a combination of
50 RACE and SAGE analysis has been reported (8–10). We
have independently developed a method similar in strategy
(Figure 1) and demonstrated it in S.cerevisiae. Analysis of
transcript length across the S.cerevisiae genome by microarray
analysis (11) has been carried out, but the resolution of this
approach is insufficient to precisely identify TSS. Examination
of the published literature and of the UTRdb (12) suggests that
for <500 genes have the TSS been published or reported in
GenBank (Table 2). In addition, unlike higher eukaryotes
where the TSS is typically located 25 bp downstream of the
TATA element (13), in S.cerevisiae the TSS ranges from 45 to
120 bases downstream of the TATA element (14) complicat-
ing bioinformatic prediction of the TSS. In eukaryotes, the
sequence around the TSS, sometimes referred to as the Initi-
ator sequence (Inr), has been described to play an important
role in transcription initiation (14,15), particularly in the
absence of a TATA element. The Inr may act as a major
transcription promoter element in TATA-less genes (16,17).
For mammalian genes, the Inr sequence appears to be gene
specific (16) with a minimal consensus ‘CA’ (15,18) where
A is the TSS. In S.cerevisiae, >80% of genes are classified
as TATA-less (19). Further investigation of the nature of
the TSS element depends on identifying TSS locations for a
large number of genes. The small genome size, high-quality
annotation (20) and ease with which high-quality RNA can
be purified (21) from S.cerevisiae make high-throughput
identification of TSS practical.

this study. Yeast was cultured in rich medium (YPD) at 30C.
Escherichia coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) was used in 50
SAGE library construction.
Ditag formation
Total RNA from exponential stage (OD = 1.0) S.cerevisiae is
extracted by the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. Poly(A)+ RNA is
further isolated using NucleoTrap mRNA kit (BD Bioscience
Clontech) and divided into two pools A and B. Each 300 ng
poly(A)+ RNA is converted to double-stranded cDNA using
a SMART cDNA library construction kit (BD Bioscience
Clontech). The manufacturer’s protocol is followed, except that
the primer sequences are altered. First, CDS primer [50-AAGC-
AGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC-(T)30-VN-3
0] (V = A, G
or C) is added with either 50 SAGE template switching (TS)
oligos A (50-GGGATTTGCTGGTGCAGTACAGGATCC-
GACggg-30; lower case, RNA) or B (50-GCTGCTCGAATT-
CAAGCTTCTGGATCCGACggg-30; lower case, RNA) in the
reaction mixture for first strand synthesis and TS at 42C for
90 min. Each oligo final concentration is 1 mM. The newly
synthesized single strand cDNA is used as template for three
cycles primer extension by PCR. The anchoring primers:
Anchor-A, 50-GTGCTCGTGGGATTTGCTGGTGCAGTA-
CAGG-30 and Anchor-B, 50-GAGCTCGTGCTGCTCGAAT-
TCAAGCTTCTGG-30 and the 50 CDS primer are used.
Figure 1. Scheme of 50 SAGE methodology. The poly(A)-rich RNA is divided into two pools. Different oligos set (blue or red) are used to carry out reverse
transcription, template-switching and primer extension. After tagging enzyme (yellow oval) digestion, the two sample pools are combined together to make 120 bp
ditags. The anchoring enzyme (blue triangle) is used to generate 50 bp ditag for concatenation. Specifics are discussed in Materials and Methods.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 9 2839
The primer extension products are checked by electrophoresis
on 2% agarose gel (Supplementary Figure S1A).
The two primer extension products are digested by tagging
enzyme MmeI (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 37C. The
digestion mixture is extracted by phenol–chloroform once and
precipitated by ammonium acetate and ethanol at 80C,
resuspended in TE (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0),
and loaded on a 15% TBE polyacrylamide gel (BioRad)
(Supplementary Figure S1B). After staining with ethidium
bromide, the 60 bp tag band from two pools are combined
and eluted from the gel. The eluted DNA is precipitated
by ethanol and resuspended in 6 ml LoTE (2.5 mM Tris–
HCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).
The gel recovered tag pools in LoTE are ligated by T4 DNA
ligase to form 120 bp ditag in 6 ml reaction at 16C over-
night. The ligation mixture is used to make 1:10, 1:20, 1:40,
1:80 and 1:160 dilutions for PCR optimization. Each 50 ml
reaction contains: 10· reaction buffer 5 ml, dNTP (2.5 mM
each) 5 ml, Anchor-A (10 mM) 5 ml, Anchor-B (10 mM) 5 ml,
diluted ditag template 1 ml and ExTaq (Takara) 1 ml (5 U/ml).
The PCR condition is 95C for 2 min; 95C for 30 s, 55C for
1 min, 72C for 30 s for 27 cycles; and 72C for 5 min. The
reaction mixture is loaded on a 15% TBE polyacrylamide
ready gel (BioRad) to determine the dilution that was suitable
according to the product size and quality (Supplementary
Figure S1C). After optimization, the best PCR condition is
applied in a scaled-up PCR. A total of 200 PCRs are pooled
together and precipitated by ethanol and loaded on 12% TBE
polyacrylamide gel for30 reactions per lane (Supplementary
Figure S1D). Similar protocols as stated previously are used to
recover the 120 bp ditag from the TBE gel into 120 ml LoTE.
Ditag digestion and concatenation
The 120 bp ditag recovered from TBE gel is digested by BamHI
at 37C for 2 h. The 120 bp ditag is digested into 32, 50 and 32 bp
fragments (Supplementary Figure S1E). The gel recovered
50 bp ditag sample is self-ligated at 16C for 5–8 h. The ligation
mixture is loaded on 2% agarose gel with DNA ladder (Sup-
plementary Figure S1F). Different size ranges, 300–500 bp,
500–800 bp and 800–1000 bp are excised and recovered by
gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Different concatemer size ranges
are cloned into the BamHI site of pUC18. Colonies are screened
by blue–white selection on ampicillin Luria–Bertani plates. The
library quality assessment is similar to the standard SAGE
library method provided by the Invitrogen Long SAGE kit.
Sequence analysis and tag extraction
The 50 SAGE library is sequenced using M13 forward/reverse
primers. All sequencing reads were processed by Phred
(22,23) to generate quality scores for each base. Perl scripts
are used to mask out low-quality sequence and get valid ditag
sequence from each sequence read. All ditag sequences are
further processed to get non-redundant tag pools, recording
occurrence and ditag origin of each tag. Considering a possible
amplification effect, we regard tags having the same ditag
origin as occurring only once.
Genome-wide localization analysis
Each valid 50 SAGE tag with occurrence information is
searched against the S.cerevisiae genomic sequence to find
the matching position. All tags are divided into three categor-
ies: tags with unique hit (unitag), tags with multiple hits and
tags with no hit. An open reading frame (ORF) is assigned to
the unitag if the matching position locates within the region
from 500 bp upstream of ATG to 100 bp downstream of stop
codon. The analysis results are organized using a MySQL
database system.
Primer extension
The AMV Primer Extension Kit (Promega) was used. Follow-
ing the manufacturer’s protocol, 10 mg total RNA purified
by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) from S.cerevisiae was reverse
transcribed by annealing with gene-specific 32P-end-labeled
primer (Supplementary Table S1) at 42C for 30 min. The
extension product was separated by electrophoresis on 8%
denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. Bands
were detected on auto-radiographic film.
Statistical analysis
The whole genome gene expression microarray data were
obtained from http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/expression/ (24).
Linear regression model was calculated by R (http://www.
r-project.org/). All distribution results were drawn by JMP
statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc.).
TSS sequence LOGO
The 20 bases of sequence flanking each TSS identified by
unitag was extracted from genomic sequence and processed
by WebLOGO (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/). Since the tag is
always beginning with three or more Gs from the pre-
synthesized adapter, the tag extraction process eliminated
all Gs at the 50 end. Considering a possible loss of G in the
tag 50 end during tag sequence extraction, we added a G at
50 end of tag if tag length is <17 bp and a G is actually there
based on the genomic sequence.
RESULTS
Data summary and mapping to the S.cerevisiae genome
A 50 SAGE library was constructed from S.cerevisiae strain
W303–1A following the flowchart shown in Figure 1. From
2112 sequencing reads, 11 776 non-duplicated ditags were
extracted. From these ditags, we obtained 21 952 tags iden-
tifying 13 746 distinct sequences. Among these 13 746 distinct
tags were 10 866 tags with one or more exact matches in the
S.cerevisiae genome, of which 9738 had only a single genomic
match (unitags). These unitags are evenly distributed through-
out the genome, with the number of tags from each chromo-
some correlating to the gene number (R2 = 0.970) and
chromosome length (R2 = 0.966) (Supplementary Figure
S2). Inspection of the 2880 tags without a match in the genome
revealed that most result from improper trimming of the tags,
likely as a result of MmeI cutting at positions other than the
typical 18/20 bases downstream of the recognition site, or as a
result of improper ligation of the MmeI generated two base
30 overhangs. Most additional unmatched tags resulted from
sequence errors, while strain sequence discrepancies, errors in
the S288C sequence and possible post-transcription RNA edit-
ing (25) potentially account for the remaining non-matching

tags. In some cases, these tag sequences could be edited and
used in the analysis, but to exclude user bias they were not
included in the results reported here.
For each unitag and corresponding mapping position on the
chromosome, the associated gene with the same orientation
was identified using the annotation from SGD (20). Of the
9738 unitags, we identified 8194 unitags locating in the region
from 500 bp upstream of the ATG start codon to 100 bp
downstream of the stop codon of annotated ORFs. As shown
in Table 1, of the 8194 gene-associated unitags, >60% map to
the putative 50-untranslated region (50-UTR), with 89% of
multiple occurrence gene-associated unitags mapping to the
50-UTR. We also noticed that 40% of unitags were mapped
to the coding region and the putative 30-UTR. These tags likely
result from either premature reverse transcriptase termination
or degraded mRNA template. Only 3.7% of unitags in the
coding region and 4.3% in the 30-UTR region occurred more
than once, much lower than the 21.1% of unitags with occur-
rences in the putative 50-UTR, suggesting that most of the
coding region and 30-UTR tags are spurious.

by occurrence from 500 to +1000 relative to the start codon.
Both the histogram and the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) plot indicate that >90% of multiple occurrence unitags
and 70% of unitags are within the 500 bp putative 50-UTR
region. Furthermore, most transcripts start within the region
15–75 bp upstream of the start codon. From the data listed
in Table 1 and Figure 2, we estimate that, among 11 824 occur-
rences of unitags, 54–70% appear to represent actual TSS,
with the remainder spurious.
Of the 4936 unitags from the 50-UTR region, 2231
S.cerevisiae genes were identified. This is 40% of the
protein-coding genes of S.cerevisiae. Among these 2231 genes,
660 genes were identified by at least one multiple occurrence
unitag.
Correlation between tag occurrence, ORF length and
gene expression level
In conventional SAGE analysis, the tag occurrence is approx-
imately proportional to the steady state level of transcripts in
the cell. In 50 SAGE, tag abundance appears to correlate not
only to the level of gene expression but also to gene length
(Figure 3). For this 50 SAGE dataset, tag occurrence decreases
with increasing ORF length, while tag occurrence increases
with mRNA copy number.
50 SAGE tag coverage of highly expressed genes
As indicated above, the number of 50 SAGE tags identified
increased linearly with gene expression. To determine whether
50 SAGE was selectively missing any protein-coding genes,
we examined the 100 most highly expressed genes in the
S.cerevisiae transcriptome (24) and found that 98 were iden-
tified by 50 SAGE and that 88 were identified by multiple
occurrences unitags in the 50-UTR region. We also surveyed
all 288 genes reported as having >10 mRNA copies per cell.
Among these 288 genes, 269 genes have at least one 50 SAGE
tag in the 50-UTR, and 211 have multiple occurrence tags (data
not shown). These results suggest that 50 SAGE does not show
significant bias other than the bias against long transcripts and
weakly expressed genes.
Validation of 50 SAGE with TSS results from the
published literature
As there is no database or reference work summarizing TSS in
S.cerevisiae, we searched the primary literature for those
genes where we have 50 SAGE data. Forty-eight S.cerevisiae
genes for which the TSS has been mapped and published are
listed in Table 2. Because this data is generally found only in
the text of the papers and not in the abstract, it is likely that
some published results were overlooked. Most of these 48
gene TSS were mapped by primer extension (26) or S1 nucle-
ase protection (27), the most commonly used conventional
TSS mapping methods. Comparing the published TSS
information for these genes with our data, we conclude that
the 50 SAGE determined TSS reported here are mostly con-
sistent with the published results, either matching exactly or
being within 1–5 bp (Table 2).
A total of 1128 tags identify multiple locations in the yeast
genome. While it is impossible to identify the precise origin of
these tags, three distinct multiple occurrence tags, with
sequences ‘50-ATAGAAGTCATCGAAA-30’ (6 occurrences)
and ‘50-ATCGAAATAGATATTA(A)-30’ (24 occurrences),
mapped to the 68 and 59 of the multi-copy CUP1 locus,
respectively, and are generally consistent with the previously
published CUP1 TSS at positions65 and56 (28). Multiple
location tags for the abundantly transcribed S.cerevisiae
retrotransposons (29) were also found. Twenty-five distinct

The number of 50 SAGE unitags and corresponding number of total occurrence (Occurence) were categorized into three groups based on mapping positions and two
groups based on the tag occurrence threshold. For each number, the percentage of the total unitag or occurrence (both in bold) is shown in the parenthesis.
aThe (500, 1) is the position relative to the ATG start codon. The (+1, +100) refers to position relative to the STOP codon.
bThe numbers of multiple occurrence unitags. In the 50-UTR category,1041/4936 = 21.1% of unitags are multiple occurrence, while only 107/2861 = 3.7% and
17/397 = 4.3% of unitags mapping to coding region and 30-UTR, respectively, are multiple occurrence.
cThe 4936 putative 50-UTR mapped unitags come from 2231 genes, with a total of 660 genes represent at least one multiple occurrence unitag and 1571 genes
represented by one or more single occurrence unitags.
dTotal tag occurrence of all 50-UTR mapped unitags. We estimate the percentage of tags representing actual TSS as bounded by 8365/11 824 = 70.7% and
(4461 + 1904)/11 824 = 53.8%, where 1904 is an estimate of the number of real single occurrence tag in the putative 50-UTR.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 9 2841
multiple occurrence tags were mapped to the upstream region
of known TyA (Gag) and TyB (Gag-Pol) ORF of Ty1-4 as well
as solo LTR elements. Three of these tags, ‘50-AGGAGAAC-
TTCTAG(TA)-30’, with 19 total occurrences, were mapped
to the TSS of Ty1, consistent with the previously TSS of
50 bp upstream of TyA/B protein start codon (30). Many
of the remaining multiple location tags represent high occur-
rence sequences, such as ‘TAC(T)13’ and sequences from
ribosomal RNA.
In order to further validate our 50 SAGE results, we carried
out TSS mapping by primer extension for 12 S.cerevisiae
genes (Figure 4). Each of these 12 genes gave multiple
TSS by 50 SAGE, most of them having more than one multiple
occurrence tag. Among these 12 genes, the TSS of TPI1,
TEF2, TDH3 and GCN4 were previously published. The
TSS data are included in the list of previously published
TSS for S.cerevisiae for which we obtained TSS results in
this study (Table 2). Our 50 SAGE results and the primer
extension results in Figure 4 generally agree with the previ-
ously published TSS results shown in Table 2, though there are
some discrepancies. For example, the TSS of TEF2 reported
by Nagashima et al. (31) is mapped to 23, yet our 50 SAGE
and primer extension results support an actual TSS of 22.
For TPI1, the TSS has been mapped to 20 by Alber et al.

(32,33), yet appears based on 50 SAGE and primer extension to
actually be at 30.
The primer extension results shown in Figure 4 generally
validate the 50 SAGE results, with 35 out of 42 primer exten-
sion bands corresponding to 50 SAGE predicted TSS, and with
7 out of 42 bands not represented in the 50 SAGE data, and 4 out
of 27 sites predicted by multiple occurrence 50 SAGE tags not
detected by these primer extension results. For these genes,
all high abundance tags (>10 occurrences) corresponded to
readily detected bands.
In addition to protein-coding genes, some non-coding
RNAs, such as snoRNA (34) and the repression RNA SRG1
that regulates the expression of SER3 (35), are transcribed by
RNA polymerase II. Similar to mRNA, these non-coding
RNAs have 30 poly(A) tails and 50 caps (36), and thus can
be detected by 50 SAGE. We successfully mapped TSS unitags
to nine non-coding RNAs (Supplementary Table S2), includ-
ing SRG1. In this study, we identified tags representing both
TSS of SER3 and SRG1, consistent with the published results.
Observations base on the TSS data set
The TSS information obtained from this study provides an
opportunity to examine several aspects of the S.cerevisiae
transcriptome as described below.
Distance between the TSS and TATA elements. Instead of
transcription initiating 25–30 bp downstream of the TATA
element as in higher eukaryotes (13), in S.cerevisiae the
TSS have been previously reported to be 45–120 bp down-
stream of a TATA element (14). The 50 SAGE determined TSS
confirms this observation, with the TATA to TSS distance
ranging from 50 to 125 nt for 80% of the 224 genes for
which there is both 50 SAGE TSS data and for which the
TATA box was previously reported (19) (Supplementary
Figure S3).
Identification of a TSS consensus sequence. In S.cerevisiae
sequence specificity in TSS selection has been reported
(37), with the consensus reported as PyA(A/T)Pu (14,37),
where A is the TSS. From the TSS information collected in
this study, we selected 4937 unitags unambiguously mapping
in the 500 to 0 bp region upstream of each ORF. The
sequence of –10 bp flanking each TSS was extracted from
the S.cerevisiae genomic sequence and analyzed using Web-
LOGO (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/) (Figure 5) (38,39). The
consensus pattern found is A(Arich)5NPyA(A/T)NN(Arich)6,
where A indicates the first transcribed nucleotide. This con-
sensus pattern is unchanged when the analysis is carried out on
the full set of genes, the set of TATA-containing genes, or the
set of TATA-less genes, as classified by Basehoar et al. (19).
This consensus is partially consistent with the previously
reported consensus, the primary change being that an A is
preferable at the –8 position. In addition, relatively A-rich
regions were observed at +5 to +10 and 6 to 2 regions
relative to the TSS. No significant pattern was identified
around the putative TSS from the tags identified within or
downstream of the coding region, further supporting the notion
that these tags are spurious. The frequency of the consensus
pattern in the 50-UTR, coding, and 30-UTRs of all S.cerevisiae
protein-coding genes for 100 bp windows is shown in
Supplementary Figure S4. The consensus pattern is overrep-
resented in the100 to ATG region with 2.54 occurrences/kb,
compared with 0.78 on the minus strand for this same region,
which ranks highest among the regions surveyed.
New gene prediction. Conventional SAGE has identified
previously unidentified genes in S.cerevisiae (40). Similarly,
50 SAGE is uncovering yet more previously unidentified
S.cerevisiae genes. Among 9738 unitags, 684 do not correlate
with any known genes by criteria used in this study. Some of
these ‘orphan’ unitags probably result from spurious tran-
scripts, but some may correspond to transcripts of unknown
protein or RNA coding genes. To identify potential previously
unrecognized protein-coding genes, we looked for ORFs ran-
ging in size from 30 to 100 codons in the sequences down-
stream of each of these 684 orphan unitags. A total of 1184
putative ORFs in this size range were identified. Comparative
methods were used to identify evolutionarily conserved ORFs
Figure 3. Correlation between tag occurrence and ORF length/gene expression level. Each 50-UTR unitag occurrence was plotted with corresponding gene (A) ORF
length, and (B) expression level (mRNA copies/cell). The expression level data is acquired from website http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/expression/ based on
microarray data (24) and the ORF length was calculated based on SGD annotation (20). A linear regression model was applied (R2 = 0.3726, P < 2.2 · 1016).
Negative (0.6320, P = 1.67 · 106) and positive (0.3804, P < 2 · 1016) correlation coefficients were observed from the model for ORF length (bp) and
expression level (mRNA copies/cell), respectively.

from these candidates. For example, the unitag 50-AACGGC-
TAAAACAATT-30 was mapped to the intergenic region
between gene YCL049C and YCL048W of chromosome III.
A putative ORF of 79 codons locates 53 bp downstream of
50 end of the tag, coordinating position 41 488–41 727 on
chromosome III. This new ORF has also been predicted
by Cliften et al. (3) through multiple species comparison.
Comparison of this gene with other hemiascomycete fungi
genomic sequences indicates that this ORF is found only
among the Saccharomyces sensu stricto. We also found this
new ORF has an annotated paralog, YDR524C-B, on chromo-
some IV, synteny between these two regions being identified
by comparison with the gene order in A.gossypii (Figure 6A).
This supports this new gene prediction and suggests that this
pair of genes arose as a result of the whole genome duplication
in the S.cerevisiae lineage (1,41).
Correction of gene annotation. One of the major caveats of
genomic sequence based gene annotation is that it is difficult to
determine the ATG start codon when there are multiple
in-frame ATGs close to the 50 end. By default, in S.cerevisiae
ORFs were annotated starting from the most 50 ATG. In some
cases, this is not the actual start codon (3,42). Using TSS
data obtained in this study combined with multi-species
comparative analysis, we found 14 cases where it is likely
that the incorrect ATG start codon is currently annotated.
For each of these 14 genes (Table 3), no UTR TSS tags are
present, while multiple occurrences TSS tags are found within
the coding region as currently annotated. Alignment of the
protein sequence with other recently sequenced fungal species
(3,42) shows low sequence conservation in the putative 50
domain and inconsistent occurrence of start codons analogous
to the currently annotated S.cerevisiae start codon. These two
lines of evidence suggest that a currently internal ATG codon
is a more likely start codon. An example, LSM6/YDR378C,
is shown in Figure 6B. However, it is also possible that some
of these genes may be similar to HTS1 (43) where multiple
transcription starts give rise to proteins with alternative
N-terminal ends.
Finding a putative non-coding RNA gene. Following the
SRG1–SER3 paradigm, we have identified an additional
case of a gene with widely separated multiple occurrence
tags in the 50-UTR. This gene, ODC2/YOR222W, with mul-
tiple occurrence tags located at positions 459 and 28 is
shown in Figure 6C. Alignment of orthologous sequence from
related fungal species shows sequences around both TSS are
conserved. A conventional SAGE tag 50-CATGAAA-
TAGTGGT-30 uniquely mapping to the position 286 (44)
further suggests that a small RNA coding transcript is tran-
scribed from the 50-UTR region of ODC2. Examination of this
region shows no evidence of a conserved protein sequence,
suggesting that this transcript is not protein coding.

uORF detection. Some S.cerevisiae genes, such as GCN4 and
CPA1, have regulatory uORFs in their 50 region (45). A major
obstacle in identifying uORF-containing genes is the lack of
TSS information for most S.cerevisiae genes. Examination
of the 660 genes having multiple occurrence tags in their
putative 50-UTR region identifies a total of 24 genes that
appear to contain at least one uORF in their 50-UTR leader
sequence (Supplementary Table S3). Comparison of these
50-UTR regions with the corresponding regions of orthologous
genes of several related hemiascomycete species (1,3,42,46)
revealed that in several cases the uORFs are conserved,
with PCL5 having the most conserved uORF pattern. Based
on the 50 SAGE tags, the length of PCL5 mRNA 50-UTR
ranges from 301 to 362 bp with this region containing two
uORFs. The uORF1, located at position 171, appears to be
present in Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae
and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, and also in several more
distantly related species (Figure 6D).
Figure 6. New features predicted in S.cerevisiae insights from the TSS information from 50 SAGE data combined with comparative genomics methods have versatile
usages include: (A) New gene discovery: synteny view of S.cerevisiae chromosomal IV and III regions, which are believed to be duplicated regions resulting from the
whole genome duplication. Each orthologous gene pair is shown in the same color. Two 50 SAGE unitags with total three occurrences (yellow arrow) revealed a new
gene, YCL048W-A, which is homologous to YDR524C-B. (B) Determine the real ATG start codon: Two unitags with one having multiple occurrences are mapped to
the coding region of LSM6, while no tag is associated to its 50-UTR. Protein sequence alignment to orthologs from other Saccharomyces species further supports the
proposed LSM6 translation start position. (C) Search of putative regulatory RNA element similar to SRG1–SER3. Two multiple occurrence tags upstream of ODC2
coding region are shown (yellow arrow). The phylogenic comparison showed homology around these two TSS position among multiple species. There is also a
conventional SAGE tag (green arrow) that maps to this region with position 286. (D) Example of uORF containing gene. Four unitags with one having multiple
occurrences were mapped to 300+ bp upstream of PCL5 coding region. Two small uORFs (blue and red) are found and conserved among all four sensu stricto species
in terms of position, length and sequences. Five other hemiascomycete species also contain similar putative uORF(s) in that region. In C.glabrata, three uORFs are
present, with two overlapping in different reading frames.

DISCUSSION
We have shown that 50 SAGE is able to generate accurate
TSS data for S.cerevisiae. This method combines the use of
TypeIIS restriction enzymes and the ditag strategy from SAGE
with the template switching TSS identification of SMART

RACE (47,48), to determine the TSS. We have used a TS
approach to capture the TSS instead of the cap-capture
approach, which has been used successfully with human and
mouse mRNA (8–10), showing that there are at least two
workable approaches to 50 SAGE. The accuracy of this method
derives from the ditag strategy in 50 SAGE that, as in SAGE, is
essential to insure that each tag originates from a different
mRNA and is not an artifact of PCR amplification. This con-
fidence that multiple occurrence tags are independent is essen-
tial as we depend on multiplicity of occurrences to validate the
individual unitag sites.
Carrying out 50 SAGE on S.cerevisiae we have found that
the TSS identified by 50 SAGE agrees well with previously
reported data, with significant disagreement for only 7 out of
48 genes. The seven genes (PIM1, HEM1, URA1, URA4,
HSC82, ADH2 and TPI1) for which there is significant disag-
reement as to the location of the TSS need to be more closely
investigated to identify the source of the discrepancy. For
TPI1, primer extension results support the 30 position of
the main TSS detected by 50 SAGE, suggesting that the pre-
vious report (32) is erroneous. In some cases, the 50 SAGE
TSS data differed from published primer extension data by
1–5 bases. This 1–5 base discrepancy may result from the
difficulties associated with obtaining single base pair resolu-
tion with either primer extension or nuclease protection
assays. An example of this is TEF2, where our 50 SAGE
and primer extension results identify the 50-UTR as being
1 nt shorter than the previously published (31). In some
cases, including TDH3, GLN1, IMD2, RPS17A, GCN4,
TEF2, ARO4 and HEM3, a small number of tags are upstream
of the majority of the 50 SAGE tags and the previously pub-
lished TSS. It is unclear whether these tags are artifacts, rep-
resent rare transcripts from an upstream TSS, or represent
regulatory RNAs similar to SRG1. For TEF2, TDH3 and
GCN4, we have verified by primer extension the occurrence
of these upstream TSS.
Our estimation of the accuracy of this method is also sup-
ported by the consistency of the TSS identified by 50 SAGE
with the previously reported TSS consensus sequence. Based
on the frequency of tags falling outside of the 50-UTR and the
frequency of potentially spurious single occurrence tags within
the 50-UTR, we estimate that 54–70% of all 50 SAGE TSS tags
represent actual TSS. While 30–46% of 50 SAGE tags do not
represent true start sites and likely result from premature ter-
mination of reverse transcription or degraded mRNA, these
false tags cause little problem as our basis for identifying TSS
relies on multiple tag occurrence. Determination of the TSS
for a specific gene by 50 SAGE thus requires sequencing of the
50 SAGE library to sufficient depth so that multiple TSS are
represented for each gene. Approximately 10% of the tags had
multiple positions in the genome, consistent with the fraction
of repetitive sequences in this genome, and their transcription
level.
The refined consensus sequence we have identified for
S.cerevisiae differs significantly from that of human. The
larger TSS consensus sequence in S.cerevisiae combined
with the variable distance of TSS from the TATA element
(49) has been previously suggested to indicate that the mech-
anism of transcription start in S.cerevisiae is significantly dif-
ferent than in human (50). It has been suggested that instead
of assembly of the RNA polymerase II complex at the TATA
element coupled to transcription initiation at an adjacent
site (51), RNA polymerase II in S.cerevisiae may utilize a
scanning model to identify the TSS (49). Supporting the
idea that RNA polymerase may scan from the TATA to the
TSS in S.cerevisiae is the observation from Giardina and
Lis (52) that for the GAL1 and GAL10 promoters, the region
of transcription-associated promoter melting is located adja-
cent to the TATA element as has been shown for mammalian
TATA elements. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the TSS has
been reported to be 25–40 bp from the TATA element (53),
suggesting that having the transcription start adjacent to the
site of polymerase assembly may be the more typical euka-
ryotic mode of transcription initiation, and that S.cerevisiae

has an unusual mode of transcription initiation. The TSS
consensus sequence found in this study is highly A-rich. As
the S.cerevisiae genome is overall >60% AT, and the region of
the TSS is >37% A, interpretation of the role of the A-rich
regions in this consensus sequence is unclear, whether the
poly(A) stretches surrounding the TSS are important in tran-
scription initiation, or whether they are an artifact of some other
aspect of genome structure. While some mutagenesis work on
the TSS has been carried out in S.cerevisiae (54,55), further
mutagenesis work in S.cerevisiae and TSS identification in one
of the closely related but GC-rich hemiascomycetes, such as
A.gossypii (1) will be necessary to refine our understanding of
this consensus sequence. The identity of the TSS consensus
sequence from TATA-containing genes and TATA-less genes
suggests that the mechanism by which the TSS is selected in
S.cerevisiae is independent of the presence of a TATA element.
This is in contrast to transcription initiation in human, where,
based on a small number of genes, it has been shown that for
genes lacking a TATA element a 19 bp window including the
TSS, the Inr element, is necessary and sufficient for transcrip-
tion initiation (16).
We have identified multiple tag TSS for 660 protein-coding
genes in this study, representing 11% of the 5800 protein-
coding genes in S.cerevisiae (56). Consistent with the
previously published results, 50 SAGE data indicate that the
majority of S.cerevisiae genes have multiple TSS. We have
refined the TSS consensus sequence, refined the TSS to ATG
and TSS to TATA average distance measurements, identified
the location of a potential regulatory RNA upstream of ODC2
and identified 24 genes with potential uORFs in their 50-UTR.
We have also identified a previously overlooked protein-
coding gene and have provided evidence, suggesting the start-
ing methionine for 14 S.cerevisiae genes differs from that
currently annotated. Thus, 50 SAGE, in identifying the TSS
of both protein-coding genes and RNA polymerase II tran-
scribed RNA coding genes, provides data useful to under-
standing gene regulation as well as providing data refining
the annotation of S.cerevisiae.
A variation on 50 SAGE we are currently using involves
replacing the oligo(dT) primer used in the reverse transcription
step with a pool of 480 oligonucleotides selected from the minus
strand at approximately +100 relative to the starting coding.
These primers are selected to be unique in the genome, have
similar melting temperatures and GC content. Initial experi-
ments have revealed that it is also necessary to select the pool of
primers to minimize primer–primer complementarity as the
MMLV reverse transcriptase is able to extend complementary
primers to create false tags. Using pools of primers, a method we
refer to as 50 SAGE II, we are currently generating and evalu-
ating libraries. Preliminary results include the identification of
the TSS of PFY1, the gene coding profiling, at 41, consistent
with the previously published value of41 as major TSS (57).
Further refinements of these methods will allow the identifica-
tion of the TSS of the set of transcribed S.cerevisiae genes, not
just the most highly expressed genes.
