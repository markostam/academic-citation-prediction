ABSTRACT
DNA-PK is a protein complex that consists of a DNA-
binding, regulatorysubunit [Ku]anda larger465kDa
catalytic subunit [DNA-PKcs], a serine/threonine
protein kinase. The kinase activity of DNA-PKcs
resides between residues 3745 and 4013, a PI3 kinase
domain. Another recognized domain within this
large protein is a leucine zipper (LZ) motif or perhaps
more appropriately designated a leucine rich region
(LRR) that spans residues 1503–1602. Whereas, DNA-
PK’s kinase activity has been shown to be absolutely
indispensable for its function in non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ), little is known about the functional
relevance of the LRR. Here we show that DNA-PKcs
with point mutations in the LRR can only partially
reverse the radiosensitive phenotype and V(D)J
recombination deficits of DNA-PKcs deficient
cells. Disruption of the LRR motif affects the ability
to purify DNA-PKcs via its binding to DNA-cellulose,
but does not affect its interaction with Ku or its
catalytic activity. These data suggest that the LRR
region of DNA-PKcs may contribute to its
intrinsic DNA affinity, and moreover, that intrinsic
DNA binding is important for optimal function of
DNA-PKcs in repairing double strand breaks in living
cells.
INTRODUCTION
The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays an
essential role in non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ)
by initially localizing to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).
Its immense size (465 kDa) suggests that the catalytic
subunit of DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs) may function (at least
in part) as a scaffold to organize a DNA repair complex
[reviewed in (1,2)]. Indeed, DNA-PKcs has been shown
to interact with several other polypeptides including the Ku
heterodimer, the XRCC4–DNA ligase IV complex, the Arte-
mis endonuclease and the nuclear matrix protein C1D. An
emerging consensus of DNA-PK’s function is that after initial
binding (one DNA-PK complex per DNA end), synapsis of
two complexes activates DNA-PK’s kinase activity (known to
be requisite for NHEJ), and the active complex targets other
repair factors to the site of DNA damage [reviewed in (1,2)].
Although numerous phosphorylation substrates of DNA-PK
have been identified, to date the only DNA-PK phosphoryla-
tion event shown conclusively to be requisite in NHEJ are
those targeting DNA-PKcs itself (3–13). Consistent with a
model whereby DNA-PKcs serves a scaffolding role is data
suggesting that DNA-PKcs regulates access of broken DNA
ends to repair factors via autophosphorylation (4,7,8,14,15).
Thus, autophosphorylation-induced conformational changes
of DNA-PK may orchestrate an as yet undefined sequence
of repair events.
Recent structural studies suggest that DNA-PKcs has
three major domains, and that it shares this organization
with the related kinase, ATM. The three domains have been
termed as palm, arm and head (16,17). The head contains
both the enzymatic (PI3 kinase) motifs as well as regions
previously implicated in DNA-PKcs’s interaction with Ku.
The arm is a connecting domain and likely contains important
regulatory autophosphorylation sites. The palm consists of
two protruding regions termed claws. The distal claw most
probably comprises the extreme N-terminus of DNA-PKcs;
the proximal claw likely contains the leucine rich region
(LRR). In the DNA-bound confirmation, a significant con-
formation change occurs such that the head and palm clamp
together, possibly stabilizing the protein–DNA interaction.
In 1998, Jackson et al. (18) identified C1D as a factor that
interacts specifically both in vitro and in vivo with the LRR of
DNA-PKcs. C1D was originally identified (by expression
cloning) as a 16 kDa polypeptide that is released from rigor-
ously extracted and nuclease-digested DNA. The authors pro-
posed that C1D is a nuclear matrix protein that might be
involved in gene regulation (19). More recent studies have
implicated C1D in promoting apoptosis in mammalian cells
(20) and in contributing to both NHEJ and HR in yeast (21).

Whether C1D functions in either NHEJ or HR in higher
eukaryotes has not been addressed.
Here, using a mutagenic approach, we address the func-
tional relevance of DNA-PK’s LRR. We demonstrate that
DNA-PKcs deficient cells expressing the LRR mutant
(LRRm1) protein are considerably more radiosensitive and
less proficient at V(D)J recombination than cells that express
wild-type DNA-PKcs. Additionally, DNA-PKcs harboring a
mutation within the LRR (LRRm1) fractionates poorly with
DNA cellulose as compared to the wild-type protein. How-
ever, pull-down experiments demonstrate that the LRR mutant
interacts with the DNA-binding protein, C1D analogous to
wild-type DNA-PKcs. Similarly, in vitro LRRm1 interacts
with Ku as well as wild-type DNA-PKcs. The poor fractiona-
tion onto DNA cellulose is therefore attributed to disruption of
the innate DNA-binding capabilities of DNA-PKcs. Thus, we
conclude that in addition to being recruited to DNA breaks by
its DNA end-binding partner Ku, the intrinsic interaction of
DNA-PKcs with DNA is also functionally important.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
The V3, DNA-PKcs deficient double strand break repair
[DSBR] mutant CHO cell line (22) was the gift of Dr Martin
Gellert. Cells were maintained in aMEM with 10% fetal calf
serum (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). Stable transfectants
were maintained with 400 mg/ml G418. Sf9 cells were main-
tained in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
containing 1% antibiotic–antimycotic. The cells were grown at
27C without CO2.

Oligonucleotides used in this study are as follows (50 > 30):
KAM 110, GGAACAAGAGAATGGAGATGA; KAM 111,
GCTTCTGTGCATGTGCTTGAC, (KAM 110, 111 flank the
LRR); KAM 112 and its complement 113, GACTTCTG-

into pGEX 5X-3); KAM 482 and its complement 483,
CTCAGTTGAAGCAGCCGGCCAGCGGACTTCTG (used
to generate LRRm2).
Construction and transfection of expression plasmids
Construction of the wild-type human DNA-PKcs expression
vector was described previously (23). To generate the expres-
sion plasmids encoding the LRR mutant, duplex oligonuc-
leotides KAM 112 and KAM 113 flanking the LRR were
used to amplify a 5 kb fragment using human DNA-PKcs
cDNA as the template DNA. The subsequent PCR fragment
was cloned using the Topo-TA cloning kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The res-
ulting plasmid was utilized to generate the LRR mutant by
Quik change mutagenesis according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This PCR fragment
spans two EheI sites at positions 1770 and 6280 in the
open reading frame of the human DNA-PKcs cDNA. This
fragment was subsequently subcloned into the wild-type
DNA-PKcs expression vector after sequencing analyses con-
firmed that no additional substitutions were introduced during
PCR amplifications.
V3 transfectants expressing human DNA-PKcs were
derived as described previously (4).
DNA cellulose pulldown of DNA-PK, measurement of
protein kinase activity and nuclear matrix preparations
Whole cell extracts were prepared and kinase activity was
measured as described previously (4). To assess fractionation
of DNA-PKcs onto DNA-cellulose, whole cell extracts were
absorbed onto DNA-cellulose in 500 ml buffer A [25 mM
HEPES, pH 7.9; 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v)
glycerol; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; 1 mM DTT and the
indicated concentration of NaCl] for 1 h at 4C. Beads were
washed three times in the same buffer and washed beads were
suspended in 2· SDS–PAGE buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8,
10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue and
25 ml 2-mercaptoethanol added fresh to 475 ml of the buffer).
The beads were then heated for 5 min at 70C, centrifuged at
1.5 r.p.m. for 2 min. The supernatant was then analyzed by
immunoblotting as described previously (4).
To visualize mobilization of DNA-PKcs in response to
DSBs, V3 transfectants were treated for 1 h with bleomycin
(Sigma, St Louis, MO). Membrane-insoluble fractions were
prepared as described previously (24).
V(D)J recombination assays, assessment of
radiosensitivity and drug sensitivity
Extrachromosomal recombination assays were performed as
described previously (4). To assess radiosensitivity, cells
(3 · 103) were exposed to various amounts of ionizing radi-
ation using a 60Co source and immediately seeded in complete
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 7 days, cell
colonies were fixed with ethanol, stained with crystal violet
and colony numbers were assessed. To assess bleomycin
sensitivity, cells (5000) were seeded in complete medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 24-well culture plates
and exposed to various amounts of bleomycin sulfate. After
5 days, cell viability was assessed by MTT staining.
Expression of fusion proteins and
pull-down experiments
A cDNA encoding full-length human C1D was amplified from
human brain mRNA by RT–PCR using oligonucleotides KAM
281 and KAM 282. The termination codon was not included,
and the amplified fragment was cloned into pcDNA-6V5/His
expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that encodes a
C-terminal V5-HIS tag. The above cDNA was then used as a
template to amplify and subclone C1D into BamH1 and
XhoI sites in pFastBac I (a baculovirus expression vector)
using oligonucleotides KAM 390 and KAM 391. The
oligonucleotides encode an N-terminal His tag. Human

Ku70 and Ku80 cDNA cloned into pFastBac Dual was a gift
from Dr Dale Ramsden.
Whole cell extracts from V3 transfectants (2 mg) and whole
cell extracts from either C1D-infected, Ku-infected or control
virus-infected Sf9 cells were co-incubated for 30 min in buffer
A at 4C. Subsequently, 30 ml of Ni+ agarose was added, and
the extracts were absorbed in buffer A with 25 mM imidazole.
After 1 h, the Ni+ agarose was washed three times with buffer
A containing 50 mM imidazole. Proteins were eluted with
SDS–PAGE buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting.
To express LRR fusion proteins in bacteria, the LRR (amino
acids 1471–1592) was amplified using DNA-PKcs plasmids
(either wild-type or LRR mutant) as the template using oli-
gonucleotides KAM 439 and KAM 440. The PCR product was
digested and subcloned into BamH1 and XhoI sites in pGEX-
5X-3 (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) to generate GST-LRR or
GST-LRRm1 expression plasmids. The GST-LRRm1 was
then utilized as a template to generate GST-LRRm2
(L1510P, E1516D, L1517P) by Quik change mutagenesis
(Stratagene, LaJolla, CA) using oligonucleotides KAM 482
and KAM 483. GST-LRRdel was generated by deleting the
Xba1-Nco1 fragment (amino acids 1504–1551) from GST-
LRR. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm that no extra
substitutions had been introduced by PCR amplification.
The expression plasmids for GST-fusion proteins were
transformed into Escherchia coli BL-21 (DE3) (Stratagene,
LaJolla, CA). To express GST-fusion proteins, a 5 ml over-
night culture was used as a seed culture for 100 ml Luria–
Bertani broth. The bacteria were grown at 37C to reach the
A600 of 0.6 and then induced with 1 mM IPTG at 27
C for 4 h.
The cells were harvested and suspended in 5 ml lysis buffer
(50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and Protease inhibitor
cocktail tablet) (Complete Mini; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and
sonicated for 15 min on ice. The lysate was then centrifuged in
an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed for 15 min at 4C.
The induction and solubility was assessed by SDS–PAGE
followed by Coomassie staining.

Whole cell lysate from bacteria expressing either GST alone
or equal amounts of GST-LRR, GST-LRRm1, GST-LRRm2
or GST-LRRdel and whole cell extracts from His tagged C1D-
infected Sf9 cells were co-incubated in buffer A for 30 min at
4C. Subsequently, 30 ml of pre-swollen glutathione–agarose
(pre-equilibrated in buffer A) was added and incubated for 1 h
at 4C. After 1 h, the glutathione–agarose was washed three
times with buffer A containing 2 mM glutathione (reduced
form). Proteins were eluted with SDS–PAGE buffer and ana-
lyzed for C1D by immunoblotting using anti-His (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) as the primary antibody (1:5000 dilution).
RESULTS
LRRm1 only partially reverses
V3’s radiosensitive phenotype
A potential leucine zipper (LZ) motif within the DNA-PKcs
coding sequence spanning residues 1503–1538 was noted by
Hartley et al. (25) in the original sequence analysis of the
molecule. It consists of six leucine residues, each separated
by six residues. More recently, other investigators consider
this region (1503–1539) to be more appropriately designated
as an LRR (33% leucine) since the first and fourth leucine resi-
dues (aa1502 and aa1524, respectively) are substituted in
chicken and Xenopus DNA-PKcs. The other four leucine resi-
dues of the putative LZ are conserved among all vertebrates (26)
(Figure 1A). A more extensive overlapping region within DNA-
PKcs (1503–1602) is also relatively leucine rich (20%). DNA-
PKcs is highly homologous (63–85%) in the six species with
complete DNA-PKcs sequences available, (human, horse, dog,
mouse, chicken and frog). The LRR is similarly well conserved.
In the report from Yavuzer et al. (18) demonstrating that
C1D interacts with the LRR of DNA-PKcs, two site-specific
mutants of a DNA-PKcs polypeptide that ablated its interac-
tion with C1D were studied. One of the mutants contains two
point mutations substituting aspartic acid and proline for the
glutamic acid and leucine residues at amino acids 1516 and
1517 as indicated in Figure 1A. This mutant peptide was not
able to interact with CID as assessed by yeast two-hybrid
assays (18).
To begin to assess the functional relevance of the LRR of
DNA-PKcs in living cells, these mutations were introduced
into the complete DNA-PKcs cDNA. Wild-type and mutant
constructs encoding DNA-PKcs (designated WT and LRRm1)
were stably transfected into DSBR mutant V3 cells that lack
DNA-PKcs and are thus defective in NHEJ. Clones with sim-
ilar levels of DNA-PKcs expression were selected for further
study (Figure 1B). To assess the ability of the wild-type and
mutant constructs to reverse the known radiosensitive pheno-
type of V3 cells, cell irradiation assays were performed. As
can be seen (Figure 1C), although the LRR mutant renders
cells significantly more radioresistant than cells transfected
with vector alone, cells expressing the mutant protein are
still substantially more radiosensitive than cells expressing
equivalent levels of wild-type DNA-PKcs. Thus, we conclude
that the LRR mutant protein can only partially complement the
radiosensitivity of V3 cells.
LRRm1 supports reduced levels of coding and
signal end joining in V3 cells
The ability of the mutant DNA-PKcs to support RAG-induced
V(D)J recombination in V3 cells was tested. As can be seen
(Table 1), wild-type DNA-PKcs substantially complements

Transient V(D)J recombination assays were performed as described in Materials and Methods. RAG expression from plasmid vectors initiates recombination in the V3

the coding end joining deficit of V3 cells (assessed with sub-
strate pJH290). In contrast LRRm1 supports only reduced
levels of coding end joining as compared to wild-type
DNA-PKcs (1.5- to 14-fold reduced). We and others have
reported previously that V3 cells have a significant signal
end joining deficit that is substantially reversed by transfecting
wild-type DNA-PKcs (4,27,28). Consistent with those results,
we find here that wild-type DNA-PKcs substantially increases
the recovery of signal joints from V3 cells (assessed with
substrate pJH201). Although co-transfection of LRRm1 also
increases the recovery of signal joints from V3 cells, the num-
bers are consistently reduced as compared to transfections
with wild-type DNA-PKcs (1.2- to 8-fold). As reported pre-
viously, co-transfection of an ATP binding site mutant (K>M)
does not alter the levels of either coding or signal joints in
transient assays as compared to transfections with no DNA-
PKcs at all (29). These modest affects on coding and signal end
resolution are consistent with the mild radiosensitivity
observed in cells expressing LRRm1. Thus, we conclude
that LRRm1 can only partially support either signal or coding
end joining during V(D)J recombination.
Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that mutations
in DNA-PKcs’s numerous autophosphorylation sites dramat-
ically affect end processing of coding joints (4,8). More
specifically these data demonstrate that two conserved auto-
phosphorylation site clusters reciprocally regulate end pro-
cessing. Thus, blocking phosphorylation in one cluster
(by mutagenesis) clocks end processing, whereas blocking
phosphorylation in the second cluster dramatically enhances
end processing. To determine whether mutations in the LRR
affect end processing, DNA was prepared from recombined
plasmids isolated from transient V(D)J assays. However,
sequence analysis of coding joints mediated by the LRR mut-
ant as compared to those mediated by the wild-type protein
were comparable with regards to nucleotide loss and percent
complete coding ends (Table 2). We conclude that coding joints
mediated by the LRR mutant protein are structurally normal.
Both LRRm1 and wild-type DNA-PKcs
interact with C1D
To confirm that the functional deficits of LRRm1 could be
attributed to disruption of its interaction with C1D, a bacu-
lovirus vector expressing His-tagged C1D was constructed
and expressed in Sf9 cells for pull down experiments
(Figure 2A). Extracts from C1D-infected Sf9 or control
virus-infected Sf9 cells were incubated with the cell extracts
Figure 2. Both LRRm1 and wild-type DNA-PKcs interact equivalently with C1D and are targeted similarly to nuclear matrix by DSBs. (A) Whole cell extract from
Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing His-tagged C1D was incubated with Ni+ agarose beads (lane 3). Beads were washed and analyzed for C1D expression
by SDS–PAGE. (B) Ni+ agarose fractions of whole cell extracts (2 mg) from V3 transfectants expressing either wild-type DNA-PKcs (lanes 1 and 3) or LRRm1 (lanes

DNA-PKcs. (C) Bleomycin resistance of V3 transfectants expressing wild-type DNA-PKcs, vector alone or LRRm1 was assessed as described in Materials and
Methods. Data are presented as percent survival of untreated controls. Error bars depict standard error of the mean of three separate experiments. (D) V3 transfectants
expressing either wild-type DNA-PKcs (lane1–2) or LRRm1 (lanes 3–4) were left untreated or were treated with bleomycin (140 mM). Nuclear matrix fractions were
prepared as described in Materials and Methods and then immunoblotted for DNA-PKcs, gH2AX and LaminB as indicated.

from V3 transfectants expressing either wild-type or LRRm1
DNA-PKcs and Ni+ agarose. To our surprise (and in contrast
with the yeast two hybrid studies of Yavuzer et al.), both wild-
type and mutant proteins fractionate similarly with immobil-
ized C1D onto Ni+ agarose (Figure 2B).
Both LRRm1 and wild-type DNA-PKcs mobilize to
nuclear matrix in response to DSBs
There is a large body of evidence that DNA and RNA modi-
fying enzymes are sequestered to particular nuclear compart-
ments, in some cases by association with the nuclear matrix
[reviewed in Ref. (30)]. Recently, Drouet et al. have shown
that in response to DNA DSBs, DNA-PKcs is mobilized to a
triton non-extractable fraction of the nuclear compartment (the
nuclear matrix, 24). Yavuzer et al. (18) had previously hypo-
thesized that C1D might be involved in targeting DNA-PKcs
to the nuclear matrix in response to DNA damage. High doses
of bleomycin were utilized to induce DSBs in the study of
Drouet et al. As expected, cells expressing LRRm1 display
intermediate sensitivity to bleomycin as compared to cells
expressing wild-type DNA-PKcs or no DNA-PKcs at all
(Figure 2C). We next examined the mobilization of LRRm1
to the nuclear matrix in response to DNA damage induced by
bleomycin. V3 transfectants expressing either LRRm1 or
wild-type DNA-PKcs were treated with bleomycin for 1 h
to induce DSBs, and cells were fractionated as outlined by
Drouet et al. The extracted fraction was then analyzed by
immunoblotting for DNA-PKcs levels.
As shown in Figure 2D, there is a significant mobilization of
DNA-PKcs and g-H2AX to the nuclear matrix fraction in
response to DSBs (laminB is a constitutive nuclear matrix
protein). However, both LRRm1 and wild-type DNA-PKcs
associate with the nuclear matrix equally well. Thus, we con-
clude that the NHEJ defect in the LRR mutant cannot be
attributed to disruption of its interaction with either C1D or
the nuclear matrix.
Both the LRR and regions outside the LRR in DNA-PKcs
contribute to its interaction with C1D
To understand the discrepancy between our results and the
results published by Yavuzer et al., we considered that the
LRR motif is not adequately disrupted in the full-length mut-
ant protein. To address whether disruption of both L1510 and
L1517 might more completely disrupt the LRR, we generated
several GST fusion proteins spanning the LRR. These include
wild-type DNA-PKcs, GST-LRR (spanning residues 1471–
1592), GST-LRRm1 (with the same mutations already tested
in the full length protein, E1516D and L1517P) GST-LRRm2
(including L1510P, E1516D, and L1517P) and GST-LRRdel
(deleting residues 1504–1551) (Figure 3A). GST fusion pro-
teins were co-incubated with extracts from C1D infected Sf9
cells and immobilized onto glutathione agarose beads and
analyzed for C1D by immunoblotting (Figure 3B). GST-
LRRm1 is substantially reduced in its ability to interact
with C1D in agreement with the yeast two-hybrid results pub-
lished by Yavuzer et al. (18) although the mutant retains weak
affinity for C1D. Furthermore, GST-LRRm2 and GST-
LRRdel also interact weakly with C1D. These data suggest
that both the LRR and regions outside the LRR contribute to
DNA-PKcs’s interaction with C1D.
LRRm1 binds poorly to DNA-cellulose but has
normal enzymatic activity
We next tested the mutant for its enzymatic activity utilizing
standard DNA cellulose pull-down assays. Extracts from cells
expressing LRRm1 consistently displayed approximately 2-
fold reduced kinase activity as compared to extracts prepared
from cells expressing similar amounts of wild-type DNA-
PKcs (Figure 4A). However, immunoblotting of the DNA-
cellulose fractions used for the kinase assays revealed that
LRRm1 fractionates poorly onto DNA cellulose as compared
to the wild-type protein (Figure 4B). This result was highly
reproducible as revealed by densitometric quantification of
three independent DNA-cellulose binding assays
(Figure 4C). Furthermore, the reduction in DNA cellulose
fractionation correlated well with the 2-fold reduction in
kinase activity of the mutant suggesting that the reduced
kinase activity observed in extracts from LRRm1 expressing
cells is the result of reduced affinity for DNA and not an
intrinsic enzymatic defect.
To test this more formally, enzymatic activity was assessed
by immobilizing LRRm1 or wild-type DNA-PKcs via Ni+-
agarose immobilized C1D (Figure 4D). As can be seen,
LRRm1 and wild-type DNA-PKcs partially purified by C1D
Figure 3. Both the LRR and regions outside the LRR of DNA-PKcs contribute
to its interaction with C1D. (A) Whole cell lysates from bacteria expressing
GST (lane 2) or GST-LRR (lane 4), sGST-LRRm1 (lane 5), GST-LRRm2 (lane
6) or GST-LRRdel (lane 7) were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads.
Beads were washed and analyzed for protein expression by SDS-PAGE fol-
lowed by Coomassie blue staining. (B) Whole cell lysates from bacteria ex-
pressing GST (lane 1), GST-LRR (lane 2), GST-LRRm1 (lane 3), GST-LRRm2

from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing His-C1D and absorbed onto
glutathione-agarose. Glutathione beads were washed and immunoblotted for
His-C1D.

affinity have similar enzymatic activity as measured by phos-
phorylation of the p53 peptide substrate (Figure 4E). We con-
clude that the LRRm1 mutation does not affect the enzyme’s
protein kinase activity.
The LRR contributes to the intrinsic affinity of
DNA-PKcs for DNA
Previous studies have established that residues in the FAT
domain of DNA-PKcs are involved in its interaction with
Ku (31); thus, it seemed unlikely that mutation in LRRm1
disrupted the mutant’s ability to interact with Ku. Still, since
the mutant protein exhibits a defect in DNA-binding, we
considered the possibility that the LRR facilitates the inter-
action of DNA-PKcs with Ku bound to DNA. To address
this, His-tagged Ku70/80 was expressed in baculovirus
(Figure 5A). Whole cell extracts from either Ku-infected or
control-infected Sf9 cells were incubated with extracts from
transfectants expressing wild-type or LRR mutant DNA-PKcs.
The Ku-DNA-PKcs complex was then absorbed onto Ni+
agarose beads; as can be seen (Figure 5B) both LRRm1
and wild-type DNA-PKcs interact equivalently with Ni+
agarose bound Ku.
Ku binds directly to DNA ends. When Ku recruits DNA-
PKcs, Ku translocates to internal sites in the DNA and DNA-
PKcs interacts directly with the DNA end (32,33). Previous
studies have established that DNA-PKcs can bind DNA ends
in the absence of Ku (34–36), but direct DNA binding by
DNA-PKcs is salt labile. DNA-PKcs only binds DNA ends
in Ku’s absence in low salt concentrations. We considered that
LRRm1 might have a deficit in its intrinsic affinity for DNA.
Thus, we tested the ability of LRR mutant to bind DNA in
various salt conditions by incubating whole cell extracts from
stable transfectants with DNA cellulose (Figure 5C). As can be
seen, the LRR mutant protein fractionates poorly onto DNA
Figure 4. LRRm1 binds poorly to DNA-cellulose but has normal enzymatic activity. (A) Whole-cell extracts (250 mg) from V3 cells transfected with either vector
alone, wild-type DNA-PKcs or LRRm1 were assayed for DNA-PK activity as described in Materials and Methods. Each cell extract was tested in duplicate and three
independent extracts were tested for each cell line. (B) Immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts (500mg) and DNA-cellulose fractions as indicated from V3
transfectants expressing wild-type DNA-PKcs (lanes 1 and 3) and LRRm1 (lanes 2 and 4). (C) Densitometric analyses of immunoblots from three independent
experiments assessing DNA-cellulose fractionation of wild-type DNA-PKcs and LRRm1. Error bars, standard error of the mean. (D) Immunoblot analyses of Ni+

cellulose in both salt concentrations (50 and 150 mM). How-
ever, fractionation of wild-type DNA-PKcs onto DNA cellu-
lose is markedly enhanced in low salt concentrations. In
contrast, reducing the salt concentration has little affect on
DNA-cellulose fractionation of LRRm1. Finally, if the
LRRm1 mutant depends primarily on Ku for its interaction
with DNA, we reasoned that addition of excess Ku might
enhance the fractionation of the mutant onto DNA cellulose.
Thus, DNA cellulose binding was assessed in the presence or
absence of excess recombinant Ku. As can be seen, fractiona-
tion of LRRm1 is substantially increased by the addition of
excess Ku. These data are consistent with a model whereby
the LRR of DNA-PKcs contributes to its intrinsic affinity
for DNA.
DISCUSSION
C1D is a nuclear matrix associated protein and binds DNA
with very high affinity (19). Previous work from Jackson and
colleagues had shown that DNA-PKcs interacts directly with
C1D both in vitro and in vivo (18). The authors inferred that
this interaction requires an intact LRR region because in a
yeast two-hybrid experiment, a DNA-PKcs fragment with the
LRR mutated failed to interact with C1D. Thus, at the onset of
our studies, our working model was that DNA-PKcs is targeted
to the nuclear matrix or chromatin network via its interaction
with C1D and after DNA damage, Ku targets DNA-PKcs to
DNA ends. To test this model, we introduced two mutations in
the LRR region of DNA-PKcs (E1516D, L1517P) that are
identical to the construct used in the previous yeast two-
hybrid studies. When expressed in DNA-PKcs deficient
cells, the LRR mutant could only partially reverse their
NHEJ deficits. However (to our surprise), when tested for
its interaction with C1D, the LRR mutant was found not
only to interact normally with C1D in vitro, but was also
efficiently mobilized to nuclear matrix in response to DNA
damage in living cells. Thus, the NHEJ deficits in cells
expressing the mutant protein could not be attributed to
defective targeting of DNA-PKcs to nuclear matrix via its
interaction with C1D.
Several additional in vitro assays were performed to try to
delineate the functional deficit of the LRR mutant. Whereas
the mutant was found to have normal catalytic activity as a
protein kinase, and was able to interact as well as wild-type
DNA-PKcs with its DNA end-binding partner, Ku, the mutant
did not fractionate onto DNA cellulose as well as wild-type
DNA-PKcs. The difference in DNA cellulose binding was
consistently most dramatic in low salt conditions when
DNA-PKcs can interact with DNA both via its interaction
with Ku and via its own intrinsic affinity for DNA (34–36).
Thus, we propose that the LRR of DNA-PKcs contributes to
the intrinsic ability of DNA-PKcs to bind DNA, and that its
intrinsic DNA affinity is functionally important.
Figure 5. The LRR contributes to DNA-PKcs’s intrinsic affinity for DNA but not its interaction with Ku. (A) Whole cell extract from Sf9 cells infected with
baculovirus expressing His-tagged Ku was incubated with Ni+ agarose beads. Beads were washed and analyzed for Ku expression by SDS–PAGE followed by
Coomassie blue staining. (B) Immunoblotting of Ni+ agarose fractions of whole cell extracts (2 mg) from V3 transfectants expressing either wild-type DNA-PKcs
(lanes1 and 4) or LRRm1 (lanes 2 and 5) incubated with whole cell lysate from either control virus infected-Sf9 cells or Ku-infected Sf9 cells as indicated. (C)

the total lysates input. (D) Immunoblot analysis of DNA-cellulose fractions of extracts (500 mg) from V3 transfectants expressing wild-type (WT) DNA-PKcs (lane

Our hypothesis is consistent with recent structural studies of
DNA-PKcs (17,18). Llorca and colleagues have demonstrated
that the palm region of DNA-PKcs undergoes a conforma-
tional change when bound to a DSB. The palm domain con-
tains two ‘claws’ (proximal and distal) that likely facilitate
DNA binding. The LRR resides in the proximal claw possibly
explaining the DNA-binding deficits of the LRR mutant.
These data, in concert with emerging data from our laboratory
and others (4,7,8,14), suggest that after targeting to sites of
DNA damage by Ku (and possibly C1D), DNA-PKcs
regulates DNA end access via its direct interaction with
DNA termini, and then regulates end access by a series of
autophosphorylation-induced conformational changes.
