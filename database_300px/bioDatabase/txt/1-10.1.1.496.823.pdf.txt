Abstract: Apoptosis of B cell chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells is regulated by the
PI-3K-Akt pathway. In the present work, we have
analyzed the mechanisms of Akt phosphorylation in
B-CLL cells. Freshly isolated cells present basal
Akt phosphorylation, which is PI-3K-dependent, as
incubation with the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 de-
creased Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation in
most samples analyzed (seven out of 10). In three
out of 10 cases, inhibition of protein kinase C
(PKC) inhibited basal Akt phosphorylation. Stro-
mal cell-derived factor-1, IL-4, and B cell recep-
tor activation induced PI-3K-dependent Akt phos-
phorylation. PMA induced the phosphorylation of
Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 and the phosphoryla-
tion of Akt substrates, independently of PI-3K in
B-CLL cells. In contrast, PKC-mediated phosphor-
ylation of Akt was PI-3K-dependent in normal B
cells. Finally, a specific inhibitor of PKC blocked
the phosphorylation and activation of Akt by PMA
in B-CLL cells. Taken together, these results sug-
gest a model in which Akt could be activated by two
different pathways (PI-3K and PKC) in B-CLL
cells. J. Leukoc. Biol. 80: 000–000; 2006.
Key Words: apoptosis  signal transduction
INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)
cells is regulated by multiple signal transduction pathways
(reviewed in ref. [1]). Several reports have described the role of
PI-3K in B-CLL cell survival [2–10]. Thus, it has recently been
reported that inhibition of constitutively activated PI-3K in-
duces apoptosis in B-CLL cells [4, 5]. Moreover, PI-3K inhi-
bition increases the sensitivity of B-CLL cells to fludarabine,
dexamethasone, and chlorambucil ex vivo [4, 6] and blocks the
survival effect of engagement of the antigen receptor, phorbol
esters, IL-4, albumin, and lysophosphatidic acid in B-CLL
cells [2, 4, 8–10].
The most characterized target of PI-3K involved in cell
survival is Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), which
is a point of convergence of several signaling pathways in-
volved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and me-
tabolism in most cell types including B lymphocytes [11–13].
It is important that deregulation of Akt has been implicated in
the development of human cancer, and this kinase could be a
target for cancer therapy [14–16]. Akt resides in the cytosol in
a low-activity conformation, and it is activated through recruit-
ment to cell membranes by PI-3K lipid products and phos-
phorylation. Akt phosphorylation occurs at the catalytic do-
main (Thr-308) by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1
(PDK-1) [17]. The mechanism leading to phosphorylation of
Ser-473 is unclear [18, 19], and candidate Ser-473 kinases
include MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) [20, 21],
DNA-dependent protein kinase [22], PKC [23], and Rictor-
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex [24]. Active
Akt phosphorylates and inactivates multiple proteins involved
in the control of apoptosis, including Bad, caspase-9, glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and the Forkhead family of tran-
scription factors [11, 13, 14].
Although several recent reports propose a role for Akt in
B-CLL cell survival [4, 6–8], the regulation of Akt and its role
in the survival of B-CLL cells are poorly characterized. First, it
is controversial whether B-CLL cells present basal Akt activity
[4–8]. Second, it is not clear whether the phosphorylation of
Akt is dependent on PI-3K. Thus, inhibition of PI-3K de-
creases Akt phosphorylation induced by plasma [3], anti-IgM
[2], IL-4 [4], or albumin [6]; however, it does not affect PKC-
induced Akt phosphorylation [4]. Third, although phorbol es-
ters and survival signals induce phosphorylation of Akt in
Ser-473 [4], the effect on the phosphorylation of Thr-308,
necessary for full activation of Akt, has not been analyzed.
Here, we examine the signal transduction pathways involved in
the phosphorylation and activation of Akt in B-CLL cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cytokines and chemical reagents
PMA, staurosporine (Ssp), and PMSF were purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant human IL-4 and stromal cell-derived fac-
tor-1 (SDF-1) were purchased from Immunotools (Friesoythe, Germany).
Bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I), SB203580, PD98059 and LY294002 were
purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). LY333531 and
SH-5 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). Goat
F(ab)2 anti-human IgM was purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associ-
ates (Birmingham, AL), and Triciribine was purchased from Biaffin GmbH and
Co KG (Kassel, Germany).
B-CLL patients and cell isolation
B-CLL was diagnosed according to standard clinical and laboratory criteria.
Cells were obtained from the Hospital de Bellvitge, L’Hospitalet de Llobregat
(Spain). Written, informed consent was obtained from all patients. Mononu-
clear cells from peripheral blood samples were isolated by centrifugation on a
Ficoll/Hypaque (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) gradient and cryopreserved in
liquid nitrogen in the presence of 10% DMSO.
Normal B and T lymphocyte isolation
Four whole blood samples from healthy donors were obtained from the Hospital
de Bellvitge, L’Hospitalet de Llobregat. B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes were
isolated using RosetteSepTM human B cell or RosetteSepTM human T cell
enrichment cocktails (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Briefly, 1
ml RosetteSepTM was added to 20 ml whole blood. The mixed solution was
incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Then, the sample was diluted with
an equal volume of PBS plus 2% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco-Invitrogen,
Frederick, MD), layered on the top of Ficoll/Hypaque medium, and centrifuged
at 1200 g for 20 min. B or T cells were removed from the density medium/
plasma interface and washed twice with PBS plus 2% FBS before culture.
Cell culture
Cells were cultured at a concentration of 5  106 cells/ml in RPMI-1640
culture medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Biological Industries, Kibbutz, Beit Haemek, Israel)
and 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% carbon dioxide.
Flow cytometry analysis of cell viability
Cell viability was determined simultaneously by double-staining with FITC-
conjugated annexin V (Bender MedSystem, Vienna, Austria) and propidium
iodide (PI), as described previously [4]. Briefly, 2  105 B-CLL cells were
washed in PBS and resuspended in 100 L annexin V binding buffer (10 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 140 mM NaCl) containing 1 l FITC annexin
V. After 15 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature, cells were
diluted with 100 l annexin V binding buffer containing 1 g/ml PI and
analyzed with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data analysis
was performed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Cell viability was
measured as the percentage of annexin V- and PI-negative cells.
Western blot analysis of protein phosphorylation
Lymphocytes from B-CLL patients were incubated at a density of 5  106
cells/ml for the indicated period of time, washed in ice-cold PBS, resuspended
in lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 40 mM -glycerophos-
phate, 100 mM NaCl, 1 g/ml pepstatin, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml aprotinin,
1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PMSF), and incubated on ice for 15 min. After
1 min of vortexing, lysates were spun at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4°C,
supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined using
the Micro bicinchoninic protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For
detection of phosphorylated forms of Akt, 50 g each protein lysate was
separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P mem-
branes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and analyzed by Western blotting. After
binding with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, blots were visualized with
the ECL detection system (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Antibodies against phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204),
phospho-FoxO3 (member of the Forkhead box O family), and phospho-sub-
strates of Akt were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA).
The antibody against phospho-Akt (Thr-308) was purchased from Affinity
(Golden, CO), and the antibody against phospho-GSK3/ was from Upstate
Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). As a confirmation of equal loading and
transfer proteins, blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total
Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA), ERK (Upstate Biotechnology), or
-tubulin (Sigma Chemical Co.).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using the SPSS (Chicago, IL) 11.5 software package.
Results are shown as mean  SEM of values obtained in independent experi-
ments. The Student’s t-test was used to compare the differences between
samples.
RESULTS
Role of PI-3K and PKC in basal Akt
phosphorylation
First, we analyzed the basal phosphorylation state of Akt in
freshly isolated and cryopreserved B-CLL cells from 12 differ-
ent patients. Comparison of freshly isolated with cryopreserved
cells showed that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-
308 was lost after isolation and one cryopreservation/thawing
cycle (Fig. 1A). This basal Akt phosphorylation present in
fresh cells is PI-3K-dependent, as incubation with the PI-3K
inhibitor LY294002 decreased Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphor-
ylation in most samples analyzed (seven out of 10; Fig. 1B,
Patients 5–7). In addition, in three out of 10 samples, basal Akt
phosphorylation was PKC-dependent, as incubation with the
Fig. 1. B-CLL cells have constitutive Akt activity, which is blocked by PI-3K
or PKC inhibition. (A) Akt is phosphorylated (P-Akt) at Ser-473 and Thr-308
in freshly isolated, primary B-CLL lymphocytes. Freshly isolated B-CLL cells
were lysed 1 h after separation from peripheral blood (freshly isolated, F) or 1 h
after thawing (cryopreserved, C). Representative results with fresh or cryopre-
served samples derived from four patients from 12 analyzed are shown. (B)
Fresh B-CLL cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 20 M LY294002,
5 M Bis I, or in medium alone (Ct). Representative results with fresh samples
derived from four patients out of 10 analyzed are shown. Whole protein lysates
from different samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific anti-
bodies as indicated.

PKC inhibitor Bis I decreased Ser-473 and Thr-308 (Fig. 1B,
Patient 6) or Ser-473 Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, Patient 7).
Finally, in some samples (three out of 10), basal Akt phos-
phorylation was not affected by PI-3K or PKC inhibitors (Fig.
1B, Patient 8).
Two candidates to maintain basal Akt phosphorylation in
B-CLL cells are SDF-1 and IL-4, which are synthesized by
nurse-like cells and T lymphocytes, respectively, and induce
survival of B-CLL cells [4, 25]. SDF-1 induced Akt phos-
phorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 (Fig. 2A). This phosphor-
ylation was inhibited by LY294002 but not by Bis I (n3),
indicating that SDF-1 induced Akt phosphorylation by a
PI-3K-dependent mechanism. Similar results were obtained
with IL-4 and CD40 ligand (data not shown). Furthermore,
activation of BCR induced Akt phosphorylation by a PKC-
independent and PI-3K-dependent mechanism. In contrast,
PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation was not inhibited by
LY294002 (Fig. 2A).
To examine whether this PMA-induced, PI-3K-independent
phosphorylation of Ser-473 was specific to B-CLL cells, we
analyzed the effect of PMA on Akt phosphorylation in several
cell lines and in normal B and T lymphocytes. PMA did not
induce Ser-473 phosphorylation in any of the cell lines ana-
lyzed, including EHEB (human B cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia), JVM-2 (human B-prolymphocytic leukemia),
BAF-3 (mouse pro B cells), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma),
and Swiss 3T3 (mouse Swiss albino embryo fibroblasts; data
not shown). Similarly to B-CLL cells, treatment of human B and
T lymphocytes from normal donors with PMA induced the
phosphorylation of Ser-473 and Thr-308, and this phosphory-
lation was inhibited by Bis I. In contrast to B-CLL and normal
T cells, PMA-induced phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited by
LY294002 in normal B cells (n2; Fig. 2B).
PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation activates Akt
in B-CLL cells
To further characterize Akt phosphorylation by PMA, dose-
response and time-course experiments were performed in B-
CLL cells. PMA induced Ser-473 phosphorylation at 10 nM in
all cases analyzed (n4; Fig. 3A). Incubation of cells with
PMA induced Ser-473 phosphorylation after 1 min, with a peak
at 10–30 min, which was maintained for at least 6 h in all
cases analyzed (n5; Fig. 3B).
We next analyzed whether PMA treatment increases Akt
activity in B-CLL cells using phospho-specific antibodies gen-
erated against the Akt substrate consensus sequence [26]. As
expected, some Akt substrates were phosphorylated in basal
conditions from freshly isolated cells, and LY294002 and Bis
I treatment decreased this phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). It is
important that treatment with PMA increased the phosphory-
lation of several Akt substrates. The most prominent phosphor-
ylated Akt substrates had an apparent molecular mass of 30,
52, 66, 80, 95, and 120 kDa. PMA-induced phosphorylation of
these proteins was not inhibited by LY294002 (only phosphor-
ylation of 30-kDa protein was slightly decreased) and com-
pletely blocked by Bis I. The 30-kDa protein has been iden-
tified previously as S6 ribosomal protein [26]. Using specific
antibodies against known Akt substrates, we found that the
52-kDa and the 95-kDa proteins correspond to GSK3 and
FoxO3, respectively (Fig. 4B).
Effect of protein kinase inhibitors on PKC-
induced Akt phosphorylation
To analyze the signal transduction pathways involved in PMA-
induced Akt phosphorylation, we used selective protein kinase
inhibitors (Fig. 5). As previously shown, the effect of PMA on
Akt phosphorylation was blocked completely by Bis I, a selec-
tive inhibitor of classical and novel isoforms of PKC. The
p38-MK2 and MEK-ERK pathways are activated downstream
of PKC. However, inhibition of p38 MAPK and MEK by
SB203580 and PD98059, respectively, did not affect Ser-473
phosphorylation. Furthermore, our results show that PMA-

for 1 h with 20 M LY294002 or 5 M Bis I and incubated with 10 nM PMA,

20 min (n3). (B) Normal B and T cells were preincubated in the presence of
20 M LY294002 or 5 M Bis I for 1 h prior to stimulation with 10 nM PMA

analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies as indicated.

centrations of PMA for 20 min or (B) with 10 nM PMA for the indicated periods

phosphorylation in Ser-473 was analyzed by Western blot as described in
Materials and Methods. Results from one representative patient sample are
shown.

induced Ser-473 phosphorylation was blocked completely by
50 nM Ssp, indicating that a Ssp-sensitive kinase is involved in
this phosphorylation in B-CLL cells. Neither SH-5, which
prevents phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binding to PH do-
main, nor triciribine, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation,
inhibited PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Finally,
neither mTOR nor calmodulin-dependent pathways play a role
in PKC-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation in B-CLL cells, as
rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR) and W13 (an inhibitor of
calmodulin-dependent proteins) did not affect PMA-induced
Akt phosphorylation (data not shown).
PKC induces Akt phosphorylation
independently of PI-3K in B-CLL cells
While we were performing the present study, it was reported
that classic PKC isoforms, particularly, PKCII, can regulate
Akt activity by directly phosphorylating the critical residue
Ser-473 in vitro and in FcεRI-stimulated mast cells [23]. Thus,
we examined whether Akt phosphorylation depends on the
activity of this PKC isoform. As shown in Figure 6A, Akt
phosphorylation on Ser-473 and Thr-308 was inhibited by the
PKC inhibitor LY333531 [27] in a dose-dependent manner.
Time-course experiments showed that inhibition of PKC
blocked Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 at all
times analyzed (Fig. 6B). In contrast, PKC was not required
for Ser-473 phosphorylation in B-CLL cells stimulated with
IgM or SDF-1 (Fig. 6C). Basal and PMA-induced phosphor-
ylation of Akt substrates was inhibited by LY333531 (Fig. 6D),
indicating that a PKC-dependent pathway activates Akt in
B-CLL cells. Similarly to B-CLL cells, treatment of human B
and T lymphocytes from normal donors with PMA induced the
phosphorylation of Ser-473 and Thr-308, and this phosphory-
lation was inhibited by LY333531 (Fig. 6E). It is surprisingly
that 1 M LY333531, a dose that inhibited PMA-induced Akt
phosphorylation, did not affect viability of B-CLL cells from six
different patients (control, 60%11%; PMA, 73%8%;
LY333531, 59%18%; PMA	LY333531, 74%11%). Fi-
nally, we analyzed the effect of the combination of LY294002
and PKC inhibitors on the viability of B-CLL cells. Bis I and
LY294002 had an additive effect, but LY333531 did not
increase the apoptotic effect of LY294002 (Fig. 7).
DISCUSSION
Our results show that PKC induces the phosphorylation and
activation of Akt independently of PI-3K in B-CLL cells.
Activation of PKC is sufficient to induce Akt phosphorylation
in some cell types [4, 23, 28–35]. Thus, we reported that
phorbol esters induce Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473, inde-
pendently of PI-3K [4]. In addition, it has been reported that
incubation of human platelets with phorbol esters induces Akt
phosphorylation [32, 33] and that phorbol esters induce Akt
phosphorylation in murine T lymphocytes and the myeloid cell
line FDC-P1 [34, 35].
PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Akt is independent of
PI-3K in B-CLL cells and in normal T cells, but it is surprising

that this phosphorylation depends on PI-3K in normal B lym-
phocytes. The reason for this difference is unknown. One
possibility is that B-CLL cells have lost this dependency
during transformation. A second possibility is that this is a
characteristic of the normal B cell subpopulation from which
B-CLL cells develop. In fact, B-CLL cells express CD5 and
ZAP-70, two proteins that are expressed in normal T cells but
not in normal B cells [36]. The understanding of this difference
between B-CLL cells and normal B lymphocytes could be
exploited in the future for a more targeted and selective ther-
apy.
Recently, it has been reported that classic PKC isoforms,
particularly PKCII, regulate Akt activity by directly phos-
phorylating the critical residue Ser-473 in vitro and in FcεRI-
stimulated mast cells [23]. Thus, PKC is a candidate to
directly phosphorylate Akt at Ser-473 in B-CLL cells. Whether
or not PKC is involved in the phosphorylation of Akt in
platelets and myeloid cells is unknown. Our results indicate
that PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation in normal human B
and T lymphocytes is dependent of PKC. B-CLL cells express
high levels of PKC protein [37], and this raises the possibility
that PKC could be deregulated in these leukemia cells.
Furthermore, it is possible that PKC plays a role in the
activation of Akt in other leukemias.
In vitro studies demonstrate that PKC directly phosphor-
ylates Akt at Ser-473 without affecting the phosphorylation
status of the Thr-308 residue [23]. However, in B-CLL cells,
inhibition of PKC decreases Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphor-
ylation. As Thr-308 phosphorylation is not inhibited by
LY294002 in response to PMA, these results suggest that a
protein kinase acting downstream of PKC mediates the phos-
phorylation of Thr-308 independently of PI-3K in B-CLL cells.
Alternatively, PKC could induce the activation of PDK-1
independently of PI-3K, as reported for the tyrosine kinase
rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinomas [38].
Finally, the decrease in Thr-308 phosphorylation induced by
LY333531 is also consistent with the model, in which Ser-473
phosphorylation precedes the phosphorylation of Thr-308 by
constitutively active PDK-1 [18, 39].
It is interesting that inhibition of PKC-induced Akt activity
did not affect viability of B-CLL cells. These results indicate
that Akt activity is not essential for the survival effect of PKC
activation and that other pathways induced by PKC are suffi-
cient to maintain cell viability. Whether or not Akt activation
is essential for the survival effect of SDF-1 and IL-4 is
presently unknown. Although the inhibition of PI-3K blocks
the survival effect of IL-4, LY294002 induces apoptosis in
cryopreserved cells with dephosphorylated Akt [4], suggesting
the existence of other critical survival pathways downstream of
PI-3K. Finally, Bis I but not PKC inhibitor has additive
effects on apoptosis induction when combined with the PI-3K
inhibitor. This suggests that when PKC is inhibited, other
PKC-dependent survival pathways remain activated in B-CLL
cells.

Barraga´n et al. Regulation of Akt in B-CLL cells 5
In conclusion, these results and those reported previously
[2–4] indicate that B-CLL cells have two convergent signal
transduction pathways to phosphorylate and activate Akt (Fig.
8). The first pathway is PI-3K-dependent and corresponds to
the classical PI-3K-Akt pathway described in most models.
This pathway is activated by BCR engagement [2], albumin [3],
IL-4 [4], lysophosphatidic acid [9], and SDF-1 (this report;
ref. [40]) in B-CLL cells and involves PDK-1 and probably the
recently identified Ser-473 kinase Rictor-mTOR complex [24].
The second pathway depends on PKC, is independent of
PI-3K, and contributes to the basal-constitutive Akt activity
present in B-CLL cells. Finally, these results suggest that
multiple redundant pathways are involved in the survival of
B-CLL cells, and that likely, it is necessary to analyze the
complex network of survival pathways to select the best ther-
apeutic targets.

Fig. 8. Signal transduction pathways involved in the activation of Akt in
B-CLL cells. Proposed mechanisms for basal and induced Akt activation in
response to different survival factors. B-CLL cells present a basal Akt phos-
phorylation dependent on PI-3K and PKC basal activities (marked in gray).
Different survival factors induce Akt activation in B-CLL cells by two different
pathways: the classical pathway (PI-3K-dependent), which is induced by IL-4,
SDF-1, BCR, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and the novel pathway
proposed in this manuscript, which is induced by PKC activation. Dotted line
represents an unknown pathway to explain the increase in Thr-308 phosphor-
ylation induced by PKC (see Discussion).
