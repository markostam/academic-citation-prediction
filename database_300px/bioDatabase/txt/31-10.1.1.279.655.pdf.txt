ABSTRACT
TransportDB (http://www.membranetransport.org/)
is a comprehensive database resource of informa-
tion on cytoplasmic membrane transporters and
outer membrane channels in organisms whose
complete genome sequences are available. The
complete set of membrane transport systems and
outer membrane channels of each organism are
annotated based on a series of experimental and
bioinformatic evidence and classified into different
types and families according to their mode of
transport, bioenergetics, molecular phylogeny and
substrate specificities. User-friendly web interfaces
are designed for easy access, query and download
of the data. Features of the TransportDB website
include text-based and BLAST search tools against
known transporter and outer membrane channel
proteins; comparison of transporter and outer mem-
brane channel contents from different organisms;
known 3D structures of transporters, and phylo-
genetic trees of transporter families. On individual
proteinpages, users can finddetailed functional anno-
tation, supporting bioinformatic evidence, protein/
DNA sequences, publications and cross-referenced
external online resource links. TransportDB has now
been in existence for over 10 years and continues to
be regularly updated with new evidence and data
from newly sequenced genomes, as well as having
new features added periodically.
INTRODUCTION
Membrane transporters are a large group of proteins that span
the cell membrane and form an intricate system of pumps and
channels through which they deliver essential nutrients, eject
waste products and assist the cell to sense environmental
conditions. Transporters represent a large and diverse group
of proteins that differ in membrane topology, energy coupling
mechanism and substrate specificities. They play indispens-
able roles in the fundamental cellular processes of all organ-
isms (1).
With the advent of the genomics era, comprehensive
genome-wide bioinformatic comparisons of predicted mem-
brane transporters across a range of organisms in all three
domains of life have become possible. Previously, we have
reported a series of comparative analyses of transport systems
in a collection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (2–4).
We started a web portal showing our bioinformatic prediction
of transporters in sequenced genomes back in 1996, and have
had a continual web presence since then. The current incarna-
tion of TransportDB dates back to 2002, when we moved to a
relational database structure and greatly enhanced the avail-
able features (5). The aim of TransportDB is to present the
comprehensive transporter profiles of each sequenced
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, as well as to provide
comparative and phylogenetic tools to view, search, compare
and download the transporter data in an easy-to-navigate for-
mat. We describe in this paper the data content and web fea-
tures of TransportDB, with a focus on the recent additions
and improvements.
DATABASE STRUCTURE AND CONTENT
TransportDB uses a relational database to store all the data
associated with membrane transporters and outer membrane
channels. It was built specifically to hold many different gen-
omes and to allow cross-genome queries and comparisons.
TransportDB database consists of 20 tables and is imple-
mented in MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/). Data stored in
TransportDB database can be accessed using Structured
Query Language (SQL). Users can search TransportDB via
a web interface which facilitates building a custom query
without interacting directly with the database. Examples
include searches for transporter class, family, protein and
substrate. The relational database format also allows users

to select a subset of organisms of their interest and compare
the overall transporter features as well as each individual
transporter family.
TransportDB adopts a ‘3-tier’ database architecture. The
top tier of TransportDB is the user web interface. It sends
the requests for data, formats the output of the query and dis-
plays it on the web. The Application Programmer Interface
(API), or middle tier, connects the database and retrieves
datasets by explicit keys (e.g. the name of a transporter
gene) using a single query. We adopt PHP (http://www.php.
net/), a widely used server-side scripting language, as our
API. The database itself is the bottom tier. This architecture
enables the web application to utilize SQL to query the data-
base, while not limiting the top tier to any specific database
system.
TransportDB stores the complete array of predicted trans-
porters and outer membrane channels from various prokaryotic
and eukaryotic organisms, with detailed information and sup-
porting evidence for each protein. Figure 1 shows the evolution
of data collection in TransportDB. When we moved to a rela-
tional database format in 2002, we had bioinformatic analyses
of 54 organisms and over 10 000 transporter genes (5). During
the past 4 years, a very considerable number of organisms
have been added to the database and the total number of
annotated transporter genes has increased by a factor of
seven. Currently, TransportDB contains data from 248 organ-
isms, including 197 bacteria, 24 archaea and 27 eukaryota.
This collection of organisms represents a broad phylogenetic
diversity. A total of 71 659 transport proteins and 4790 outer
membrane channels have been annotated and assigned to
183 families according to the TC classification system (1,6).
These families are further classified into different types
according to their transport mode and energy coupling mecha-
nism: seven families of primary active transporter that couple
the transport process with a primary energy source (e.g. ATP
hydrolysis); 83 families of secondary transporter that utilize
an ion or solute electrochemical gradient; 33 families of
energy-independent channels; two families of group transloca-
tors which modify their substrates during transport; 38 families
of porins/outer membrane channels that are prevalent in the
outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and certain
eukaryotic organelles; and 11 families with an unknown trans-
port mechanism. Transporters are unevenly distributed among
these families: some are very large superfamilies with thou-
sands of members, such as the ABC superfamily (7) (32 099
proteins annotated) and the MFS superfamily (8) (7942 pro-
teins), both of which are widely distributed across prokaryotic
and eukaryotic species; some families, however, only exist
in a very limited phylogenetic spectrum and/or are present in
only limited numbers.
DATABASE ACCESS AND WEB FEATURES

There are several ways for users to access data stored in
TransportDB. Users can browse the database by selecting
the organism from drop-down boxes on the left of the web
page, or by clicking the links from the ‘Organism List’
page (Figure 2). All the transport proteins are listed in a
tabular format with predicted substrate or function. A hier-
archical top-down structure was deployed for easy data
access, which arranges transporters in the orders of kingdom
(bacteria, archaea or eukaryota), organism, transporter type,
transporter family/subfamily and transport protein. Each
transport protein is presented in separate web pages where
users can find detailed information such as transporter
substrate/function annotation, TC classification, transmem-
brane segment prediction by TMHMM (9), genomic locus
information, protein/DNA sequence, etc. Evidence types
associated with functional annotation are included, such as
hidden Markov models [Pfam (10) and TIGRfam (11)],
BLAST (12) and COG (13) data. Cross-referenced links to
external database are also provided, including Entrez Gene
(14), TIGR’s Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR)
(15), MIPS (16), EcoCyc (17) and PubMed. A keyword-
based text search is available for users to search by criteria
such as transporter type, transporter family, transporter pro-
tein name or substrate. The results are grouped
by transporter family and organism. Each result contains
links to individual family and protein pages. The protein
and DNA sequences in TransportDB are readily available
for BLAST search. Users can submit a single peptide or
nucleotide sequence in the ‘Blast’ section. The output of
the BLAST search includes transporter family information
(TC number, family name) in addition to the standard
features.

The relational database format allows easy manipulation of
the data stored in TransportDB. An overview page is accessi-
ble for each organism, summarizing its complete transporter
content, including transporter types and individual transporter
families, and their statistics. Users can choose any two or
more organisms from the ‘Compare Organisms’ section to
compare their transport gene complement. All these results
are generated on the fly to reflect the most recent updates.
Figure 3. Graphic illustrations of the TransportDB web interface describing outer membrane channels. Proteins are presented in a tabular format. Each outer
membrane channel has individual pages showing supporting bioinformatic evidence, protein/DNA sequence, publications and cross-referenced external links,
etc. Users can also pull out a list of outer membrane channels from a specific organism, or a list of proteins from a specific family in all organisms.

In the ‘Phylogenetics’ section, users can view the pre-
computed neighbor-joining trees for each of the transporter
families through an ATV java applet (18). This enables
users to access the up-to-date phylogenetic trees of every
transporter family, and to manipulate the trees to display sub-
trees, zoom in and out, or collapse subtrees to single nodes,
etc. Transport proteins in each family are also available for
download in FASTA or multiple sequence alignment formats.
RECENT FEATURE ENHANCEMENT
In addition to bioinformatic predictions, we have recently
begun to comprehensively track experimental evidence for
transporter gene function based on the primary literature.
We retrieved from Entrez (19) all related publications on
transport proteins in TransportDB by e-utilities (20), which
submitted queries containing gene name and organism to
NCBI server and returned the related literature. The publica-
tions on genomic sequencing and massive gene expression
studies were manually excluded. A total of 13 936 PubMed
entries were retrieved which covers 3862 transporters and
outer membrane channels. The abstracts of all these literature
as well as links to PubMed are accessible at the individual
transporter protein pages.
A new section has been added to TransportDB describing
experimentally determined 3D structures of membrane trans-
porters from crystallization or NMR-based studies. The data
to populate this new section were derived by searching our
entire collection of transport proteins against the protein
data bank (PDB) (21). A total of 273 structures were
retrieved, representing 98 transporters (multiple structures
are available for some transporters). On the TransportDB
website, these structures are listed in a tabular format and
arranged by transporter families (Figure 2). Information on
structure description, method and resolution are included.
Cross-referenced links to PDB, PDB_TM (22), MMDB
(23), Entrez Gene and PubMed are also provided. Membrane
transporters represent 3–12% of total proteins of various
organisms (2–4). Currently there are more than 39 000 struc-
tures deposited in the PDB. Membrane transporters are highly
underrepresented and consist of <1% of all structures. This
lack of representation reflects the difficulties in the purifica-
tion and crystallization of transporter proteins due to their
hydrophobic nature and solubility only in the presence of
detergents.
Another recently added section to TransportDB describes
outer membrane channels. Gram-negative bacteria and cer-
tain eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and peroxi-
somes, are characteristically surrounded by an outer
membrane that shows little permeability for hydrophilic
solutes. Outer membrane proteins form nonspecific diffusion
channels across the outer membrane to allow the influx of
nutrients as well as the extrusion of wastes (24). A total of
4664 outer membrane channels from 142 organisms are cur-
rently annotated in TransportDB and classified into 38 fami-
lies according to the TC classification. These proteins are
listed in a tabular format in the ‘Outer Membrane Channels’
section (Figure 3). Each outer membrane channel has an indi-
vidual page showing supporting bioinformatic evidence,
protein/DNA sequences, publications and cross-referenced
external links. Users can also pull out a list of outer
membrane channels from a specific organism, or a list of pro-
teins from a specific family in all the organisms.
FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
In summary, TransportDB was developed as a relational
database for the comprehensive representation of cytoplasmic
membrane transport systems. This is the only active database
in the field dedicated to the comprehensive and comparative
study of membrane transporters and outer membrane chan-
nels in different organisms with fully sequenced genomes.
We are continuing to expand the TransportDB database to
incorporate data from newly published genomes. Trans-
portDB will be routinely updated with new annotation
information and with data from newly sequenced organisms.
New enhancements that we are focusing on for the short- to
medium-term future include the following: (i) Make our
transporter annotation pipeline available to the public through
our web portal so that they may customize it for their genome
annotation efforts. Over the past 4 years, we have undertaken
transporter annotation of over 60 unpublished genomes from
custom requests from a broad range of different research
groups (these data are not released to public until the publica-
tion of the relevant genome paper or until the genome data
has been deposited into the public databases). We believe
that providing access to our annotation pipeline through the
web will serve to fulfill the increasing demands of such
efforts. (ii) Add additional bioinformatic analyses to the
transporter annotation pipeline, such as examining the
genomic context of candidate genes, and increased use of
phylogenetic approaches. (iii) Move to using a controlled
vocabulary, a carefully selected list of words and phrases,
for membrane transporter substrate prediction, so that they
may be retrieved by searches more efficiently. The controlled
vocabulary for substrate prediction can also facilitate sub-
strate specificity comparisons and aid the automatic deriva-
tion of transport reaction equations for metabolic modeling
and flux balance analysis for different sequenced genomes.
As a starting point, we plan to use the hierarchical compound
lists that are defined in the MetaCyc database (25).
