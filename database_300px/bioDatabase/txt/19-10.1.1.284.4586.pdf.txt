ABSTRACT
Previous work has demonstrated that iron-dependent
variations in the steady-state concentration and
translatability of sodB mRNA are modulated by the
small regulatory RNA RyhB, the RNA chaperone Hfq
and RNase E. In agreement with the proposed role of
RNase E, we found that the decay of sodB mRNA is
retarded upon inactivation of RNase E in vivo, and that
the enzyme cleaves within the sodB 50-untranslated
region (50-UTR) in vitro, thereby removing the 50
stem–loop structure that facilitates Hfq and ribosome
binding. Moreover, RNase E cleavage can also occur
at a cryptic site that becomes available upon sodB 50-
UTR/RyhB base pairing. We show that while playing
an important role in facilitating the interaction of RyhB
with sodB mRNA, Hfq is not tightly retained by the
RyhB–sodB mRNA complex and can be released
from it through interaction with other RNAs added
in trans. Unlike turnover of sodB mRNA, RyhB
decay in vivo is mainly dependent on RNase III, and
its cleavage by RNase III in vitro is facilitated upon
base pairing with the sodB 50-UTR. These data are
discussed in terms of a model, which accounts for
the observed roles of RNase E and RNase III in
sodB mRNA turnover.
INTRODUCTION
RNA processing and decay play important roles in controlling
the level of particular transcripts under various growth con-
ditions (1–3). In Escherichia coli, the degradation of mRNA is
generally triggered by endoribonucleolytic cleavage, and the
resulting intermediate products are further degraded by endo-
and exoribonucleases [reviewed in (4,5)]. E.coli RNase E
seems to initiate the decay of many, if not most, mRNAs
(6–10). In some cases, the initial cleavage of transcripts can
also be performed by RNase III (11). Although the subsequent
steps of mRNA decay may sometimes require endoribonuc-
lease RNase P (12), further degradation is believed to be
accomplished by two major exoribonucleases, PNPase and
RNase II, and oligoribonuclease (13). It has also been
shown that auxiliary factors, such as RNA helicases and
Hfq (14–18), that modulate RNA structure, can significantly
affect mRNA stability.
Recent studies of the mechanisms, which are involved
in cellular responses to numerous stress conditions,
revealed that mRNA stability can be modulated by the action
of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) (19). By base pairing
with target mRNAs, sRNAs affect their translation and/or
stability (20). In contrast to the regulation by classical anti-
sense RNAs (21), base pairing of sRNA with their targets
does not require a high degree of complementarity and, there-
fore, provides a possibility for sRNAs to affect multiple
transcripts.
One of the best-studied E.coli sRNAs, RyhB, has been
recently shown (17,20) to regulate the level of the sodB
mRNA (Figure 1) encoding the iron superoxide dismutase
[FeSOD (22)]. The in vivo level of RyhB is in turn controlled
(23) by the transcriptional repressor Fur [ferric uptake
regulator (24)], whose ability to repress RyhB transcription
is iron-dependent. Similar to the action of other sRNAs
(25–27), the interaction of RyhB with sodB mRNA is mediated
by the E.coli RNA chaperone Hfq, which has been shown to
induce structural rearrangements within the sodB 50-
untranslated region (50-UTR) (Figure 1B) (28).
Although the formation of inhibitory complexes with
sRNAs is believed to functionally inactivate their target
mRNAs, the steps leading to subsequent disassembly and
recycling of these complexes are poorly understood (29).
The aim of this study is to recapitulate the functional inac-
tivation of the E.coli sodB mRNA by the regulatory RNA
RyhB in vitro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, plasmids, media and growth conditions
The following E.coli strains were used in this study: N3433
[rne+ (30)], N3438 [rne-3071, recA (31)], SDF204 [W3110
rnc+ TD1–17::Tn10 (32)] and SDF205 [W3110 rnc105
TD1–17::Tn10 (32)]. The E.coli strains were grown in
Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 28C.
To construct plasmid pUsod, the DNA fragment corres-
ponding to the entire sodB gene was amplified from chromo-
somal DNA of E.coli strain MC4100 (33) by PCR using
the primers SODBfw (50-GCTCTAGATAATACGACTCA-
CTATAGATACGCACAATAAGGCTATTGTACGTATG)
containing extra nucleotides corresponding to the T7 promoter
(in bold) (34) and an XbaI site (underlined) and SOD-
Brev (50-CGGGATCCGGATGCGGCGA-GTGCCTTATCC)
Figure 1. Alternative structures of the sodB 50-UTR. (A) 30S ribosome subunit binding and subsequent formation of the translation initiation complex is believed to
limit the access of Hfq, RyhB and/or RNase E (Rne) to the 50 end of the sodB transcript. (B) In the absence of translation, the sodB 50-leader apparently forms two
alternative structures that were previously characterized by Geissman and Touati (28). The transition between these alternative structures is mediated by Hfq and
determines the ability of the sodB mRNA to base pair with the small regulatory RNA RyhB (28). Indicated are two regions, which interact with Hfq and base pair with
RyhB, respectively. The start codon of the sodB mRNA is underlined. The major RNase E cleavage site (black arrow) and an extra RNase E site (open arrow), which
becomes available upon RyhB binding, were mapped during the course of this work (for details, see Figure 3). (C) The bars schematically depict sodB192 and
sodB151 mRNAs. The positions of the initiation codon (AUG) and the position of the 50 terminal RNase E cleavage site are indicated by black boxes and by an arrow,
respectively.

containing a BamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was
cleaved with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into plasmid pUC18
(35) digested with the same endonucleases. The plasmid
pURyhB (17) was used for RyhB RNA synthesis.
In vitro synthesis and labelling of RNA and
single-stranded DNA
The 204 nt long single-stranded anti-sod DNA, containing the
region complementary to the first 182 nt of sodB mRNA, was
amplified using the XbaI-linearized plasmid pUsod and the
50-[32P]end-labelled primer Sod-rev (50-CAGGTTGTTCAG-
GTTAGTGAC) by an asymmetric PCR, and then gel-purified.
RyhB RNA was transcribed from HindIII-linearized plasmid
pURyhB (17) using T7 RNA polymerase. The sodB192
mRNA (Figure 1C), containing the sodB 50 untranslated region
and part of the coding region (nucleotides 55 to +137) and
one G nucleotide at the 50 end, was transcribed from Asp718I-
linearized plasmid pUsod. The sodB151 mRNA (Figure 1C),
containing the truncated sodB 50 untranslated region and part
of the coding region (nucleotides 21 to +127) and three extra
G nucleotides at the 50 end, was transcribed using PCR-
amplified SodB2 template. Plasmid pUsod was used for the
amplification of SodB2 template with the following primers:
50-AATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTAATAATAAAG-
GAGAGTAGCAA TG-TCATTCG (forward primer) and
50-CAGGTTGTTCAGGTTAGTGAC (reverse primer).
Underlined nucleotides correspond to the T7 RNA polymerase
promoter (34). The RNAs were synthesized using the MEGA-
script T7 kit (Ambion), gel-purified and 50 end-labelled as
described previously (36).
Northern blot analysis
Strains were grown at 30C up to an OD600 of 0.4, and then the
temperature was shifted to 44C for 10 min before the addition
of rifampicin (0.25 mg/ml). In some experiments (for details,
see Figure legend 2), LB medium was also supplemented with
250 mM FeSO4 that was added 16 min before rifampicin treat-
ment. Total RNA was prepared from aliquots of the cultures
withdrawn at various times using the hot phenol method (37).
The RNA samples were fractionated on 4–8% polyacrylamide
gels, transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad), using
the Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad), and
then separately hybridized with [32P]labelled RNA probes
specific for sodB mRNA, RyhB RNA or 5S rRNA as described
previously (17). The signal intensities obtained with the radio-
actively labelled probes were quantitated on a PhosphorImager
(Molecular Dynamics). The relative amount of sodB mRNA
and RyhB at each time point was calculated by normalizing
their signals to 5S rRNA signal.
Gel shift assays–western blot analysis
Aliquots containing 100 fmol of 50-[32P]labelled RNA were
incubated for 10 min at 37C with or without the addition of
Hfq, which was purified as described by Vassilieva et al. (38),
and unlabelled RNAs (as indicated in the Figure legends
4 and 5) in 10 ml binding buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5,
5 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM NH4Cl and 0.5 mM DTT).
After cooling on ice and addition of glycerol to a final con-
centration of 5%, the samples were loaded on a non-denaturing
4% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed in
0.5· TBE buffer at 40 V for 10–16 h, and the radioactive
bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular
Dynamics). Thereafter, the gel was electroblotted onto
Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The blotting was carried
out in TBE buffer at 200 V for 30 min. After blotting, the
membranes were blocked in 10% non-fat dry milk suspension
and probed with anti-Hfq antibodies followed by development
using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit
(Amersham) as recently described (17).
RNase E cleavage of sodB192 RNA
Aliquots containing 100 fmol of 50-[32P]labelled RNA were
incubated for 10 min at 37C in binding buffer (10 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM NH4Cl and
0.5 mM DTT) in the presence or absence of Hfq and unlabelled
RNAs as indicated in Figure legend 3. Then, 20 ng of Rne498
(39) or 150 ng of degradosome (40) were added, and aliquots
withdrawn at various time points were further extracted with
phenol, mixed with an equal volume of loading dye solution
(90% formamide, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol FF
and 0.025% bromophenol blue), and then fractionated on 8%
polyacryamide gels containing 8 M urea. The cleavage sites
for RNase E and RNase III were mapped using endoribonuc-
lease T1 and nuclease S1 digests of the corresponding RNAs.
Briefly, 200 fmol of 50-[32P]labelled RNA were incubated with
4 U of ribonuclease S1 (MBI Fermentas) in 1· S1 buffer (MBI
Fermentas) at 70C for 1–8 min or with 0.1 U of ribonuclease
T1 (MBI Fermentas) in 1· AT buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2) at 37
C for 1–8 min.
RNase III cleavage of RyhB
Aliquots containing 40 fmol of 50-[32P]labelled RNA were
pre-incubated with 6-fold molar excess of Hfq for 5 min at
37C in 1· RNase III buffer (Ambion) in the absence or
presence of increasing quantities of unlabelled sodB192
RNA as indicated in Figure legend 7. Subsequently, 0.1 U
of RNase III (Ambion) was added, and aliquots withdrawn
at various time points were further extracted with phenol,
mixed with an equal volume of loading dye solution (90%
formamide, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol FF and
0.025% bromophenol blue), and then fractionated on a 6%
polyacryamide gels containing 8 M urea.
Toeprinting assay
The toeprinting assays were carried out using 30S ribosomal
subunits and tRNAfMet as described previously (41). The
50-[32P]labelled sodB-specific oligonucleotide Sod-rev
(50-CAGGTTGTTCAGGTTAGTGAC) complementary to
nucleotides +137 to +117 of the sodB mRNA was used as a
primer for cDNA synthesis in the toeprinting reactions. The
sodB192 RNA annealed to the primer was separated from free
oligonucleotides on a MicroSpin G-50 column according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). An
aliquot of 0.04 pmol of sodB192 mRNA annealed to Sod-rev
oligo was pre-incubated at 37C for 5 min without or with
0.5 pmol of 30S subunits and 10 pmol of tRNAfMet.
To compare the affinity of the 30S subunits for sodB192
RNA and its truncated version sodB151 RNA, increasing
amounts of either sodB192 or sodB151 mRNA were added
to the reaction mixtures after the annealing step before the
1680 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5
addition of 30S subunits, as indicated in the legend to Figure 3.
The rationale was that the RNA with a higher affinity for 30S
ribosomal subunit would compete with the sodB192 RNA
annealed to the 50-[32P]labelled oligonucleotide Sod-rev
and, therefore, would reduce the toeprint signal more
efficiently than the mRNA with a lower affinity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
RNase E- and RNase III-dependence of sodB mRNA
decay in vivo
Previous work has shown that the steady-state level of sodB
mRNA is dependent on the E.coli chaperone Hfq, the small
regulatory RNA RyhB, the transcriptional regulator Fur as
well as on RNase E (17,42). To differentiate between direct
and indirect roles of RNase E in determining the stability of the
sodB transcript, northern blot hybridization to a [32P]labelled
riboprobe complementary to sodB mRNA was used to detect
the full-length transcript in wild-type E.coli cells as well as in
an rnets mutant strain at the non-permissive temperature after
rifampicin treatment (Figure 2A). Both measurements were
performed not only when E.coli cells were cultivated in
medium with low or moderate iron content (LB) [i.e. under
conditions leading to the coupled decay of the sodB and RyhB
transcripts (42)] but also under conditions (LB + 250 mM
FeSO4) that should increase the concentration of activated
Fur, the repressor of RyhB transcription (23). The latter
was performed with the rationale to monitor the RyhB-
independent decay of sodB mRNA. In both the cases (see
Figure 2A and B), the decay of sodB mRNA was retarded
upon inactivation of RNase E, thus suggesting that the RyhB-
dependent (Figure 2A) as well as RyhB-independent
(Figure 2B) decay of this transcript is mediated by RNase E.
Nevertheless, none of the degradative intermediates could be
detected in addition to the full-length species (data not shown),
which may not be surprising because many E.coli mRNAs are
known to decay without any detectable accumulation of inter-
mediate products.
The same probe was also used to compare the rates of sodB
mRNA decay in the wild-type and its isogenic rnc mutant
lacking functional RNase III (Figure 2C and D). Interestingly,
the RyhB-dependent decay of sodB mRNA was more efficient
in the rnc mutant when compared with the wild-type strain
(Figure 2C), suggesting that RNase III does not cleave this
transcript in vivo but instead may affect the decay of this
mRNA indirectly, e.g. by changing the steady-state level of
RyhB. Consistently, the rate of sodB mRNA decay at reduced
levels of RyhB was found to be the same in the wild-type and
rnc mutant strains after 8 min of rifampicin treatment
(Figure 2D). Given that the addition of FeSO4 does not elim-
inate RyhB immediately (data not shown), RyhB apparently
affects sodB mRNA decay during the initial period (from 0 to
8 min), thereby resulting in different decay rates observed in
these strains at early time points (Figure 2D).
RNase E cleavage of sodB mRNA in vitro
The RNase E-mediated degradation of E.coli mRNAs is
usually initiated within their 50-UTRs, which are normally
not protected by ribosomes and, therefore, serve as primary
targets for RNA-binding proteins and endonucleases. To test
whether RNase E also cleaves within the 50-UTR of the sodB
transcript, we separately incubated 50 end-labelled sodB192
RNA, which corresponds to nucleotide 56 to +136 of E.coli
sodB mRNA (see Figure 1C), with affinity-purified RNase E
(Rne498, residues 1–498) and E.coli degradosome (Figure 3A
and B, respectively). As shown in Figure 3, RNase E cleavage
of sodB192 occurred at position U21, and the cleavage
efficiency at this site was decreased in the presence of Hfq
(Figure 3A, lanes 13–15). The latter is consistent with the
previously documented ability of Hfq to bind in close vicinity
of RNase E cleavage sites, thereby protecting RNase E
substrates from the nuclease activity of this enzyme (15).
Moreover, we found that the structural changes, which are
induced in the 50-UTR of sodB mRNA upon binding to the
regulatory RNA RyhB (28), affect the cleavage pattern. As
shown in Figure 3A (compare lanes 18–20 with lanes 13–15)
and Figure 3B (compare lanes 8–10 with lanes 3–5), an addi-
tional RNase E cleavage site was mapped downstream of the
translational start, namely at position A+12 (Figure 3D). This
observation suggests that base pairing with RyhB, which
stimulates RNase E cleavage downstream of the start codon
(see also Figure 1A), can trigger another pathway for sodB
mRNA turnover in vivo.
RNase E cleavage within the 50-UTR of sodB mRNA
decreases its affinity for Hfq and ribosomes
Given that the sodB 50-UTR is the location of the Hfq (28) and
ribosome binding sites, we next investigated whether RNase E
cleavage at the 50 end of the sodB mRNA (see Figure 1B) leads
to functional inactivation of the transcript, i.e. whether the
truncated form of the sodB mRNA generated by cleavage at
position U21 (Figure 1C, sodB152) is still able to bind Hfq
and to interact with 30S ribosomes. First, the affinity of
sodB192 and its truncated form sodB151 to Hfq was compared
by means of gel-shift assays. As shown in Figure 4A, although
both [32P]labelled transcripts (sodB192 and sodB151) can bind
Hfq, the truncated form (sodB151) has lower affinity. This
suggested that the 50 terminal hairpin structure facilitates
Hfq binding. Likewise, the presence of this structure appears
to confer higher affinity for ribosomes. This was revealed by
comparing the ability of both transcripts (sodB192 and
sodB151) to interfere with translation inhibition on sodB192
RNA (Figure 4B and C). As shown by toeprint analysis
(Figure 4B), sodB151 RNA was required in higher concentra-
tions than sodB192 RNA to achieve the same inhibitory effect
on ribosome binding (Figure 4C).
Analysis of Hfq binding to and recycling from the
RyhB–sodB 50-UTR complex
Previous work has suggested that Hfq binding induces struc-
tural changes within the 50-UTR of the sodB transcript, which
facilitate base pairing with the small regulatory RNA RyhB
(28). To study in more detail the composition of the inhibitory
complex formed between RyhB and sodB mRNA, we
employed gel-shift assays. Radioactively labelled sodB192
RNA (Figure 1C) was incubated with increasing amounts
of RyhB in the absence (Figure 5A, lanes 2–5) or presence
(Figure 5A, lanes 7–10) of Hfq, and the resulting complexes
were analysed on a native polyacrylamide gel. As anticipated,
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5 1681
base pairing of RyhB with sodB192 RNA is strongly facilit-
ated by Hfq. To test whether the resulting complex also con-
tained Hfq, selected samples, which are shown in lanes 1, 6 and
10 of Figure 5A, were resolved on a separate gel, and the gel
was blotted onto a PVDF membrane followed by probing with
anti-Hfq antibodies (Figure 5B). As revealed by immuno-
detection, Hfq was part of the complex (marked by asterisks)
formed by the base paired RNAs. Vice versa, labelling of
Figure 2. RNase E- and RNase III-dependence of sodB mRNA stability in vivo. E.coli strains and isogenic RNase E (rnets) and RNase III (rnc) mutants were grown
either in LB medium (LB) or in LB medium supplemented with 250 mM FeSO4 (LB + 250 mM FeSO4) before rifampicin treatment, thereby favouring either RyhB-
dependent (A and C) or RyhB-independent (B and D) sodB mRNA decay, respectively. RNA samples prepared from the above cultures before and after rifampicin
treatment at the times indicated on top were analysed by northern blotting using probes specific for the sodB transcript and 5S rRNA. The latter was employed as an
internal standard for normalization of sodB-specific signals. The graph at the bottom of each panel shows the relative amount of sodB mRNA remaining at each time
point as determined by phosphorimaging, and plotted as a function of time.
1682 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5
RyhB confirmed that base pairing with sodB192 is inefficient
in the absence of Hfq (Figure 5C, compare lanes 2–5 with
lane 7). Moreover, by the addition of increasing amounts
of sodB192 to the preformed ternary complex containing
both RNAs and Hfq (lane 7), Hfq was apparently released
from the ternary complex (lanes 8–10), resulting in a species
(indicated by a single circle) that migrates at the position of the
binary RyhB–sodB192 complex. Therefore, although Hfq-
mediated base pairing of sRNAs with their target does not
simultaneously result in its release from the complex, these
data might suggest that Hfq recycling occurs via interactions
with other Hfq ligands.
RNase E-independent and RNase III-dependent decay
of RyhB in vivo
Masse and Gottesman (20) have recently shown that inactiva-
tion of RNase E results in an increase in the steady-state level
Figure 3. RNase E cleavage within the sodB 50-UTR. 50-[32P]labelled sodB192 was incubated either with RNase E polypeptide (Rne498, residues 1–498) or with
RNA degradosome (40) in the presence or absence of Hfq and RyhB at 37C (A and B, respectively). Aliquots were withdrawn at the times indicated above each lane,
phenol extracted and analysed on an 8% sequencing gel. The graph on (C) shows the relative amount of sodB192 mRNA remaining at each time point of (A) as
determined by phosphorimaging and plotted as a function of time. (D) Mapping of the RNase E cleavage sites within the sodB 50-UTR in the presence (+) or absence

concomitantly run S1 and T1 digests of the same RNA.

of RyhB. We additionally found that the rates of RyhB decay in
the wild-type E.coli strain and in an rnets mutant are indistin-
guishable at non-permissive temperature (Figure 6A), suggest-
ing that the above increase in the steady-state level of RyhB (42)
does not stem from RyhB stabilization, but instead may be a
consequence of transcriptional regulation. For example, the
elevated level of RyhB could be, al least in part, brought
about by a higher level of Hfq in the rnets mutant (see
Figure 6C), which is known to decrease the intracellular con-
centration of Fur (17), thereby facilitating RyhB transcription.

and the resulting mixtures were then analysed on a 6% native gel. The positions

amounts (1-, 2-, 4- and 8-fold molar excess) of competitor RNAs (sodB192 and
sodB151, respectively). Translation inhibition complex formation was further
analysed by primer extension as described in Materials and Methods. (C)

presence (lane 7) of 1-fold molar excess of sodB192 RNA. Lanes 8–10 corres-

acrylamide gel as described in Materials and Methods. Single and double circles
indicate the RyhB–sodB192 and RyhB–Hfq–sodB192 complexes, respectively.

Given that RyhB is apparently targeted for degradation via
an RNase E-independent pathway, we also investigated
whether the absence of functional RNase III, a double-
strand specific E.coli endoribonuclease [reviewed in (43)],
affects the stability of RyhB in vivo. Figure 6B shows that
the decay rate of RyhB was slightly decreased in an RNase III-
deficient strain, indicating that although the main fraction of
this transcript still remained unaffected, yet some portion of it
seems to be cleaved by this endoribonuclease in vivo. While
testing this idea further, we found that RyhB degradative inter-
mediates can be easily detected in vivo when E.coli cell cul-
tures are treated with 2,20-dipyridyl (Figure 6D). Moreover,
their accumulation is not affected by inactivation of RNase E
(Figure 6E) but is impaired in an RNase III-deficient strain
(Figure 6E). Collectively, these data suggest that RyhB
degradation in vivo involves its cleavage by RNase III.
RNase III cleavage of RyhB is facilitated by
base pairing with its mRNA target
Our in vivo data (Figure 6) and the reported interdependence of
RyhB and sodB mRNA decay (42) suggest that a 9 bp region,
which is formed upon RyhB-sodB 50-UTR base pairing (see
Figure 7B) (28), together with other double-stranded RNA
structures of RyhB can be potentially used by RNase III to
bind to the RyhB–sodB 50-UTR complex and to cleave RyhB,
thereby targeting it for degradation. To test whether RNase III
cleavage of RyhB can be detected in vitro, we incubated 50
end-labelled RyhB with RNase III in the presence of Hfq and
increasing quantities of sodB192 RNA. As shown in Figure 7A,
RyhB alone is relatively resistant to RNase III cleavage (lanes
3–5). In contrast, an increase in the concentration of sodB192
facilitates RNase III cleavage of RyhB at U46 and at some
minor sites (Figure 7A). Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro
data (Figures 6 and 7, respectively) strongly suggest that the
second major E.coli endoribonuclease RNase III is involved in
RyhB turnover and, therefore, plays an indirect role in RyhB-
mediated decay of the sodB transcript.
CONCLUSIONS
It is generally believed that the majority of E.coli mRNAs are
targeted for degradation following initial endonucleolytic
cleavages, which often occur within their 50-UTR (4). In agree-
ment with this model, we demonstrated that decay of sodB
mRNA is retarded upon inactivation of RNase E in vivo
(Figure 2) and RNase E cleaves within the 50-UTR of this
transcript in vitro (Figure 3). As depicted in Figure 8 (left
panel), by eliminating the 50-end stem–loop structure of the
transcript containing the 50-triphosphate group of the sodB
transcript, the initial cleavage(s) should render 50-
monophosphorylated intermediate products. As RNA sub-
strates bearing 50-monophosphate groups are known to be
better substrate than triphosphorylated ones for E.coli
RNase E (44,45) and poly(A) polymerase I (46), the initial
cleavage can apparently facilitate the action of these enzymes
at subsequent steps of mRNA turnover. In addition to the
above role, RNase E cleavage at position U21 reduces the
affinity of the sodB translation initiation region for ribosomes.
Given that a decrease of ribosome loading onto a transcript is
known to destabilize the entire mRNA (18,47–49) resulting in
its complete decay, our data suggest that functional and chem-
ical inactivation of the sodB mRNA are interdependent and are
both initiated by RNase E cleavage.
Besides general mechanisms controlling mRNA decay in
bacteria, the stability of many transcripts is regulated by envir-
onmental factors, such as temperature (50–52), pH (53) and
the availability of various chemicals important for bacterial
growth and survival (54). Previous work has shown that,
during adjustments of E.coli to decreasing concentrations of
iron, the level of sodB mRNA is decreased (55). This regu-
lation involves translational inhibition of sodB mRNA by
RyhB (17,23,42). We observed that sodB/RyhB base pairing
Figure 7. RNase III cleavage of RyhB is stimulated by base pairing with its
mRNA target. (A) Radioactively labelled RyhB pre-incubated with a 6-fold
molar excess of Hfq was further incubated with RNase III in the absence (lanes
1–5) or presence of increasing quantities of sodB192 RNA (5-, 20- and 40-fold
molar excess; lanes 6–14, respectively), and aliquots withdrawn at times
indicated above each lane were analysed on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide
sequencing-type gel. The major nucleotide (U46) at which RNase III cleaves
RyhB RNA was determined from concomitantly run S1 and T1 digests of the
same RNA (data not shown). (B) Model for sodB mRNA–RyhB interaction
adopted from Geissmann and Touati (28). The major RNase III site of RyhB
[see (A)] and RNase E cleavage sites within the 50-leader of the sodB transcript
(this study) are shown.

promotes RNase E cleavage at position A+12, i.e. in the imme-
diate coding region of the sodB transcript (Figure 8, right
panel). This cleavage most likely results from structural
rearrangements in the 50-UTR of sodB mRNA upon interaction
with Hfq and RyhB. Moreover, although after base pairing of
these RNAs Hfq remained associated with the RyhB–sodB
mRNA complex, it could be released from it through interac-
tion with other ligands. Thus, titration of Hfq by other ligands
could free the RNA chaperone from ‘death end’ complexes.
Finally, although E.coli RNase E is often considered as the
major enzyme controlling the metabolic stability of mRNA
and regulatory RNAs [i.e. RNAI (8)], we showed here that the
degradation of RyhB and perhaps that of other sRNAs is not
always affected by this enzyme in vivo but is dependent on
RNase III (Figure 6) known to be involved in rRNA processing
and stability control of certain mRNAs (56). Moreover, RNase
III cleavage of RyhB was also observed in vitro under
conditions facilitating RyhB–sodB 50-UTR base pairing,
thus suggesting a role for RNase III in the coupled degradation
of these transcripts in vivo. These data together with another
example of post-transcriptional control mediated by the small
regulatory RNA IstR (57), which is cleaved by RNase III upon
Figure 8. Model for sodB mRNA decay at high and low iron concentrations. The pathway for sodB mRNA decay in the presence of steady-state levels of iron is shown
on the left. The RNase E cleavage eliminates the 50 terminal stem–loop structure and triggers both chemical and functional inactivation of the transcript. Owing to
lower affinity for 30S ribosomal subunits, translation of the truncated sodB mRNA is less efficient, thereby allowing RNase E cleavage at downstream site(s). The
latter results in the subsequent loss of ribosomal subunits and degradation of the intermediate ribosome-free RNA fragments by endo- and exonucleases. The iron-
dependent inactivation of the sodB transcript, which is initiated by the small regulatory RNA RyhB and Hfq, is shown on the right. The base pairing with RyhB, which
is known to cause structural rearrangements within the sodB 50-UTR (28), inhibits translation and induces RNase E cleavage at the downstream site A+12, whereas the
coordinated decay of RyhB is initiated by RNase III cleavage at U46 (for details, see Figure 7). Similar to the general pathway, the degradation of the intermediate
products is accomplished by exo- and endoribonucleases.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5 1687
its base pairing with mRNA, suggest that E.coli RNase III may
play a much more significant role in bacterial gene regulation.
