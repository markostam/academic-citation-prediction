Hydroacoustic Estimates of Fish Abundance in Lake Superior 427
INTRODUCTION
Lake herring Coregonus artedi and rainbow
smelt Osmerus mordax are an important resource
for the recovering lake trout Salvelinus namaycush
populations and also support a valuable commercial
fishery in Lake Superior. Thus, lake trout and the
commercial fishery represent a demand on the prey
fish resource. A commonly used technique to deter-
mine if sufficient resources exist to support demand
is demand-supply (D-S) analysis (Stewart et al.
1983, Ney 1990, Ney 1993, Stewart and Ibarra
1991, Rand and Stewart 1998, Baldwin et al. 2000,
Johnson and Martinez 2000). D-S analysis com-
bines estimates of prey abundance with predator
consumption estimates from bioenergetics models
to evaluate carrying capacity limitations (Ney
1990). Two relatively recent D-S analyses have
suggested that demand by salmonine predators in
Lake Superior exceeded prey supply (Negus 1995,
Ebener 1995). Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
tshawytscha) hatchery returns and harvest have de-
clined steadily since the mid 1980s (Schreiner
1995, Bronte et al. 2003) suggesting a decrease in
lake survival, which supports the imbalance sug-
gested by the demand-supply analysis (Negus
1995). Moreover, salmonine growth rates and size
at age have also declined (Johnson et al. 2001, M.T.
Negus, Minnesota Department of Natural Re-
sources, personal communication). Despite these
apparent declines, Lake Superior now supports nat-
ural production of lake trout to the point where
stocking was drastically reduced (Hansen et al.
1995) and wild populations have reached or ex-
ceeded historical levels in some locations (Wilberg
et al. 2003). The success of lake trout restoration in
Lake Superior contradicts the D-S discrepancy. The
combination of the above evidence is thus inconclu-
sive and suggests that a re-evaluation of the data
used for the bioenergetics D-S analysis is necessary.
Required data for the bioenergetics D-S analysis
includes predator mortality estimates, predator diet
information, predator and prey energy content, and
estimates of prey and predator fish biomass. State,
tribal, and federal agencies have committed to in-
creased sampling of salmonines for diet information
in U.S. waters of Lake Superior and to increased ef-
forts to estimate predator abundance, and we have
sufficient information on predator and prey energy
densities (Johnson et al. 1998, Johnson et al. 1999).
Further understanding of dietary linkages has been

ABSTRACT. Lake herring (Coregonus artedi) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) are a valuable prey
resource for the recovering lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Superior. However, prey biomass
may be insufficient to support the current predator demand. In August 1997, we assessed the abundance
and spatial distribution of pelagic coregonines and rainbow smelt in western Lake Superior by combining
a 120 kHz split beam acoustics system with midwater trawls. Coregonines comprised the majority of 
the midwater trawl catches and the length distributions for trawl caught fish coincided with estimated
sizes of acoustic targets. Overall mean pelagic prey fish biomass was 15.56 kg ha–1 with the greatest fish
biomass occurring in the Apostle Islands region (27.98 kg ha–1), followed by the Duluth Minnesota
region (20.22 kg ha–1), and with the lowest biomass occurring in the open waters of western Lake Supe-
rior (9.46 kg ha–1). Biomass estimates from hydroacoustics were typically 2–134 times greater than esti-
mates derived from spring bottom trawl surveys. Prey fish biomass for Lake Superior is about order of
magnitude less than acoustic estimates for Lakes Michigan and Ontario. Discrepancies observed between
bioenergetics-based estimates of predator consumption of coregonines and earlier coregonine biomass
estimates may be accounted for by our hydroacoustic estimates.

gained through stable isotope analysis of key fish
species (Harvey et al. 2002, Harvey et al. 2003).
However, accurate biomass estimates of the pelagic
prey fish are still lacking. Thus, quantitative esti-
mates of pelagic prey fish biomass are key to un-
derstanding the capacity of Lake Superior to
support current and future populations of wild, nat-
uralized, and hatchery produced predators.
The dominant salmonine predators in Lake Supe-
rior are the lean lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush
namaycush) and siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus na-
maycush siscowet), while chinook salmon, coho
salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (On-
corhynchus mykiss), and brown trout (Salmo trutta)
are also present but are far less abundant (Bronte et
al. 2003). The primary prey items of the salmonine
predators are lake herring and rainbow smelt (Dryer
et al. 1965, Anderson and Smith 1971, Conner et
al. 1993, Negus 1995, Ebener 1995). Currently, the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) conducts
population assessments of lake herring and rainbow
smelt from spring bottom trawl surveys. These rou-
tine assessments provide a valuable “index of abun-
dance” for a variety of pelagic and benthic fishes
and information on trends, mortality, and size at
age, but may not provide accurate estimates of ab-
solute abundance for pelagic species. The lack of
quantitative biomass estimates of prey fish can im-
pede prudent management (e.g., stocking and catch
limit decisions) for Lake Superior, and our under-
standing of predator prey interactions.
Hydroacoustic surveys offer an alternative
method to bottom trawl surveys for determining
pelagic fish abundance, and when properly cali-
brated, hydroacoustics can provide estimates of ab-
solute abundance. Hydroacoustics has been
effectively used in Lakes Michigan (Brandt 1980,
Brandt et al. 1991, Argyle 1992), Ontario (Mason
et al. 2001), and Superior (Heist and Swenson
1983) and is an established assessment tool used
throughout the world (Thorne 1983, Baily and Sim-
monds 1990). Our objectives were to estimate
pelagic fish biomass and spatial distribution using
hydroacoustics, and to compare hydroacoustic esti-
mates of pelagic fish abundance to estimates from
bottom trawl surveys. Any inconsistencies in the
biomass estimates of pelagic fish may explain the
D-S discrepancy. To address these objectives, we
used spatial data comprised of concurrent hydroa-
coustic and mid-water trawl information collected
in 1997, as well as information from the bottom
trawl surveys in the same year, to identify the level
of agreement between the two methods and to esti-
mate the biomass of prey fishes for comparison to
predator demand. Also, we compared hydroacoustic
results from surveys conducted during the day and
at night and offer recommendations for future sur-
veys.
METHODS
General Sampling Design
Nighttime hydroacoustic and midwater trawl sur-
veys of pelagic fishes were conducted in western
Lake Superior during 13–22 August 1997 along
transects that spanned three distinctive regions-
Apostle Islands (complex bathymetry), open lake
(deep, cold), and a region directly influenced by
Duluth, MN and the influx of the St. Louis River
(Fig. 1). The survey employed vessels working in
tandem: one that deployed hydroacoustic equipment
and another that followed with the mid-water trawl
gear. Hydroacoustic sampling was accomplished
from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Re-
sources R/V Hack Noyes (13–14 August) and the
United States Environmental Protection Agency
vessel R/V Lake Explorer (15–22 August). Midwa-
ter trawl tows from the USGS R/V Siscowet were
used to identify acoustic echoes to species and to
compare fish size with acoustic estimates of fish
size. We also collected water quality, zooplankton,
and forage fish diet information (see Johnson et al.
2004). Sampling was done primarily at night; how-
ever we collected some daytime acoustics in the
Apostle Islands to compare to night estimates of
biomass.
Acoustic Sampling
We used a 120 kHz split-beam (15°) digital
echosounder (HTI model 241) to measure the spa-
tial distribution, density, and size of pelagic fishes
during day and night with 200.8 dB Source Level
(re µPa @ 1m), –154.3 dB 40LogR system gain (dB
re V µPa @ 1m), –133.4 dB 20LogR system gain
(dB re V µPa @ 1m), pulse width of 0.4 ms and at
two pings per second. The acoustic transducer was
mounted on a 2.5-m aluminum towbody and towed
alongside the research vessel at a depth of about 
1 m from the surface at speeds of 2.5–3.5 m s–1.
Equipment performance was monitored in the field
using an oscilloscope. Signals were digitized and
recorded on digital audiotapes for later post-pro-
cessing and analyses in the laboratory. Routine cali-
bration was performed using a tungsten carbide
reference sphere (Foote et al. 1987, Foote 1990).
Hydroacoustic Estimates of Fish Abundance in Lake Superior 429
Acoustic data were processed using a threshold
value of –60 dB for both the echo-squared integra-
tion and split-beam analyses. Echo-squared integra-
tion provides a relative measure of fish density that
can be scaled to absolute fish density with system
parameters obtained from equipment calibration
and measures of the mean backscattering cross-
section of the fish obtained from split-beam analy-
ses (MacLennan and Simmonds 1992). Prior to pro-
cessing, raw acoustic data were carefully inspected
for noise and bottom intrusion; such were removed
prior to processing. Acoustic signals were vertically
binned beginning 2-m below the transducer
(approximately 3-m below the surface) to 100 m at
1-m intervals and horizontally binned in intervals of
120 s, corresponding to a horizontal resolution of
about 300–420 m. Sums of squared voltages were
inspected for noise and bottom contamination be-
fore scaling to absolute estimates of abundance.
Split-beam analysis was used to determine the
depth distribution of fish backscattering cross-
section (σbs) and fish target strengths (TS, with
TS=LOG10 σbs), i.e., fish acoustic size. Acoustic
size is the fraction of incident sound energy that is
reflected by a fish back toward the transducer and is
related to size of the fish. Target strength values
were converted to estimates of fish length and mass
using an empirical relationship developed by Fleis-
cher et al. (1997) for Great Lakes coregonine
fishes:

430 Mason et al.
Log10 W = 4.326 + 0.066 TS
Log10 L = 2.023 + 0.019 TS
where W is mass (g) and L is length (cm). 
Fish biomass density (g m–2) was determined by
dividing the sums of squared voltages by the mean
backscattering cross section (σ µbs) and multiplying
by the average mass (from TS-mass relationship) of
an individual fish for each 1 m × 120 s cell. Mean
backscattering cross-section (σ µbs) was calculated
for each 1 m vertical and 120 s horizontal distance,
using only targets with multiple returns (two or
more returns from a single target), to convert echo-
squared integration into measures of fish density.
When there were insufficient numbers of individual
acoustic targets to estimate σ µbs within a cell, the
mean σ µbs of horizontal neighboring cells were used.
Cells were then summed vertically for each 120 sec
segment and converted to kg ha–1.
Biological Sampling
We used midwater trawls (N = 19 tows) to relate
species identities and fish sizes to acoustic targets.
The midwater trawl (14-m box design, 6-mm cod
end mesh) was towed at about 4.8 km hr–1 for 45
min, filtering about 4,070 m3 min–1 trawled. Mid-
water trawls were fished at discrete depths (head-
rope depth: 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, or 50 m), and
positions monitored using SCANMAR trawl men-
suration gear. All fish captured were identified,
counted, measured (± 1 mm), and weighed (± 1 g).
Abundance Estimates
We estimated pelagic fish biomass density (kg
ha–1) for the entire western basin and for each re-
gion (Fig. 1). To do this, we bootstrapped the non-
transformed data (each 300–420 m segment) within
and amongst regions 1,000 times using Splus® (In-
sightful Corp 2001) to estimate arithmetic mean
and precision of biomass density. 
In addition, we log10 transformed the data and
used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to de-
termine the bathymetric depth-dependent biomass
distribution of Lake Superior fishes. GAMs have
additive terms like linear (regression) models, but
the terms are obtained using nonparameteric scat-
terplot smoothers (here smoothing splines), which
allow the data to suggest nonlinearities (Hastie
1992). Bathymetric depth and location, represented
as a two-way interaction term between latitude and
longitude, were used as predictors of fish biomass
density. An iterative model search was conducted to
identify the optimum smoothing parameter from a
rich set of potential values for each of the additive
terms, based on the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC; Akaike 1973). All GAMs reported here were
fitted using Splus 6.0 (Insightful Corp 2001). 
RESULTS
Target Strength vs. Trawl Catch
Mean fish length was similar between TS- and
midwater trawl-derived estimates (mean = 21.1 cm,
Fig. 2). However, TS-derived estimates of fish
length failed to capture the tri-modal length fre-
quency distribution observed in the trawl catches. A
comparison of mean mass between TS- and midwa-
ter trawl-derived estimates was less favorable (TS
FIG. 2. Comparison of trawl and hydroacoustic
size estimates (i.e., target strength, TS). Lengths
and mass of fish collected from trawls where con-
verted to TS (dB), and TS values where converted
from TS to length and mass units, using the equa-
tions found in Fleischer et al. (1997) for Lake
Michigan fishes.

mean = 86.2 g, trawl mean = 75.3 g). Estimates of
TS-derived mass failed to capture the modality of
the field data, however the range in the data was
similar.
Species Composition
We collected 137 fish representing five species—
lake herring (N = 58), rainbow smelt (N = 45),
bloater Coregonus hoyi (N = 18), kiyi Coregonus
kiyi (N = 12), and lake trout (N = 1) with three
unidentified coregonines. Due to the low catch rates
we were unable to collect a sufficient number of
fish in each region to construct realistic species
compositions. For example, bloaters were absent
from our midwater trawl tows in the Duluth and
open water regions, despite their known occurrence
in these regions. However, we did have relatively
high catch rates in the Apostle Islands (total N =
55; bloaters N = 18)). From midwater trawls in the
Apostle Islands, we discerned two nearly disjoint
size classes representing two different groups of
fish—coregonines and rainbow smelt (Fig. 3). We
divided the two size groups at –40 dB, approxi-
mately 18.3 cm and 48.5 g (Fig. 3), and assigned
the larger targets as coregonines (lake herring,
bloater, kiyi) and the smaller fish as rainbow smelt.
We then used this size criterion to estimate group
composition and group specific biomass for all re-
gions. Lack of significant recruitment of corego-
nines (few small individuals) and a size distribution
skewed towards larger individuals (Bronte et al.
2003), supports our classification based on size
threshold. For the Apostle Islands, our acoustical
estimates of species composition on a mass basis
were similar to that observed with the midwater
trawl catches (Table 1). Our hydroacoustically de-
rived species composition by biomass differed from
species composition estimated from June bottom
trawls (Table 2). For the Duluth-Superior region,
hydroacoustic estimates of species composition
tended to have lower percentage of rainbow smelt
but higher percentage of coregonines when com-
pared to the spring bottom trawl survey. However,
hydroacoustics estimated a greater percentage of
rainbow smelt and a lower percentage of corego-
nines in the open lake and Apostle Islands region.
Spatial Distribution
Distinct diel vertical migration of fishes occurred
in the Apostle Islands region (Fig. 4). During the
day, peak concentrations of fish biomass (from hy-
droacoustics) occurred near the bottom in shallower
areas, with lower concentration of fish found over
deeper water. At night, fish dispersed and migrated
toward the surface. Daylight estimate of arithmetic
mean fish biomass density was 20.80 kg ha–1,

(1997) for Lake Michigan fishes. Vertical dotted

which was 78% of the estimated night fish biomass
density. 
Fish biomass density also varied with respect to
bathymetric depth (Fig. 5). Maximum fish biomass
density peaked between the bathymetric depth con-
tours of about 55–100 m. For the Duluth and the
Apostle Islands regions, peak in biomass density
was spread out across these depths. For the open
lake region, peak biomass density occurred between
about 75–100 m bathymetric depths. Biomass den-
sity across all regions dropped rapidly as bathymet-
ric depths approached 100 m. As a result of this
observation, we also estimated fish biomass for ba-
thymetric depths less than and greater than 100 m.
Biomass Estimates
Biomass differed among regions (Table 3) with
highest biomass measured in the Apostle Islands
(27.98 kg ha–1), followed by Duluth-Superior
(20.22 kg ha–1), and then the open lake region (9.46
kg ha–1). Highest biomass occurred within the 
100-m bathymetric contour where biomass was
4–24 times greater than offshore waters (Table 3).
On a group-specific basis, coregonine overall bio-
mass density was highest in the Apostle Islands
(24.37 kg ha–1) and lowest in the open lake region
(7.86 kg ha–1) (Fig. 6). For rainbow smelt, greatest
overall biomass density occurred in the Apostle Is-
lands (3.61 kg ha–1) and was lowest in the open
lake region (1.60 kg ha–1) (Fig. 6).
Comparison with 
Traditional Bottom Trawl Assessment
The principal motivation for this study was to
identify whether discrepancies between prey fish
abundance and predator demand could be explained
by bias in prey fish biomass estimated using the
area-swept method from bottom trawls. The dis-
crepancy between demand and supply identified by
Negus (1995) used USGS bottom trawl data. We
compared hydroacoustics estimates of fish biomass
to estimates from the USGS trawl surveys. USGS
bottom trawl surveys use the area-swept method
and integrate across the bathymetric depths 15 to
about 75 m with a maximum depth of 100 m. Sam-
pling is conducted during the daylight hours when
fish are typically associated with the bottom. The
range in trawling depths is consistent with our ob-
servations that much of the fish biomass is inshore
of the 100-m bathymetric contour (Table 3, Fig. 5). 
Our hydroacoustic estimates of mean total fish
biomass inshore of the 100-m bathymetric contour
were consistently higher than the bottom trawl esti-
mates from June of the same year (Fig. 7). Hydroa-
coustics estimates of mean biomass were on
average greater by a factor of about fifty, but the
magnitude of the difference was dependent upon re-
gion. By regions, hydroacoustics estimates were
2.0, 14.4, and 134.1 times higher for Apostle Is-
lands, Duluth-Superior, and open lake regions, re-
spectively (Fig. 7). Our estimates of coregonine
biomass were 1.8, 21.1, and 1,141.0 times higher
than for bottom trawl estimates for the Apostle Is-
lands, Duluth, and open lake regions, respectively
(Fig. 8). For rainbow smelt, acoustic biomass esti-
mates were 7.7, 4.2, and 25.1 times that of the trawl
estimates for Apostle Islands, Duluth, and open
lake regions, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Evaluation of the D-S Paradox
Negus (1995) suggested that the demand-supply
discrepency for the Minnesota waters of Lake Su-
perior may partly be due to the biases associated
with using bottom trawls to estimate pelagic prey
fish biomass. The discrepancy was substantial and
indicated that lake trout eat about 21.4 times more
rainbow smelt and 7.6 times more coregonines than
were available, as estimated from the trawl surveys.
Our hydroacoustic estimates of rainbow smelt
abundance were greater than estimates from bottom
trawls by a factor of 4.1 in the Duluth-Superior re-
gion and a factor of 25.0 in the open lake region
(Fig. 8), suggesting that there may be about 17.3
times (weighted for area less than 100-m bathymet-
ric contour) more biomass of rainbow smelt than
estimated from the bottom trawls. The biomass esti-
mates of coregonines from hydroacoustics were

greater than bottom trawl estimates by a factor of
21.1 to 1,141 (Fig. 8). The magnitude of the differ-
ence in the biomass estimates between our 1997 hy-
droacoustics and 1997 USGS bottom trawls for
rainbow smelt does not appear sufficient to account
for the differences between demand and prey bio-
mass. However, estimates of coregonine biomass
using hydroacoustics suggest that there are suffi-
cient coregonine prey resources to support predator
and fishery demand. Differences in biomass esti-
mates of coregonines between the two approaches
may be attributable to diel vertical migration that
takes fish deeper than 100 m during daylight hours.
A second D-S exercise expanded the spatial cov-
erage of the analysis to include the entire western
basin of Lake Superior (Ebener 1995). Ebener
(1995) found that there should be 1.25 times more
rainbow smelt than estimated by bottom trawls and
that there was sufficient coregonine biomass. Our
hydroacoustic estimates of rainbow smelt biomass,
when averaged over the three stratified regions in-
shore of the 100-m bathymetric contour, was about
11 times greater than that estimated with bottom
trawls. If differences between acoustics and trawl
estimates were consistent between years, it would
appear that there were sufficient rainbow smelt re-
sources to balance estimated predator consumption
and observed fish removals.

Hydroacoustic Estimates of Fish Abundance in Lake Superior 435
may be accounted for by using hydroacoustics for
biomass estimates. While the D-S paradox for rain-
bow smelt biomass estimates is not yet totally re-
solved, hydroacoustics appears to hold promise.
Rainbow smelt biomass derived from hydroa-
coustics surveys over larger spatial regions esti-
mated sufficient rainbow smelt resources, while
estimates on a small spatial region still provide in-
conclusive results. Such contrasting results across
spatial scale may suggest that salmonine growth
and foraging is not confined to the Minnesota wa-
ters of Lake Superior (Negus 1995), but rather oc-
curs over a much larger spatial arena. For example,
pacific salmonines in the Great Lakes show little
site affinity during the year (Keller et al. 1990,
Peck et al. 1999) making population estimates and
spatial estimates of consumption difficult. Alterna-
tively, pelagic prey fishes may undergo seasonal
lake wide movements, periodically enhancing local
prey abundance sufficient to support predator de-
mand. Such seasonal patterns in prey fish spatial
distributions have been observed for rainbow smelt
and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in Lake Michi-
gan (Brandt et al. 1991) and may contribute to the
discrepancies observed in western Lake Superior.
Potential Biases in the D-S Analysis
While there are clear mechanisms for possible
bias in bottom trawl surveys, there are also possible
sources of errors in estimates produced using hy-
droacoustic analyses, such as the inclusion of noise,
scattering from plankton, and second echoes or bot-
tom intrusions. We have attempted to minimize
these errors by careful post processing of the data.
In addition, the selection of target strength-length
equations used also represents a possible source of
error in computing biomass estimates. We selected
the equations established by Fleischer et al. (1997).
These relationships were established for species en-
countered that corresponded in size to those col-
lected in our trawl samples. These equations tend to
overestimate length of small targets and underesti-
mate lengths of large targets (Rudstam et al. 2003).
We recommend using alternative equations if the
size range of fish being sampled falls outside the
size range used to develop the relationship. For ex-
ample, in years with a strong lake herring year class
(i.e., many small fish), the Fleisher et al. equation
may bias the results and lead to estimates that
greatly exceed the actual biomass of fish in the sur-
vey area. Conversely, if large coregonids dominate
the composition, the biomass estimated using the
Fleischer equation will underestimate the biomass
density of prey species.

Comparison with the Other
Laurentian Great Lakes
Hydroacoustic estimates of pelagic fish biomass
density (area-weighted arithmetic estimates) in
western Lake Superior are roughly an order of mag-
nitude less than similar estimates of fish biomass
from Lakes Michigan and Ontario. In Lake Michi-
gan, Brandt et al. (1991) estimated pelagic fish bio-
mass in late summer of 1987 to be 93.90 kg ha–1.
Similarly, Argyle et al. (1998) estimated pelagic
fish biomass to range from 59.00–260.80 kg ha–1
(mean: 135.70 kg ha–1) during early fall for the
years 1991–96. For Lake Ontario, average lake-
wide biomass density of pelagic fishes was 191.00
kg ha–1 in 1990 (Mason et al. 2001). The difference
in pelagic fish biomass between Lake Superior and
the other Great Lakes in not unexpected as Lake
Superior is the coldest and most oligotrophic of all
the Great Lakes.
Our results represent a significant first step for
quantifying pelagic prey fish biomass using hydroa-
coustics, and for understanding the demand-supply
relationships in Lake Superior. Comparison of day
vs. night sampling indicates that night sampling of-
fers the most effective means of estimating fish
density. However, the equipment employed re-
stricted meaningful analyses of fish targets to water
column depths shallower than 100 m, and we had
limited effort in the open lake region. It is possible
that fish migrate below 100 m depth during the day
and the presence of a vertical migration may offer a
mechanism explaining the observed discrepancy.
Increased efforts to quantify prey fish biomass in
deeper areas and in the open water regions of the
lake may provide insight into the existence of addi-
tional forage utilized by predators. Moreover, a
more rigorous midwater trawling regime is neces-
sary to determine fish species composition for cal-
culating species-specific biomass estimates from
acoustics, and for further testing the TS-length (and
mass) relationship used here. Lastly, the compari-
son of hydroacoustics estimates of biomass to bot-
tom trawl estimates should be continued to develop
statistical models that may allow corrections to be
applied to bottom trawl data for more accurate esti-
mates of bottom trawl determined biomass. Bottom
trawl surveys, while underestimating pelagic core-
gonine abundance, still are the only source for bio-
mass and trend data for a variety of fishes (e.g.,
sculpins),  which also serve as forage for
salmonines, and are generally undetected by hy-
droacoustics.
There appears to be significantly more pelagic
prey fish in Lake Superior than previously thought,
and this will have a large impact on our understand-
ing of predator-prey dynamics in the lake. How-
ever, Lake Superior appears to support a much
lower pelagic prey fish biomass than the other
Great Lakes. Our results suggest that there may be
sufficient prey resources to support the current
predator population. Further study into the spatial
variability in prey distribution will continue to pro-
vide needed insight into demand-supply debate in
Lake Superior.
