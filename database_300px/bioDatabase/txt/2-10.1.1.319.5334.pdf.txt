Abstract The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a bile acid-
activated transcription factor that regulates the expression
of genes critical for bile acid and lipid homeostasis. This
study was undertaken to investigate the pathological conse-
quences of the loss of FXR function on the risk and severity
of atherosclerosis. For this purpose, FXR-deficient (

Dyslipidemia, characterized by low levels of HDL and
high levels of LDL, is a known risk factor for the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis. An important early event in this
disease process is the deposition of lipid-filled plaques in
the walls of arteries. Plaque formation is initiated when ar-
terial wall macrophages accumulate modified LDL and
initiate a chronic inflammatory state. Over time, this in-
flammatory state can lead to thickening of the arterial
wall, fibrosis, and eventually rupture of the plaque, throm-
 
bosis, and occlusion of normal blood flow (1). The cur-
rent regimen of pharmacological therapies for the
treatment of cardiovascular disease remains incomplete,
despite the fact that cardiovascular disease (characterized
by atherosclerosis) remains the leading cause of death in
Western societies (2, 3). Nuclear receptors are ligand-acti-
vated transcription factors that regulate many physiologi-
cal and developmental processes, such as reproduction,
metabolism, and cellular differentiation. This function is
achieved by modulating the expression of target genes
through binding to specific response elements in the pro-
moter regions of these genes, leading to the recruitment
of coactivators or corepressors that induce or repress the
target gene, respectively (4). A number of nuclear recep-
tors, including the liver X receptors and peroxisome pro-
liferator-activated receptors, have important regulatory
roles in lipid homeostasis (5–8). Consequently, a great
deal of research has been devoted to the selective modula-
tion of these receptors as a novel therapeutic approach to
the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis (9–11).
Excess cholesterol is transported from peripheral tis-
sues to the liver by HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol
transport (RCT). Once in the liver, cholesterol can be se-
creted into the bile either directly or after conversion to
bile acids. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear re-
ceptor that is activated by binding to bile acids and func-
tions primarily as a bile acid sensor in the liver to induce
and repress genes involved in bile acid export (bile salt ex-
port pump) and synthesis (cytochrome P450 7A1), respec-
tively (12, 13). This conversion of cholesterol to bile acids
and subsequent efflux to the bile is a quantitatively impor-
tant contributor to RCT and by extension is also impor-
tant for the prevention of atherosclerosis. Beyond this
function, accumulating evidence strongly supports an ex-
panded role for FXR in the regulation of systemic lipid

homeostasis. For example, FXR activates the expression of
the genes encoding apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) and the
LDL receptor (14, 15) and represses the expression of the
genes encoding apoA-I and apoC-III as well as hepatic li-
pase (16, 17). More recently, FXR has also been linked
to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism (18–20).
Together, these data indicate a broad regulatory role for
FXR in systemic energy metabolism.
Given that FXR activation is linked to the repression of
hepatic bile acid synthesis, agonists of this receptor would
be expected to impair RCT and hepatic cholesterol elimi-
nation. Consistent with this, treatment of wild-type but not

been reported to decrease hepatic cholesterol (21, 22).
Paradoxically,

 mice exhibit increased blood tri-
glyceride and cholesterol levels as well as increased accu-
mulation of lipids in the liver, despite increased secretion
of both bile acids and cholesterol (23, 24). Furthermore,
FXR agonists have been shown to produce a potentially
beneficial reduction of blood triglyceride in rodents (14,
17, 25). This study was undertaken to examine and clarify
the pathological consequences of the loss of FXR function
on lipid homeostasis and atherosclerotic progression. The
results of this study indicate that targeted disruption of
the FXR gene leads to more severe atherosclerosis in an
established murine model of this disease and provide the
first direct evidence linking this receptor to the risk and
severity of cardiovascular disease.

 mice. The back-
ground of all mice used in this study was C57BL/6J. Seven- to
8-week-old male mice were placed on either chow (7% fat) (F4516;
based on the AIN-93G diet) or a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HF/HC)
diet containing 16% fat and 1.25% cholesterol (F4515; Bioserv,
Frenchtown, NJ) for 12 weeks. Animals were weighed once per
week, and food consumption was monitored throughout the
study. All animals were housed at room temperature on a 12 h
light/dark cycle and provided food and water ad libitum. All pro-
cedures were conducted at the Carleton Animal Care Facility in
accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.
 
Plasma analyses
 
Blood was collected using heparinized needles after a 6 h fast
and centrifuged at 6,700 
 
g
 
 for 5 min. Plasma was stored at

C.
Triglyceride and cholesterol levels were measured at 510 and 500
nm, respectively, using in vitro diagnostic reagents and calibra-
tors (Thermo DMA, Arlington, TX) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values were
measured after dilution of the plasma 1:5 with distilled water and
using an Infinity AST Reagent kit (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis,
MO). Values were determined kinetically by the change in absor-
bance at 340 nm and at a temperature of 37

C. All absorbance
measurements were performed using a 96-well plate reader (Pow-
erWaveX; Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Blood glucose
was measured using a personal glucose monitoring device
(TheraSense FreeStyle; AR-Med, Ltd.).
 
Fast-performance liquid chromatography and Western 
blot analysis
 
Fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation
of plasma lipoproteins from pooled plasma samples (200 
 

 
l; n 
 

 
3–5) and analysis of lipid content of the subsequent fractions
were performed as described previously (26). Immunoblot analy-
ses of apoB-100, apoB-48, apoA-I, and apoA-II in the VLDL, LDL,
and HDL fractions (eluting at 14, 20, and 29 ml, respectively)
were performed as described previously (24).
 
Liver lipid measurement
 
Lipids were extracted from liver tissue based on published
methods (27). Solvents were evaporated from the extracted lip-
ids under nitrogen and dissolved in Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), warmed to 37
 

 
C, and mixed with water (1:4).
The samples were then analyzed for triglyceride and cholesterol
content using the same reagents (1

Histology
 
After 12 weeks on the diets, the largest lobe of the liver and
the top half of the heart were obtained from the mice and em-
bedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc., Torrance, CA) com-
bined with sucrose (20%) and stored at 
 



 
C. Ten micrometer
cryosections were obtained lengthwise through the liver lobe
and 5 
 

 
m cryosections were obtained in cross-section through
the aorta at the origin in the heart. All cryosections were fixed
for 1 min in formaldehyde solution, stained for 10 min with Oil
Red O (stains lipids red), and counterstained for 1 min with he-
matoxylin (stains nuclei blue) for qualitative observation of lipid
accumulation. Five micrometer thick cross-sections were obtained
from paraffin-embedded liver and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H
 

 
E). En face lipid accumulation was determined by re-
moving the aortas from the mice from the ileal bifurcation to the
origin at the heart. The heart and the aorta were fixed for a min-
imum of 2 days in 5% neutral buffered formalin (EM Industries,
Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) and 0.5
 

 
 phosphate-buffered saline. The
aortas were then cut longitudinally, splayed and pinned in a dish
that was flooded with Sudan IV stain (stains lipids red) for 8 min,
destained in 80% ethanol for 5 min, and photographed. Quanti-
tation of plaques from the ileal bifurcation to the origin (not in-
cluding any branching vessels) was performed using freehand se-
lection of plaques using ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD). The additive area of all the plaques in a
given aorta was calculated as a percentage of the total surface
area of the aorta.
 
Hepatic gene expression
 
Total hepatic RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent according
to the supplier’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quanti-
tative RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously
(28) with the following modifications. Total RNA (2 
 

 
g) was re-
verse-transcribed using Stratascript reverse transcriptase (Strat-
agene, La Jolla, CA) with random hexamers pd(N)

 according to
the supplier’s instructions. The synthesized cDNA was then am-
plified by quantitative PCR using a Stratagene MX3000p ther-
mocycler in a total volume of 25

 animals. Before crossing
with the 
 
ApoE/ mice (pure C57BL/6J background), the
existing FXR/ mouse model (24) was backcrossed 10 gen-
erations to a congenic C57BL/6J background. We then fed
these mice standard rodent chow or the HF/HC diet con-
taining increased levels of fat (16%, w/w) and cholesterol
(1.25%, w/w) for a total of 12 weeks. Cholic acid is com-
monly included in atherogenic diets to increase the di-
etary absorption of lipids and to increase the inflamma-
tory response. Because we have shown previously that
dietary cholic acid is extremely toxic to FXR/ mice (24),
we omitted this component from our atherogenic diet. As
indicators of the general health of mice throughout the
12 week feeding study, starting weights (day 1), cumula-
tive weight gain, food consumption, and survival rates
were monitored. Starting weights were similar in all exper-
imental groups with the exception of FXR/ApoE/ mice
in the chow-fed group, which were of lower starting weight
than ApoE/ mice on the same diet (Table 1). FXR/
ApoE/ mice on a HF/HC diet failed to gain weight to
a similar magnitude as wild-type, ApoE/, and FXR/
mice on the same diet. FXR/ApoE/ mice on the HF/
HC diet gained 2.8-fold less weight than FXR/ and
ApoE/ mice and 3.7-fold less than wild-type mice on the
same diet (Table 1). The reduced weight gain exhibited
by FXR/ApoE/ mice was not attributable to reduced
caloric intake, because the food consumption of this group
did not differ from that of wild-type or FXR/ mice (Ta-
ble 1). ApoE/ mice fed a HF/HC diet had the highest
food consumption, consuming 1.3-fold more than the
other groups on the same diet. Survival rates of the four
genotypes of mice on both chow and the HF/HC diet were
100% with the exception of the FXR/ApoE/ mice on the
HF/HC diet, which exhibited 66.7% survival (Table 1).
FXR/ApoE/ mice have increased blood levels of 
cholesterol, triglyceride, and AST
After 12 weeks on regular chow, blood cholesterol levels
of ApoE/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice were significantly
greater than those of wild-type or FXR/ mice fed the
same diet but did not differ significantly from one an-
other. FXR/ApoE/ mice challenged by a HF/HC diet
had significantly greater cholesterol levels than all other
genotypes on the same diet, with blood concentrations
11-, 6-, and 2-fold greater than those of wild-type, FXR/,
and ApoE/ mice, respectively (Table 1). After 12 weeks
on chow, triglyceride levels in both FXR/ and ApoE/
mice were 2-fold greater than those of wild-type mice on
the same diet. FXR/ApoE/ triglyceride levels remained
significantly higher than those of the other genotypes on
the same diet, with blood concentrations 5-, 2-, and 2-fold

greater than in wild-type, FXR/, and ApoE/ mice, re-
spectively (Table 1).
After 12 weeks on a HF/HC diet, blood levels of triglyc-
erides in both FXR/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice were 3-
and 2-fold greater than in wild-type and ApoE/ mice, respec-
tively. Plasma AST levels for chow-fed FXR/ApoE/ mice
were 4-fold greater compared with those in wild-type and
ApoE/ mice fed the same diet (Table 1). FXR/ApoE/
mice also had significantly greater plasma AST levels com-
pared with chow-fed FXR/ mice. HF/HC feeding led to
a general increase of plasma AST levels in all of the geno-
types studied. Similar to the chow-fed animals, the great-
est plasma AST levels measured were those of FXR/ and
FXR/ApoE/ mice. Blood glucose levels did not differ
significantly between groups at week 12 of the feeding
study (Table 1).
FXR/ApoE/ mice have a more severe proatherogenic 
plasma lipoprotein profile
Further characterization of alterations in blood lipids
caused by the deletion of FXR in the ApoE/ mouse in-
volved analysis of the lipoprotein profiles of these mice by
FPLC (Fig. 1). Fractions obtained at elution volumes of
14, 20, and 29 ml (corresponding to the VLDL, LDL, and
HDL2/3 peaks, respectively) were further characterized by
immunoblotting for apolipoprotein content (Fig. 1A, B,
insets). On either chow or the HF/HC diet, FXR/ mice
had increased VLDL and LDL lipids as well as reduced
HDL2/3 cholesterol, apoA-I, and apoA-II compared with
controls. The HDL peak was shifted toward smaller elu-
tion volumes (26–28 ml), indicating the presence of large
triglyceride-rich HDL1 particles only in the HF/HC-fed
FXR/ mice (Fig. 1A, C). In the ApoE/ background, FXR
deficiency increased the levels of VLDL apoB-48 and de-
creased those of HDL apoA-I and apoA-II. This was exac-
erbated by HF/HC feeding, with dramatically increased
apoB-48 associated with VLDL and LDL as well as decreased
apoA-I and apoA-II associated with HDL (Fig. 1B, inset) in
FXR/ApoE/mice.
Examination of the lipoprotein distribution patterns
for cholesterol in the plasma of chow-fed FXR/ApoE/
and ApoE/ mice revealed that FXR/ApoE/ mice had
the highest amount of cholesterol in the VLDL fractions.

other genotypes (Fig. 1B). In addition, FXR/ApoE/
animals had sharply increased VLDL triglyceride levels
compared with ApoE/ animals on both diets. Surpris-
ingly, plasma triglycerides, eluting mostly in the VLDL
range, were maximal in FXR/ApoE/ mice on both
chow and the HF/HC diet (Fig. 1D).
FXR/ApoE/ mice challenged with a HF/HC diet 
exhibit hepatic lipid accumulation, focal necrosis,
and inflammation
Given the importance of the liver in lipid homeostasis
and RCT, liver histology (HE examination for necrosis)
in HF/HC-fed groups in addition to levels of triglyceride
and cholesterol (in both chow- and HF/HC-fed mice)
were examined. HE staining of liver from HF/HC-fed
mice revealed that both FXR/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice
had areas of focal necrosis, as indicated by localized accu-
mulation of cells (most likely neutrophils and/or acti-
vated lymphocytes; Fig. 2A, arrowheads) (30). Similar in-
dications of necrosis were not evident in the livers from
HF/HC-fed wild-type and ApoE/ mice. A qualitative ap-
proach to examine the hepatic accumulation of lipid was
used by staining 10 m sections of liver with Oil Red O
(stains lipids red; Fig. 2A). Livers from FXR/ and FXR/
ApoE/ mice have increased lipid accumulation on a HF/
HC diet compared with wild-type and ApoE/ mice on the
same diet (seen as large red vacuoles present in liver sec-
tions).
Lipids were organically extracted from liver tissue and
measured using commercial colorimetric kits for both
cholesterol and triglycerides. Interestingly, HF/HC feed-
ing of FXR/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice led to 4-fold in-
creases in hepatic cholesterol over chow-fed mice of the
same genotype compared with only 2- and 1.6-fold in-
creases in wild-type and ApoE/ mice, respectively (Fig.
2C). After 12 weeks on a HF/HC diet, FXR/ and FXR/
ApoE/ mice had increased hepatic concentrations of
cholesterol, with increases of 2-fold over both HF/HC-
fed wild-type and ApoE/ mice (Fig. 2C). HF/HC feeding
increased hepatic triglycerides in FXR/ mice (5-fold),
FXR/ApoE/ mice (3-fold), and wild-type mice (2-fold)
compared with the respective chow-fed controls (Fig. 2D).
Similarly, both FXR/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice fed the
HF/HC diet had increased levels of hepatic triglycerides
compared with wild-type and ApoE/ groups on the same
diet. Hepatic triglyceride concentrations in the FXR/
mice were 2- and 3-fold greater than those of wild-type
and ApoE/ animals on the same diet, respectively (Fig.
2D). In accordance with the increased hepatic lipid accu-
mulation, the liver weights (as a percentage of body
weight) were increased for both HF/HC-fed FXR/ and
FXR/ApoE/ mice (5.4 
 0.6 and 5.5 
 0.6, respec-
tively) compared with wild-type (3.9 
 0.5) and ApoE/
(4.3 
 0.4) (Fig. 2E) mice fed the same diet.
In addition to histological and lipid analyses of livers
from these mice, expression of the genes for TNF- and
MAC1 (markers of inflammation) was examined using
real-time quantitative PCR. Chow-fed FXR/, ApoE/,
and FXR/ApoE/ mice had 3- to 4-fold higher levels
of TNF- expression compared with wild-type mice fed
the same diet (Fig. 2F). HF/HC feeding dramatically in-
creased TNF- mRNA levels in both FXR/ and ApoE/
mice to 10-fold over chow-fed wild-type mice. FXR/
ApoE/ mice exhibited a synergistic increase in TNF-
gene expression to 40-fold over wild-type values (Fig.
2F). Similar to the TNF- expression patterns, both FXR/
and ApoE/ mice fed chow had similar mRNA expression
(5-fold over wild-type values) of hepatic MAC1 (Fig. 2G).
Chow-fed FXR/ApoE/ mice had 12-fold higher ex-
pression than wild-type mice on the same diet. HF/HC
feeding led to increases in MAC1 mRNA levels (15- to
17-fold over chow-fed wild-type mice) in both FXR/ and
ApoE/ mice. Similar to TNF- expression, MAC1 tran-
script levels showed a synergistic increase in HF/HC-fed
FXR/ApoE/ mice (68-fold higher than in the wild
type).
Deletion of FXR results in more severe atherosclerosis in 
ApoE/ mice
Determination of atherosclerosis was performed using
cross-sectional as well as en face representations of aortas
(stained for lipid-filled plaques) from all animals on both
chow and the HF/HC diet (Fig. 3). Examination of both
en face and cross-sectional aortas from the chow-fed mice
revealed that neither wild-type nor FXR/ animals had
any detectable plaques on this diet (Fig. 3A, B). Both FXR/
ApoE/ and ApoE/ mice fed chow had small amounts
of detectable plaques in both cross-sectional and en face
representations (Fig. 3A, B). The extent of atherosclerosis
in aortas from these chow-fed ApoE/FXR/ and ApoE/
mice, as determined by quantitation of en face plaques,
was not significantly different (Fig. 4A). Challenging both
wild-type and FXR/ mice with a HF/HC diet did not re-
sult in detectable atherosclerotic plaques, as indicated by
cross-sectional or en face aortas from these mice (Fig. 3A,
B). In contrast, HF/HC feeding of ApoE/ and FXR/
ApoE/ mice resulted in large increases in the extent of
atherosclerosis in aortas of these mice (Fig. 3A, B). Quan-
titation of atherosclerosis in en face aortas from these
mice revealed that the FXR/ApoE/ mice had approxi-
mately double the amount of plaques compared with the
ApoE/ mice (37.2 
 11.4% relative to 18.2 
 3.2%)
(Fig. 4B).
DISCUSSION
This study investigated the pathological consequences
of deficient FXR function for the development of athero-
sclerotic disease. Challenging mice that lacked both func-
tional FXR and apoE genes with a HF/HC diet led to a
failure to gain weight to a similar extent and decreased
survival compared with wild-type, FXR/, and ApoE/
mice fed the same diet. Loss of functional FXR also led to
further increases of total blood cholesterol and triglycer-

ide levels as well as increased VLDL and LDL in the
ApoE/ model. HF/HC-fed FXR/ApoE/ mice experi-
enced the greatest detrimental effects on hepatic status, as
shown by massive lipid accumulation, focal necrosis, and
markedly increased inflammatory gene expression and
plasma AST levels. Ultimately, all of these phenotypic
characteristics were associated with the most severe de-
gree of atherosclerotic lesion formation and the lowest
survivability in the HF/HC-fed FXR/ApoE/ mice com-
pared with the other genotypes studied.
Our previous work demonstrated decreased hepatic ex-
pression of the scavenger receptor class B type I in FXR/
mice. This was associated with decreased hepatic uptake
of HDL cholesterol as well as increased synthesis of highly

atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins (23). Addition-
ally, FXR/ mice exhibit hyperabsorption of cholesterol
(23) and triglycerides (unpublished results) from the in-
testine. All of these factors are believed to contribute to
the proatherogenic plasma total lipid and lipoprotein pro-
file exhibited by FXR/ mice. ApoE is required for he-
patic LDL receptor-mediated clearance of remnants of
VLDL in the liver (31), and consistent with previous stud-
ies (32, 33), we observed an almost complete absence of
HDL in the plasma of ApoE/ mice. Thus, the extremely
atherogenic plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile exhib-
ited by FXR/ApoE/ mice, particularly when chal-
lenged with a HF/HC diet, reflects the striking genetic in-
teraction between the loss of function of the FXR and
apoE alleles.

vealed that both FXR/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice had ar-
eas of focal necrosis that were absent from the livers of

ApoE/ and wild-type mice fed the same diet. Consistent
with this observation, HF/HC-fed FXR/ and FXR/
ApoE/ mice also exhibited the highest levels of plasma
AST, which may have resulted from the release of this en-
zyme from necrotic hepatocytes. Hepatic lipid accumula-
tion is a hallmark feature of the pathogenesis of necrotic
liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (34).
Thus, given the massive hepatic accumulation of lipid in
both FXR/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice, it is not surprising
that chronic HF/HC feeding caused damage to the livers
of these animals. Furthermore, FXR/ mice present with
a cholestatic phenotype characterized by increased plasma
bile acids (24). This may have also contributed to the he-
patic necrosis seen in FXR/ and FXR/ApoE/ mice
when fed a HF/HC diet. Indicators of an altered inflam-
matory state in the liver included changes in expression of
the immune receptor MAC1 and the inflammatory cyto-
kine TNF-. MAC1, also known as CD11b/CD18 and com-
plement receptor 3, is predominantly expressed on mac-
rophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer cells
and is involved in many functions, including activation
and migration of these cells (35). TNF- is a proinflamma-
tory cytokine released by tissue macrophages and T-cells at
a site of injury and essentially acts to activate and attract
other immune cells (36). TNF- has also been shown to
induce the upregulation of MAC1 in neutrophils (37).
Therefore, the dramatic increase of MAC1 and TNF-
mRNA levels in the livers of HF/HC-fed FXR/ApoE/
mice most likely represented the combined effects of in-
flammation-induced expression of these genes in hepato-
cytes and infiltrating cells of the immune system such
as macrophages and neutrophils. In addition, increased
TNF- levels in the FXR/ApoE/ mice may have added
to the induction of MAC1 expression in these immune
cells. Combined with the failure to gain as much body
weight and reduced survival compared with the other
genotypes, these data suggest that hepatic toxicity and
severe dysfunction occurred in the HF/HC-challenged
FXR/ApoE/ mice.
Although loss of FXR function alone was not sufficient
to cause atherosclerosis when mice were challenged with a
HF/HC diet, the combination of FXR deficiency with that
of apoE resulted in a dramatic worsening of the disease.
Unlike humans, mice transport the majority of plasma lip-
ids in HDL particles, and this is thought to contribute to
the inherent resistance of this species to atherosclerotic
disease. Compared with wild-type animals, FXR/ mice
exhibit a proatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile char-
acterized by the presence of increased amounts of highly
atherogenic VLDL and LDL particles in the plasma.
Therefore, it was somewhat surprising that no atheroscle-
rosis was detected in the FXR/ mice fed the HF/HC
diet. ApoE is synthesized in large quantities by the liver, is
a constituent of all lipoproteins except LDL, and func-
tions as a ligand for receptors that clear chylomicrons and
VLDL remnants from the blood (32). ApoE is also synthe-
sized by monocytes and macrophages and is thought to
promote cholesterol efflux and modulate inflammatory
responses in atherosclerotic vessels (33). Thus, the in-
creased susceptibility of ApoE/ mice to spontaneous and
diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions results from a loss of
critical functions in at least two sites, the liver and macro-
phage. In contrast, although FXR has well-defined regula-
tory roles in hepatic function, the expression of this re-
ceptor in macrophages is undetectable (unpublished
results) (38). Thus, despite the severe proatherogenic
plasma lipid profile of FXR/ mice, it is likely that macro-
phages in the vessel walls of these mice remain resistant to
lipid accumulation and plaque formation. Only when the
loss of functional FXR was combined with the loss of apoE
was a genetic interaction resulting in more severe dyslipid-
emia, impaired hepatic function, and atherosclerosis re-
vealed.
Recently, treatment with the selective FXR agonist
GW4064 was shown to prevent the development of gall-
stones in a mouse model of the disease (39). Importantly,
this study demonstrated that modulation of FXR could be
used to treat a specific disease process and more gener-
ally illustrated the therapeutic potential of targeting this
receptor. At present, however, the benefits of manipulat-
ing FXR function as a novel therapeutic approach for
atherosclerosis are not clear. Presumably, activation of
FXR in vivo would lead to decreased conversion of cho-
lesterol to bile acids, an effect detrimental to the treat-
ment of coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia.
However, data generated in our study as well as previous

Hanniman et al. Loss of FXR increases atherosclerosis 2603
work with FXR/ mice have demonstrated that the role
of FXR in lipid homeostasis is more complicated than
previously thought. For instance, FXR/ mice exhibit in-
creased intestinal absorption of cholesterol and triglycer-
ides, decreased hepatic uptake of HDL, and increased
synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins (23). All of
these characteristics associated with the loss of FXR func-
tion suggest that antagonism of this receptor would lead
to an undesirable disruption of systemic lipid homeosta-
sis that ultimately may be detrimental to the treatment of
atherosclerosis. In addition, it is not known whether mod-
ulation of hepatic FXR function can affect the inflamma-
tory state at the level of the vessel wall in addition to that
seen in the liver in this study. Studies of the lipid-lowering
mechanism of an herbal product, guggulsterone, re-
vealed antagonism of FXR and a decrease of hepatic cho-
lesterol accumulation (21, 22) as well as hypolipidemic
effects and increased hepatic LDL uptake (40). These
findings lead to the question of why antagonism of FXR
by guggulsterone is lipid-lowering but targeted disruption
of the FXR gene leads to hyperlipidemia and increased
atherosclerosis when combined with loss of apoE func-
tion. One answer to this controversy may be provided by
recent work demonstrating that guggulsterone antago-
nizes a number of nuclear receptors (including glucocor-
ticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen receptors) with
up to 100-fold greater potency than that exhibited for
FXR (41). Furthermore, guggulsterone is also a potent
activator of a number of other nuclear receptors, includ-
ing the estrogen, progesterone, and pregnane X recep-
tors (42). Therefore, the in vivo effects of guggulsterone
are likely to be mediated by several mechanisms other
than antagonism of FXR.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that loss of FXR
function causes increased atherosclerosis in the ApoE/
mouse model of this disease. Other outcomes precipitated
by the loss of FXR in this model included decreased
weight gain and survival, increased hepatic and plasma
lipids, increased hepatic inflammation, and a more severe
plasma lipoprotein profile. This study is the first to dem-
onstrate a pathogenic role for FXR in atherosclerosis us-
ing an in vivo model of the disease. In contrast to other
nuclear receptors with roles in macrophage lipid homeo-
stasis (e.g., liver X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-acti-
vated receptors), the worsening of atherosclerosis caused
by targeted deletion of FXR appears to be a consequence
of the loss of function of this receptor in liver and gut
only. Our data demonstrate the pathological consequences
of a lack of FXR function and the potential for genetic in-
teractions of deleterious mutations of the gene for this nu-
clear receptor with other gene mutations known to in-
crease the risk for cardiovascular disease.
