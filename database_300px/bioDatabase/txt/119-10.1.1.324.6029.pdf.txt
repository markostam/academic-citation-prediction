Abstract—Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl–coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase used in the prevention
of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition to their cholesterol-lowering activities, statins exert pleiotropic
antiinflammatory effects, which might contribute to their beneficial effects not only on CVD but also on lipid-unrelated
immune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, stroke, and transplant rejection. However, the
molecular mechanisms involved in these antiinflammatory properties of statins are unresolved. Here we show that the
peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)  mediates antiinflammatory effects of simvastatin in vivo in
models of acute inflammation. The inhibitory effects of statins on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response
genes were abolished in PPAR-deficient macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, simvastatin inhibited PPAR
phosphorylation by lipopolysaccharide-activated protein kinase C (PKC) . A constitutive active form of PKC
inhibited nuclear factor B transrepression by PPAR whereas simvastatin enhanced transrepression activity of
wild-type PPAR, but not of PPAR mutated in its PKC phosphorylation sites. These data indicate that the acute
antiinflammatory effect of simvastatin occurs via PPAR by a mechanism involving inhibition of PKC inactivation
of PPAR transrepression activity. (Circ Res. 2006;98:361-369.)

Statins, competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglu-taryl–coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-
limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, are widely pre-
scribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.1 In
addition to plasma lipid-modulating action, statins exert
pleiotropic antiinflammatory effects, which might contribute
to their beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD).2
Emerging evidences also suggest beneficial therapeutic ac-
tivities of statins in immune and inflammatory diseases such
as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, ischemic stroke,
transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma.3–6 Several
clinical observations indicate that these effects cannot be
attributed to their cholesterol-lowering activities only.7 Statin
therapy decreases plasma concentrations of inflammatory
markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), within 1 week
after treatment initiation, before any lipid changes are ob-
served.8 Statin treatment reduces the incidence of ischemic
stroke for which plasma cholesterol levels are not considered
a risk factor.9 Moreover, statins also exert antiinflammatory
actions in animal models, which are resistant to their hypo-
lipidemic actions.10 In models of acute and chronic inflam-
mation, statins inhibit endothelial adhesion and transendothe-
lial migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation,10 acting
both on endothelial cells and leukocytes. Statins modulate
macrophage functions by inhibiting the activation of inflam-
matory response genes, such as interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) , metalloproteinase (MMP)-2,
and MMP-9, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).11
These antiinflammatory actions of statins are attributed to
their ability to modulate signal transduction pathways acti-
vating proinflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear
factor (NF) B.12
PPAR is a nuclear receptor that regulates gene expression
by binding with its heterodimeric partner the retinoid-X-
receptor (RXR) to PPAR-responsive elements (PPREs).
PPAR not only regulates lipid metabolism13 but also exerts
pronounced antiinflammatory activities.14 Clinical trials have
shown that fibrates decrease inflammation and have benefi-
cial effects on CVD and stroke.14,15 In animals, PPAR
deficiency induces a prolonged inflammatory response in a

mouse ear-swelling model. PPAR exerts antiinflammatory
activities by negatively interfering with proinflammatory
signaling pathways including NFB. This molecular action is
exemplified by the inhibition of inflammatory induction of
genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, MMP-9,
IL-6, and TNF.14
These similarities between the antiinflammatory effects of
statins and PPAR led us to investigate whether PPAR
could mediate antiinflammatory effects of statins in vivo in
models of acute inflammation and in vitro in macrophages
and neutrophils.
Materials and Methods
Inflammation Tests
Subcutaneous dorsal pouches and carrageenan footpad edema were
induced in C57BL6 wild-type and PPAR-null mice as described.16,17
Simvastatin at indicated doses or vehicle (CMC 0.5%) was given by
gavage to mice 1 hour before inflammatory challenges (see the online
data supplement available at http://circres.ahajournals.org).
Cell Culture
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-elicited neutrophils from air pouches and
thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were isolated as de-
scribed.18 Cells were treated with the indicated reagents (see the
online data supplement).
RNA Analysis
RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol reagent followed by
reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Cergy-Pontoise,
France). cDNA was quantified by real-time PCR on a MX4000
apparatus (Stratagene) using specific primers (see the online data
supplement).
Kinase Assays and Immunoblot
After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and suspended in
protein kinase C (PKC) lysis buffer, sonicated (Vibracell Hiddock
72442), and centrifuged at 4°C (3000 rpm, 15 minutes). Cell extracts
(10 g) or cell extract–immunoprecipitated PKC (200 g) were
incubated in kinase reaction buffer, histone H1 (1 g), or purified
PPAR protein (400 ng) as substrates and (-32P)ATP (5 Ci) (2000
Ci/mmol). Kinase reactions were performed as described previous-
ly.19 Immunoblots were performed using the Aurora detection
system (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Orsay, France) (see the online data
supplement).
Transient Transfections and Metabolic Labeling
COS-7 cells were transfected by lipofection with reporter and
expression plasmids as indicated and incubated overnight with
DMEM supplemented with 2% Ultroser. Cells were collected and
luciferase and -galactosidase assays performed. For 35S-methionine
labeling, cells were cultured in methionine-free minimum essential
medium for 1 hour before supplementation with 35S-methionine (100
Ci) for an additional 3 hours. For 33P-phosphate labeling, cells were
deprived in phosphate-free minimum essential medium for 2 hours
before supplementing the medium with 33P-phosphate (500 Ci) for
5 hours, followed by PPAR immunoprecipitation (see the online
data supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined using nonparametric Mann–
Whitney or multivariate ANOVA tests followed by Scheffe post hoc
or the unpaired t tests (transient transfections). Values of P0.05
were considered as significant.
Results
PPAR Mediates the Acute Antiinflammatory
Action of Simvastatin In Vivo
To investigate whether PPAR plays a role in inflammatory
response modulation by statins in vivo, the influence of
simvastatin was tested in wild-type and PPAR-null mice
using 2 models of acute inflammation in which statins display
antiinflammatory activity.16,17 Doses were chosen in accor-
dance with these previous studies.16,17 The acute antiinflam-
matory action of simvastatin (10 to 50 mg/kg) administered
orally 1 hour before LPS was first measured by the number of
neutrophils recruited in air pouches by LPS.16 Simvastatin
treatment decreased neutrophil recruitment in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 1A). Administration of a single
dose of atorvastatin (30 mg/kg) exerted similar effects on
neutrophil recruitment (not shown). Interestingly, the de-
crease of LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment by simvastatin
was only observed in wild-type, but not in PPAR-null mice
(Figure 1B). Similarly, in the carrageenan-induced footpad
inflammation mouse model,17 a single dose of simvastatin
given 1 hour before carrageenan injection blocked swelling
only in wild-type, but not in PPAR-null mice (Figure 1C).
These effects occurred independently of alterations in plasma
lipid levels, because plasma cholesterol levels did not change
after simvastatin treatment in either model (not shown). Thus,
PPAR mediates the lipid-independent acute antiinflamma-
tory activity of simvastatin in mice.
PPAR Mediates the Inhibition of LPS-Induced
Inflammatory Response Genes by Simvastatin in
Primary Macrophages and Neutrophils
Because neutrophils are a major cell type mediating the
inflammatory response in these in vivo models, the expres-
sion of PPAR was analyzed in LPS-elicited neutrophils
recovered from air pouches and compared with other cell
types. PPAR mRNA levels were highest in neutrophils,
whereas macrophages express similar levels as primary en-
dothelial cells, a cell type in which the antiinflammatory
effects of PPAR have been well documented20 (Figure 2A).
Subsequently, the role of PPAR in the modulation of
inflammatory response gene expression (iNOS, TNF, or
IL-6) by statins was investigated in macrophages and neutro-
phils isolated from wild-type and PPAR-null mice. Pretreat-
ment (2 hours) of macrophages isolated from wild-type mice
with a single dose of simvastatin, sufficient to inhibit HMG-
CoA reductase activity,18 significantly decreased LPS-
induced iNOS and IL-6 mRNA levels (Figure 2B and 2C). By
contrast, simvastatin was without effect in macrophages
isolated from PPAR-null mice. Similarly, pretreatment (2
hours) with simvastatin also significantly decreased LPS-
induced iNOS and TNF mRNA levels in neutrophils iso-
lated from wild-type but not from PPAR-null mice (Figure
2D and 2E). Simvastatin induced a dose-dependent decrease
in iNOS mRNA and protein levels after LPS induction only
in wild-type but not in PPAR-null macrophages (Figure 3A
and 3B). Atorvastatin and fluvastatin pretreatment also de-
creased LPS-induced iNOS expression in a PPAR-
dependent manner (Figure 3C and 3D). These data indicate

that the antiinflammatory effect of statins on LPS-induced
inflammatory response genes, such as iNOS, in macrophages
and neutrophils is PPAR dependent.
Previous studies have shown that statins induce the expres-
sion of apolipoprotein A-I in human hepatoma HepG2 cells
by modulating PPRE-dependent transcriptional activity of
PPAR.21 To determine whether statins also regulate PPRE-
dependent PPAR target genes in macrophages, the effects of
simvastatin on the induction of CPT1 mRNA levels, a gene
induced by PPAR in human primary macrophages,22 by the
PPAR agonist GW9578 were investigated. As expected,
GW9578 treatment (12 hours) increased CPT1 mRNA levels,
but simvastatin treatment did not influence this induction
(Figure 4A). By contrast, both simvastatin and GW9578
treatment decreased iNOS mRNA levels, and coincubation
with both compounds resulted in a more pronounced inhibi-

taneous dorsal air pouches of wild-type mice (PPAR/; n7 to 12/group). Acute inflammation was induced by injecting LPS (0.2
g/mouse) in CMC (1 mL, 0.5%) into the pouch. Simvastatin (Sim) (10, 30, 50 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered via gavage 1 hour
before LPS injection. The total number of neutrophils migrated into the pouch was counted after 4 hours LPS injection. B, Acute
inflammation was induced in subcutaneous dorsal air pouches of wild-type (PPAR/, n10) and PPAR-null (PPAR/, n7) mice.

tion of iNOS mRNA levels (Figure 4B). These results
indicate that, unlike in hepatocytes, simvastatin selectively
interferes in macrophages with PPAR inhibition of inflam-
matory response genes, likely by modulating PPAR-
dependent transrepression activity.
The PKC Signaling Pathway Is Involved in
LPS-Induced iNOS Expression and Is
Inhibited by Simvastatin
Because the effect of simvastatin on LPS-induced iNOS
expression occurs rapidly and requires PPAR, it was hy-
pothesized that simvastatin exerts its effects via posttransla-
tional modulation of PPAR activity. To determine which
signaling pathway mediates LPS-induced iNOS expression in
macrophages and neutrophils, the effects of different protein
kinase inhibitors, which inhibit the PKC or MAPK signaling
pathways, were tested. Incubation of macrophages with either
the PKC inhibitor Go¨6976, which selectively inhibits the
Ca2-dependent PKC and PKC isoforms, or the PKC
inhibitor Ro318220, which inhibits all Ca2-dependent PKC
isoforms, prevented LPS-induced iNOS expression, whereas
a MEK inhibitor U0126 was without effect (Figure 5A).
Similarly, Go¨6976 inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression in
neutrophils, whereas U0126 was without effect (Figure 5B).
To determine whether simvastatin modulates the Ca2-
dependent PKC signaling pathway in macrophages and neu-
trophils, its effect on the activity of PKC was investigated.
PKC was immunoprecipitated from LPS-activated macro-
phages or neutrophils and in vitro phosphorylation experi-
ments using purified histone H1 protein as substrate were
performed. LPS treatment induced PKC activity in macro-
phages, whereas LPS-elicited neutrophils already displayed
high basal PKC activity. Interestingly, pretreatment (2
hours) with simvastatin decreased PKC activity both in
macrophages and neutrophils (Figure 5C and 5D). In addi-

tion, simvastatin treatment also decreased LPS-induced
PKCII activity both in macrophages and neutrophils (not
shown). Thus, inhibition of the Ca2-dependent PKC signal-
ing pathway by simvastatin could be involved in the effects of
simvastatin on LPS-induced iNOS expression both in mac-
rophages and neutrophils.
To determine whether the Ca2-dependent PKC signaling
pathway is involved in the PPAR-dependent inhibition of
LPS-induced iNOS expression, the effect of Go¨6976 on
LPS-induced iNOS expression was investigated in macro-
phages isolated from wild-type and PPAR-null mice. Pre-
treatment (2 hours) of wild-type macrophages with Go¨6976
resulted in a decrease of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA levels
(Figure 6). By contrast, Go¨6976 was without effect in
macrophages isolated from PPAR-null mice. These results
suggest a role for PPAR in the control of LPS-induced
iNOS expression by the Ca2-dependent PKC signaling
pathway.
Simvastatin Decreases PPAR Phosphorylation by
LPS-Activated PKC
To determine whether PKC modulates PPAR phosphory-
lation in macrophages and whether statins influence this
phosphorylation, in vitro phosphorylation experiments using
purified PPAR protein as substrate were performed using
extracts from LPS-stimulated macrophages pretreated with
simvastatin. Incubation with LPS induced the activity of
kinases that phosphorylate PPAR in vitro. This effect was
prevented by both simvastatin and Go¨6976 (Figure 7A),
whereas mPKCI, an inhibitor of all PKC isoforms, inhibited
both basal and LPS-stimulated PPAR phosphorylation.
Furthermore, PKC immunoprecipitated from LPS-activated
macrophages was able to phosphorylate PPAR and this
effect was inhibited by simvastatin pretreatment (Figure 7B).
To confirm that simvastatin prevents PKC-induced PPAR
phosphorylation in cells, metabolic labeling experiments
were performed in PPAR and PKC-transfected COS cells.
PKC induced the phosphorylation of PPAR, an effect that
was inhibited by simvastatin (Figure 7C). Thus, LPS-induced
PPAR phosphorylation occurs, at least partly, via PKC in
macrophages and simvastatin inhibits this phosphorylation.
Simvastatin Increases PPAR Transrepression
Activity on NFB via Its PKC
Phosphorylation Sites
We have recently shown that the PKC signaling pathway
modulates the transrepression activity of PPAR in hepato-
cytes via the PKC phosphorylation sites S179 and S230.19
Because the antiinflammatory action of PPAR is, at least
partly, mediated by the repression of NFB transcriptional
activity via direct interaction with NFB-p65 protein,23,24 it
was investigated whether phosphorylation of PPAR on its
PKC sites modulates its transrepression activity on NFB-
p65. To eliminate confounding effects of NFB-activating
pathways, PPAR activity was directly tested on nuclear-ac-
tivated NFB by using a chimeric protein composed of the
yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to p65 and a reporter
vector driven by a GAL4 response element.23 Cells were

was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using an anti-PKC antibody. PKC activity was assayed using purified histone H1 protein

cotransfected with increasing concentrations of PPAR wild
type or PPAR mutated in its PKC phosphorylation sites,
PPAR(S179A-S230A), a nonphosphorylatable, nonphos-
phomimetic mutant. At all concentrations tested,
PPAR(S179A-S230A) induced a more pronounced inhibi-
tion of p65-driven reporter activity compared with wild-type
PPAR (Figure 8A), suggesting that PKC phosphorylation of
PPAR inhibits PPAR transrepression activity on NFB.
To demonstrate a role for PKC in the transrepression
activity of PPAR on NFB-p65, a constitutive active form
of PKC (CA-PKC) was tested on p65 transrepression by
wild-type PPAR or PPAR(S179A-S230A). To obtain op-
timal sensitivity, wild-type PPAR was transfected at a
concentration ratio exerting clear, basal repression of p65-
driven transcriptional activity. Under these conditions, co-
transfection of CA-PKC prevented repression of p65-driven
transcriptional activity by wild-type PPAR. By contrast,
CA-PKC did not repress the activity of PPAR(S179A-
S230A) (Figure 8B).
Finally, to determine whether statin treatment modulates
PPAR transrepression activity on NFB via its PKC phos-
phorylation sites, the effect of simvastatin was tested on p65
transrepression by wild-type PPAR or PPAR(S179A-
S230A). In this experiment, PPAR wild type was trans-
fected at a concentration ratio that does not yet influence
p65-driven transcriptional activity. Under these conditions,
incubation with simvastatin induced a significantly more
pronounced inhibition of p65-driven transcriptional activity
in the presence of wild-type PPAR, an effect that was not
observed with PPAR(S179A-S230A) (Figure 8C). These
results indicate that inhibition of PKC by simvastatin
enhances PPAR transrepression activity on NFB.
Discussion
Clinical trials and in vitro studies have shown that statins and
PPAR agonists share antiinflammatory properties by regu-
lating inflammatory-response genes.14,25 In the present study,
using 2 well-characterized animal models of acute inflamma-
tion, we demonstrate that simvastatin requires PPAR ex-
pression to exert its antiinflammatory effects in vivo. The in

vivo antiinflammatory effects of simvastatin on footpad
swelling and neutrophil recruitment in air pouch–bearing
mice already occur within 1 hour after a single oral admin-
istration, indicating that the PPAR-dependent antiinflamma-
tory effects of simvastatin occur rapidly. The observed
effects, therefore, cannot be explained by the plasma lipid-
lowering activities of the drug. Indeed, as previously shown,17
simvastatin treatment did not change lipid levels in mice (not
shown). Thus, simvastatin exerts direct antiinflammatory
effects via PPAR, independent of its plasma cholesterol-
lowering activities.
The involvement of PPAR in the antiinflammatory ef-
fects of statins is further evidenced in vitro in experiments
with primary macrophages and neutrophils, 2 cell types
mediating acute inflammatory responses. PPAR activators
act on a variety of vascular cells such as endothelial cells
(ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), monocytes/
macrophages, and T cells, which all express PPAR.14
Although PPAR mRNA is expressed at low levels in
peritoneal macrophages, it clearly plays a functional role
in the antiinflammatory effects of simvastatin in vitro and in
vivo, as evidenced by the lack of simvastatin effects on
PPAR-deficiency. These results are consistent with a recent
study showing that PPAR prevents macrophage foam cell
formation in the peritoneal cavity.26 In addition, we show that
neutrophils express high levels of PPAR mRNA. In these
cells, PPAR also mediates the antiinflammatory effects of
simvastatin, thus identifying a novel cell type in which
PPAR exerts antiinflammatory activities.
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the
existence of a cross-talk between statins and PPAR in the
regulation of lipid-independent inflammatory responses.
These results thus extend previous studies on liver and lipid
metabolism,21,27,28 indicating that both hypolipidemic and
antiinflammatory effects of statins could involve PPAR.
We provide molecular evidence that statins modulate
Ca2-dependent PKC signaling pathway in macrophages
and neutrophils resulting in PPAR-dependent inhibition of
LPS-induced inflammatory response genes, such as iNOS.
These results are of particular interest because PKC plays a
role in the inflammatory response. In vivo overexpression of
PKC in the epidermis results in severe neutrophil-mediated
inflammation.29 In vitro in macrophages, PKC regulates
LPS-induced iNOS, TNF, and IL-1 expression.30 Our
results suggest the implication of other Ca2-dependent PKC
isoforms, such as PKCII, in the PPAR-dependent antiin-
flammatory effect of statins, because simvastatin inhibits also
LPS-induced PKCII activity in macrophages and neutro-
phils (not shown) and because PKCII also phosphorylates
PPAR on its PKC phosphorylation sites S179-S230 in
vitro.19 The mechanism underlying the activation of PKC by
LPS and the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on LPS-induced
PKC activation in macrophages and neutrophils is presently
unclear. Our results suggest that LPS induces PKC translo-
cation to the cell membrane in macrophages, but not in
neutrophils, and that simvastatin may block this effect (not
shown). It will be of interest to determine whether PKC

activators (PLC, PDK1) or repressors (DAGK or PP1 phos-
phatases)31 are regulated by simvastatin in these cells.
We previously demonstrated that classical PKCs phosphor-
ylate PPAR in vitro.19 Here, we show that LPS induction of
PKC in macrophages results in increased PPAR phosphor-
ylation in vitro and that PKC overexpression increased
PPAR phosphorylation in cells. Moreover, simvastatin in-
hibited PKC-induced PPAR phosphorylation. PPAR is a
phosphoprotein phosphorylated by different kinases, such as
extracellular signal-regulated kinase,32 p38,33 and PKA.34
Previously identified PPAR-phosphorylating kinases all en-
hanced PPAR transcriptional activity. In our report, we
show, by using PPAR mutated on its PKC phosphorylation
sites (S179-S230) as well as a CA-PKC, that activated
PKC inhibits the transrepression properties of PPAR on
NFB-p65. By contrast, simvastatin enhances PPAR trans-
repression activity acting via its PKC phosphorylation sites
(S179-S230), suggesting that simvastatin stimulates PPAR
transrepression activity via inhibition of PPAR inactivation
by PKC. Whereas in liver cells, the PKC signaling pathway
also regulates the ligand-dependent PPAR transactivation
properties, as demonstrated by enhanced CPT1 induction,19 in
macrophages, simvastatin treatment did not modify PPAR-
induced CPT1 expression, even in the presence of a PPAR
agonist. Inhibition of the Ca2-dependent PKC signaling
pathway by simvastatin thus only influences the transrepres-
sion properties of PPAR in macrophages. We propose that
activation of PKC by inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS,
leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent deactivation of
PPAR. Statins prevent PKC activation by LPS and, as a
consequence, inhibit PPAR phosphorylation by PKC,
leading to enhanced PPAR transrepressive activity on
NFB (Figure 8D).
The effects of statins on inflammation could also involve
NFB-independent mechanisms, eg, via modulation of
CD62L and CD11b adhesion molecule expression in mono-
cytes.35 However, we did not observe any effect of statins on
the expression of these adhesion molecules in neutrophils
(not shown). Nonetheless, our results do not exclude that
other PPAR- and PKC-independent mechanisms contribute
also to the antiinflammatory effects of statins because statins
regulate other signaling pathways such as phosphatidylinosi-
tol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase.36,37
Macrophages and neutrophils are mediators of the early
inflammatory response that play a major role in the inflam-
mation and tissue damage associated with both infectious and
noninfectious diseases, such as sepsis, acute coronary syn-
drome, rheumatoid arthritis, and ischemic stroke.38–41 Results
from basic research and clinical trials indicate that the
pleiotropic antiinflammatory effects of statins may result in
clinical benefit in such inflammatory diseases.42–44 Our re-
sults demonstrating that statins exert their antiinflammatory
effects through PPAR provide further evidence for the
importance of such pleiotropic activities. Clinical studies with
PPAR agonists have shown significant protective effects
against CVD and stroke, effects that cannot be attributed to
their cholesterol-lowering activities alone.14,15 Our results
thus provide a potential clinically relevant mechanism for the
pleiotropic effects of statins through PPAR.

Material and methods 
Inflammation tests 
Air-pouch model: Subcutaneous dorsal pouches were induced in female C57BL6 wild-type and 
PPARα-null mice, 8 weeks of age (7-12/group) was induced by injection of 5 ml of steril air 
followed 3 days later by reinjection of 3 ml of steril air 1. On day 6, LPS (0.2µg/mouse) in 1 ml of 
CMC (0.5%) was injected into the air-pouches. Simvastatin at indicated doses in CMC (0.5%) or 
vehicle (CMC) was given by oral administration to air pouch-bearing mice 1h before LPS 
injection for an additional 4h. The animals were then killed by cervical dislocation and the 
pouches were flushed with cold PBS (2 ml). The lavage fluid was immediately cooled on ice, its 
volume determined, and neutrophils counted using a haemocytometer. Viability, as determined 
by trypan blue exclusion, was consistently greater than 95%. Neutrophil purity, as determined 
by Wright's-stained cytospin preparations, was greater than 90-95%.  
Carrageenan footpad edema model: female C57BL6 wild-type and PPARα-null mice between 8 
and 12 weeks of age were used (12-14/group). Footpad swelling was induced by a single 
subplantar injection of 0,05 ml of a sterile 1% solution of carrageenan in water 2. Simvastatin at 
indicated doses in CMC (0.5%) or vehicle (CMC) was given by oral administration to mice 1h 
before carrageenan injection for an additional 3h. Footpad swelling was then measured using a 
micrometer and compared with the preinjection volume of the same paw. Swelling was then 
expressed in percent relative to the level of carrageenan-treated controls (CMC) group.  
 
Cell culture and treatments 
Murine endothelial cells from adipose tissue were isolated as described 3. Murine thioglycollate-
elicited peritoneal macrophages were isolated as described 4. Briefly, mouse peritoneal 
macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage with saccharose (0.34 mol/L) from mice given 
a 3 ml intraperitoneal injection of 4% thioglycollate (Sigma Aldrich, St Quentin, France) in water 
for 3 days. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free RPMI (GIBCO BRL), plated and 
allowed to adhere to dishes for 2h. Plates were then washed 3 times with RPMI to remove 
nonadherent cells and incubated in RPMI containing fetal calf serum (FCS, 10%) over night.

Then, cells were incubated in RPMI containing 1% Nutridoma for 24h before treatment. Murine 
LPS-elicited neutrophils were isolated from air-pouches after 4h LPS treatment and incubated in 
RPMI containing FCS (0.5%) and treated with the indicated reagents. COS-7 cells were cultured 
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with FCS (10%) and antibiotics 
at 37°C. Cells were treated with the indicated reagents (GW9578 (GlaxoSmithKline), U0126 and 
mPKCI (Promega, Madison, USA), Gö6976 and Ro318220 (Calbiochem, San Diego, 
California), E.coli 026:B6 LPS (Sigma Aldrich, St Quentin, France)). For in vitro studies, 
simvastatin (Zocor, Merck laboratories) was converted to the active compound 5. Atorvastatin 
(Pfizer) and fluvastatin (Novartis pharma) were diluted in DMSO  
 
RNA analysis 
RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol reagent and reverse transcription was performed 
according to the manufacturer's protocole (Invitrogen Life technologies, Cergy-Pontoise, 
France). RNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR using brilliant SYBR Green QPCR 
Master Mix on the MX4000 detection system (Stratagene). The amplifying primers were: murine 
PPARα (FOR: 5'-AGGCGGTTGCCACTGTTCAG-3' and REV: 5'-
AGCCCTCTTCATCCCCAAGC-3'), murine iNOS (FOR: 5'-TTGCCCCTGGAAGTTTCTCTTC-3’ 
and REV 5'-GGAGCCATTTTGGTGACTCTTAGT-3'), murine TNFα (FOR, 5'-
ATCCAGTTTGGTGTCGCGGAGC-3' and REV, 5'-CGTCGTCGTCGAAATGGGCATC-3'), 
murine IL-6 (FOR, 5'-CCAGTTGCCTTCTTGGGACTG-3' and REV, 5'-
CAGGTCTGTTGGGAGTGGTATCC-3') and murine CPT1 (FOR: 5'-
CATCATGACTATGCGCTACTC-3' and REV: 5'-CAGTGCTGTCATGCGTTGG-3') and as 
control, murine cyclophilin (FOR, 5'-GCATACGGGTCCTGGCATCTTGTCC-3' and REV, 
5'ATGGTGATCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGC-3'). Crossing threshold (Ct) values were determined for 
target genes and normalysed to the Ct of cyclophilin using the following equation: relative 
values= 2 –(Ct target gene- Ct cyclophilin) . Results are expressed as means -/+ SD (n=3) relative to the 
level of LPS-treated controls. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.

stopped by addition of 10 µl of 3X Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. 
For the purified PPARα protein substrate, kinase reaction was stopped by addition of ice cold 
RIPA with inhibitors and PPARα was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C using anti-PPARα 
polyclonal antibody as described previously 6. Immune complexes were incubated with 30 µl of 
protein-A sepharose beads for 1h at 4 °C and then washed once with RIPA, RIPA/NaCl 1 mol/L, 
RIPA/TNE and TNE. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 10 µl of 3X Laemmli buffer and 
electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For equal loading of purified 
poteins, gels electrophoresis were stained with coomassie blue (data not shown). Gels were 
then dried and incorporation of (γ-32P) ATP was visualised by autoradiography. Signal intensity 
corresponding to the various bands was quantified using the Image 1D software. 
 
Immunoblot 
After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and suspended in PKC lysis buffer for PKCα 
detection or lysis buffer (25 mmol/L Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.25 
mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L EGTA, 10 mmol/L NaF and 0.1% NP40) for other protein detection 
containing freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmol/L β-Glycerophosphate, 1 
mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 10 µg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 
4°C (14000 rpm, 30 min). Cell extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and

transferred onto PVDF membrane. Immunoblots were performed using the Aurora detection 
system (ICN pharmaceuticals, Orsay, France) as previously described 7 using anti-iNOS 
polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France), anti-PKCα C20 and anti-actin 
I19 polyclonal antibodies (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Le Perray en Yvelines, France). 
 
Transient transfection assay  
COS-7 cells, grown to 50%-60% confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, were 
transiently transfected by lipofection with reporter and expression plasmids as indicated in the 
figure legends. The GAL4-TkpGL3, pSG5-PPARαWT pSG5-PPARα(S179A-S230A) 8, GAL4-
p65 9, CA-PKCα 10 plasmids were obtained as described. The pCDNA-PKCα WT was a kind 
gift of Laurence Suaud. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was co-transfected as a control 
for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding 
empty vector. After 2h (COS-7 cells), cells were refed with DMEM supplemented with 2% 
Ultroser and incubated overnight. Cells were then treated as indicated in the figure legends. 
After the indicated time, cells were collected and subjected to luciferase and β-galactosidase 
assays. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.
