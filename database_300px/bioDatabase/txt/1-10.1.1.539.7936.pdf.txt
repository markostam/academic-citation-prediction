[1] Understanding the propagation and dissipation of an
atmospheric gravity wave (GW) in the thermosphere
requires an accurate dissipative GW dispersion relation,
the GWâ€™s horizontal wavelength and period, and the
background neutral winds and temperatures. Conversely,
if the GWâ€™s horizontal wavelength, period, and vertically-
varying vertical wavelengths are known instead along with
the background temperatures, then the background,
horizontal neutral winds along the GW propagation
direction can be calculated using GW dissipative theory.
Recent daytime observations using the Advanced Modular
Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) located in Poker Flat,
Alaska, the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR),
have obtained these latter parameters. Using PFISR data for
a GW on December 13, 2006, we calculate the average,
background, horizontal neutral winds at z  160â€“240 km.

1. Introduction
[2] Gravity waves (GWs) are created when neutral, stable
fluid is disturbed. In the ionosphere, propagating neutral
GWs push and pull plasma along the Earthâ€™s magnetic field
lines, which causes periodic advection and compression of
the plasma called traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs)
[e.g., Hocke and Schlegel, 1996]. Because the density
decreases nearly exponentially with altitude z, GW ampli-
tudes grow nearly exponentially with z prior to
dissipation. The most important sources of thermospheric
dissipation for high-frequency, large vertical wavelength
GWs are kinematic viscosity (n) and thermal diffusivity
(K) [Vadas and Fritts, 2005] (hereinafter referred to as
VF2005). Pitteway and Hines [1963] derived the first GW
dissipative dispersion relations that included n and K by
assuming the vertical wavenumber m to be complex,
implying explicit GW damping with altitude. One of these
dispersion relations was used to show how the vertical
tilting of TIDs with altitude observed by Thome [1964]
could be explained as a GW dissipating [Hines, 1968], since
this dispersion relation predicts that a GWâ€™s vertical wave-
length lz = 2p/m increases to infinity while dissipating.
However, this solution has several problems. The first is that
the dissipative effects of n and K were treated separately,
yielding different GW dispersion relations and amplitude
formulas. In fact, the possible unphysical growth of a GWâ€™s
amplitude with altitude for z ! 1 using the dispersion
relation for n only led Hines [1968] to utilize the dispersion
relation for K only. The second and more serious problem is
that these dispersion relations were derived by applying a
perturbation expansion to lowest order in n or K to the
complex GW solutions. Thus, these dispersion relations are
only valid where dissipation is weak, and thus cannot
accurately predict the changes in lz which occur during
strong dissipation.
[3] Recently, VF2005 derived a more complete GW
anelastic dispersion relation that includes n and K, and is
accurate during strong dissipation. This dispersion relation
reduces to the Boissinesq solution in the appropriate limit.
However, lz may increase or decrease with z during
dissipation, depending on the temperature and horizontal
winds.
[4] With this new dispersion relation, a wealth of infor-
mation can be unlocked from observations of individually-
propagating GWs if enough GW parameters are measured.
Recent PFISR observations are ideal, because GW horizon-
tal and vertical wavelengths and periods are measured. The
purpose of this paper is to calculate the average, neutral,
horizontal, background thermospheric winds using a single
GW observed by PFISR and GW dissipative theory.
2. GW Dissipative Theory
[5] VF2005 derived a GW anelastic dispersion relation
which is accurate during strong dissipation in the thermo-
sphere. This dispersion relation assumes that ion drag can
be neglected, which is a good assumption for GWs with
periods less than a few hours [Hines and Hooke, 1970]. This
is the exact solution for a high-frequency GW with phase
speed much less than the speed of sound, and which
propagates through an atmosphere with constant tempera-
ture, wind, viscosity coefficient m, and Prandtl number Pr.
Additionally, this GW must have lz  4pH during strong
dissipation for the kinematic viscosity, n = m/r, to be locally
constant, where H is the density scale height and r is the
mean density. After redefining the fluid variables to scale
out r, VF2005 postulated that the GW solution from a
temporally-localized source can be written as decaying
explicitly in time and implicitly in altitude. This is equiv-
alent to setting the wave frequency, rather than m = 2p/lz,
complex. This yields a complex dispersion relation which is
analytically separable into a GW dispersion relation and the
amplitude decay with time, unlike the inseparable complex

is the background, neutral wind along the direction of GW
propagation. U and V may include components from large-
scale waves and tides, GW dissipation, and ion drag on the
neutrals from ions accelerated from geomagnetic storms.
The neutral wind perpendicular to a GWâ€™s propagation
direction does not affect its propagation. If the neutral wind
vector changes direction with altitude, lH = 2p/kH is
constant if U and V are independent of x and y. Additionally,
assuming negligible reflection from viscosity, a GWâ€™s
amplitude grows in altitude as / 1/ ï¬ƒï¬ƒï¬ƒrp , but decays from
dissipation as exp(wIit), where (VF2005)

The ray-trace code which utilizes these expressions is
described by Vadas [2007]. Although lz (z) or UH(z) can be
determined using equation (1), ray-tracing is necessary to
determine a GWâ€™s amplitude as a function of altitude and/or
time via equation (3).
[6] One important assumption used to derive these
expressions is that the background wind shears are not too
large:
jlzj < 2pjUH= dUH=dzÃ° Ãžj: Ã°4Ãž
A typical F region GWwith lzâ€™ 100â€“300 km [e.g.,Djuth et
al., 1997] will refract according to equation (1) if dUH/dz <
UH (0.02â€“0.06) m/s/km, which is dUH/dz < (4â€“12) m/s/km
for UH â€™ 200 m/s. A GWâ€™s lz likely only reflects the actual
wind if equation (4) is satisfied everywhere in the thermo-
sphere; otherwise, lz likely reflects the average wind.
However, because of strong viscous damping, it is possible
that very large neutral vertical wind shears cannot be
maintained in the thermosphere. Note that lz can be
much larger than the shear depth because lz/2p = m
	1, not
lz, must be smaller than the depth of the shear from
equation (4).
3. The PFISR Measurements of GWs
[7] As described in detail by Nicolls and Heinselman
[2007], the 96-panel AMISR system, the PFISR, is located
at the Poker Flat Research Range (65.13N, 147.47W)
near Fairbanks, Alaska. AMISR technology allows the
experimenter to steer the beam on a pulse-to-pulse basis
using phased array techniques, thereby pointing essentially
simultaneously at multiple positions in the sky. Since PFISR
began operations in late 2006, clearly identifiable wave
signatures have been observed in many datasets taken
during the daytime (when there is significant F-region
ionization and the wave signatures can be distinguished
from auroral effects), with varying periods and wavelengths.
[8] Nicolls and Heinselman [2007] report on recent
PFISR observations of GWs made on December 13, 2006.
Figure 1 shows themeasured electron densities,Ne, the relative
electron density perturbations, dNe/Ne = (Ne 	 Ne)/Ne, the
line-of-sight (los) ion velocities, Vlos, and the filtered Vlos.
The background electron density, Ne, is computed via low
pass filtering on a beam-by-beam basis which removes
waves with periods less than 35 minutes. The filtered Vlos
perturbations are computed by applying a band-pass filter to
Vlos to remove waves with periods less than 10 min and
greater than 35 min. The banded structures clearly indicate
the presence of GWs, with downward moving phases indicat-
ing upward-propagating GWs. One GW is present at 21:00â€“
22:00 UT, while another is present at 22:00â€“23:30 UT.
Local standard time is LST = UT-9. The slopes of the GW
phases change with altitude, indicating changes of lz with
altitude, since the GW phase is proportional to exp(i
R
mdz).
For the GW from 22:00â€“23:30 UT, the relative electron
density perturbations are largest at z  180â€“200 km, while
Vlos peaks at higher altitudes, z  220 km. Additionally, Vlos
lags in phase by 90 behind dNe/Ne. This phase lag, and the
result that the ion density and Vlos peak at different altitudes,
follows from the ion continuity equation (S. L. Vadas and
M. J. Nicolls, Temporal evolution of neutral, thermospheric
winds and plasma response, manuscript in preparation,
2007, hereinafter referred to as Vadas and Nicolls,
manuscript in preparation, 2007). Note that Vlos are small,
10â€“20 m/s, indicative of low geomagnetic activity. The
plasma oscillations are induced by the GW via neutral-ion
collisions. Because the ions are confined to move along the
magnetic field line, the Vlos perturbation (i.e., the oscillatory
component of Vlos) approximately equals the GW vertical
velocity, w0, since the magnetic field is nearly vertical at
Poker Flat (PF), with a dip angle I = 77. We therefore
estimate w0  15 m/s for this GW at z  220 km.
[9] Using dNe/Ne, Nicolls and Heinselman [2007] deter-
mined that the GW from 22:00â€“23:30 UT had lx = 373 Â±
28 km, ly = 	216 Â± 12 km, lH = 187 Â± 8 km, and a ground-
based period of tr = 22.3 Â± 1.1 min. The GWâ€™s ground-
based horizontal phase speed was cH = wr/kH = lH/tr  140
m/s. Vertical profiles of lx and ly are shown in Figure 2a,
along with the propagation angle counterclockwise from
east, q = tan	1(lx/ly). This GW was propagating 30 east
of south. Since this GW has a period much less than a few
hours, its amplitude and dispersion are likely unaffected by
ion drag. Figure 2b shows the measured lz profile, calcu-
lated from the averaged phase slopes of dNe/Ne from the 2
wave pulses between 22:00â€“22:50 UT from the vertical-
ly-pointed beam. jlzj increases rapidly from lz  	150 km

at z = 160 km, peaks at z = 190 km with lz  	400 km, and
decreases rapidly for higher altitudes to lz  	200 km.
4. GW Propagation and Dissipation
[10] Using the MSIS temperature T shown in Figure 2c
from the NRLMSISE-00 model [Hedin, 1991], Pr = 0.7, and
m = 3.34  10	4 T0.71 gm m	1 s	1, we ray-traced the GW
observed by PFISR through zero winds. lz is shown in
Figure 2b. Since jlzj is much smaller than the measured
values, the background winds must have been strong and
opposite to the GWâ€™s propagation direction. We also ray-
trace this GW through a northward wind of 200 m/s shown
in Figure 2c, which has a projection along the GW
propagation direction of V sin(q)  	170 m/s. lz is shown
in Figure 2b. Here, jlzj increases to much larger values
than for zero wind, consistent with the data for z  160 km
and z  210â€“230 km; however, jlzj significantly under-
estimates the data for z  170â€“200 km.
[11] Although the ray-trace lz curves in Figure 2b could
have been computed from equation (1), the GW amplitudes
can only be determined via ray-tracing. We show in
Figure 2b the altitudes where the ray-traced GW momentum
fluxes, u0w0, are maximum, zdiss, as a square and triangle for
the zero wind and northward wind, respectively. Comparing
with Figure 1, dNe/Ne maximizes at a lower altitude than
zdiss. This occurs because the electron density perturbation
does not peak where the GW amplitude peaks; rather, the
ion density responds most strongly to rapid changes with
altitude in the background electron density and/or the
GW amplitude. Additionally, the GWâ€™s ray-traced vertical
velocity, w0, peaks at z  225 km, consistent with the peak
altitude for Vlos along the B-field direction (Vadas and
Nicolls, manuscript in preparation, 2007). Since the rapid
changes in lz occur well below zdiss, these changes are due
to background wind variations rather than dissipation.
[12] Using the lz(z) data from Figure 2b, we solve
equation (1) iteratively for wIr(z) starting at the lowest
altitude where n is negligible, and using wIr solutions as
initial guesses as z is increased. Figure 2d shows this GWâ€™s
vertically-varying intrinsic wave period, tIr = 2p/wIr,
and the buoyancy period, 2p/N. Note that tIr  11 min at
z  160 km, decreases to 8 min at z  190 km, and
increases to 11 min at z  220 km. Although tIr is close to

the buoyancy period at z  190 km, tIr(z) > 2p/N. If tIr =
2p/N, an upward-propagating GW reflects downward.
5. Neutral Wind Along GW Direction
[13] Because wr and lH are constant with altitude, the
variation of wIr with altitude is due to neutral, background
winds. Using equation (2), the neutral, average background
wind projected along the direction of GW propagation is

 
: Ã°5Ãž
Using tIr(z) from Figure 2d, we show UH(z) in
Figure 2e. Note that the angle ofUH counterclockwise from
east is q. As expected, the neutral wind projection is opposite
to the GW propagation direction. Although the calculated
winds are 	160 m/s at z  160 km and z  220 km,
consistent with tidal amplitudes, they are much larger at z
 190 km: UH  	250 m/s. This rapid increase and
decrease over a vertical depth of 40 km likely is not due
to thermospheric tides, because tidal amplitudes are
viscously-limited above z  150 km [e.g., Roble,
1995]. Note that lz/2p < 65 km, which implies that the
extracted, average winds are marginally resolved by this
GW vertically-varying parameters.
[14] These extracted winds, UH, are somewhat sensitive
to T . An increase in T by 20% causes a decrease in N of
10% and an increase in H of 20%, using the isothermal
expressions N2 / T	1 and H / T [e.g., Vadas and Fritts,
2006]. We ignore H for this GW because kH
2  1/4H2 and
d  0 at z < 210 km. A decrease in N by 10% causes a
decrease in wIr by 10% from equation (1), which causes
a Â±10wIr/kHjUHj  Â±15% increase/decrease in jUHj from
equation (2), depending on the sign of UH. Since UH < 0,
a 20% decrease (increase) of T to 650 and 1000 K results
in a 15% increase (decrease) of the extracted neutral wind
at z  180 km by 40 m/s for this GW.
6. Total Neutral Thermospheric Wind
[15] Vlos consists of oscillatory and mean components.
Figure 3a shows the mean component of Vlos, defined as
Vap, obtained by averaging Vlos along the B-field direction
for 1 hour from 22â€“23 UT. At PF, the declination angle is
22 east of north. This approximately constant plasma
motion results from a combination of 1) ion diffusion and
2) ion drag acting on the component of the background
neutral wind along the magnetic meridian, and has often
been used to infer the neutral winds along the magnetic
meridian with ISR measurements [e.g., Buonsanto and
Witasse, 1999; Aponte et al., 2005]. Neglecting diffusion,
the background, horizontal, neutral wind along the magnetic
meridian is Um  	Vap/cos(I). We overlay Um in Figure 3a.

We define Uk = 	UH to be in the positive wind direction.
As depicted in Figure 3b, Um and Uk are 2 independent
projections of the neutral wind along 2 different directions
in the horizontal plane. Using simple geometry, the com-
ponent of the wind perpendicular to Uk is

where x is the angle between Uk and Um. The angle of Uk
from north is F = 90 + q, so x  22 + F. U? and Uk are
shown in Figure 3c.

U2 Ã¾ V 2p , is shown in Figure 3e,
along with the angle of Vtot counterclockwise from north
north, cos	1(U/Vtot) 	 90. Although Vtot  150 m/s at z 
220 km, Vtot rapidly increases and decreases between z 
160â€“220 km, peaking at z  180 km with an amplitude of
250 m/s. The direction of Vtot at z  220 km is 40 west
of north, which is 10 east of Uk; thus, this GW was
propagating nearly opposite to the background, neutral
wind. This is expected in the F region, since GWs
propagating against the wind have larger wIr and lz than
GWs propagating with or perpendicular to the wind, thereby
penetrating to much higher altitudes before dissipating
[Vadas and Fritts, 2006].
7. Discussion and Conclusions
[17] In this paper, we studied a GW observed by the
PFISR on December 13, 2006, at 22â€“23:30 UT. jlzj
increased from jlzj  150 km at z  160 km to jlzj 
400 km at z  190 km, then decreased to jlzj  200 km at
z  220 km. Using a dissipative, GW anelastic dispersion
relation, we calculated the GWâ€™s intrinsic period, tIr(z). We
then calculated the projection of the neutral, background,
horizontal wind along the GW propagation direction, UH(z),
from z  160â€“240 km. We found that the calculated winds
at z  160 km and z  220 km are consistent with tidal
amplitudes, but are much larger at z  180â€“190 km: UH 
	250 m/s. We also used the mean component of the anti-
parallel ion velocity, Vap, to calculate the neutral wind along
the magnetic meridian, Um. We then demonstrated that the
total, horizontal neutral background wind from z  160â€“
240 km can be calculated from UH and Um using simple
geometry. However, Um may be inaccurate here because 1)
we neglected diffusion, which can be quite important, and 2)
Vlos may be biased at the lower altitudes because of the
range-smearing effects of the long pulse used for these
measurements. Future PFISR experiments with better range
resolution in this altitude regime may rectify this second
difficulty. Additionally, if two or more GWs are observed
simultaneously by PFISR and propagate in different direc-
tions, UH can be calculated separately for each GW using
Figure 3. (a) Measured mean ion velocity, Vap, multiplied

GW dissipative theory, so the zonal and meridional winds
can be computed via simple geometry without utilizing Vap.
[18] Although we only analyzed a single GW, we
demonstrated that this technique can be used to infer the
average, background, horizontal neutral wind. Neutral
winds are currently impossible to measure throughout the
F region. Ground-based F region neutral winds are typically
measured using Fabry-Perot interferometers during the
nighttime, which are sensitive to the Doppler shift of an
integrated emission layer and thus cannot measure vertical
wind profiles. ISR-measured velocities can only infer the
neutral wind component along the magnetic meridian as
discussed in Section 6. Global Circulation Models predict
that these thermospheric, neutral winds arise from semidi-
urnal and diurnal tides [e.g., Roble, 1995]. However, the
accuracy of the phases and amplitudes of these model winds
is uncertain.
[19] Application of this neutral wind extraction technique
may allow for a deeper understanding of the neutral and
plasma dynamics of the thermosphere. First, applying this
technique over several days at PFISR could be used to
determine the phases and amplitudes of semidiurnal and
diurnal tides. Work is currently under way to determine the
feasibility of extracting neutral winds on a near-continual or
routine basis. Second, it could be used to verify the
existence of spatially and temporally-localized neutral wind
accelerations, which have been predicted to occur when
GWs dissipate in the thermosphere [Vadas and Fritts,
2006]. Work is currently under way to compute the tempo-
ral variability of the extracted neutral winds. Finally, this
technique could be used to observe the neutral responses to
geomagnetic storms.
