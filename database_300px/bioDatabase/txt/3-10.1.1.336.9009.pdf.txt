Abstract
The SNAG repression domain is comprised of a highly
conserved 21–amino acid sequence, is named for its presence
in the Snail/growth factor independence-1 class of zinc finger
transcription factors, and is present in a variety of proto-
oncogenic transcription factors and developmental regula-
tors. The prototype SNAG domain containing oncogene,
growth factor independence-1, is responsible for the develop-
ment of T cell thymomas. The SNAIL proteins also encode the
SNAG domain and play key roles in epithelial mesenchymal
differentiation events during development and metastasis.
Significantly, these oncogenic functions require a functional
SNAG domain. The molecular mechanisms of SNAG domain–
mediated transcriptional repression are largely unknown.
Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy, we identified Ajuba, a
multiple LIM domain protein that can function as a
corepressor for the SNAG domain. Ajuba interacts with the
SNAG domain in vitro and in vivo , colocalizes with it, and
enhances SNAG-mediated transcriptional repression. Ajuba
shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and may form
a novel intracellular signaling system. Using an integrated
reporter gene combined with chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion, we observed rapid, SNAG-dependent assembly of a
multiprotein complex that included Ajuba, SNAG, and histone
modifications consistent with the repressed state. Thus, SNAG
domain proteins may bind Ajuba, trapping it in the nucleus
where it functions as an adapter or molecular scaffold for the
assembly of macromolecular repression complexes at target
promoters. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9097–106]
Introduction
Transcription factors are modular in architecture, often encod-
ing sequence-specific DNA binding and functionally separable
effector domains. The Cys2-His2 (C2H2) type zinc finger proteins
(ZFP) constitute the largest family of transcription factors in the
human proteome (1). The ZFPs can be classified into distinct
subfamilies such as SNAG-, KRAB-, BTB/POZ-, and SCAN-ZFPs
based on these highly conserved functional domains often encoded
in their NH2 termini. The mechanisms used by these domains
during transcriptional regulation include: (a) direct interaction
with the components of the basal transcription machinery, (b)
ATP-dependent remodeling of chromatin, and (c) site-specific
modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation,
and ubiquitination of the nucleosomal histones, which serve as
biochemical codes in the context of complex chromatin structure
(2). A widely accepted paradigm is that histone acetylation leads to
gene activation, whereas histone deacetylation results in repres-
sion. Importantly, many repressors function through corepressor
molecules as exemplified by DR-DRAP-1 (3), WRPW-Groucho (4),
REST-Co-REST (5), and KRAB–KRAB-associated protein-1 (KAP-1;
ref. 6).
The SNAG repression domain (Snail/GFI-1) is present in the
vertebrate homologues of the Snail/Slug and in the growth factor
independence-1 (GFI-1) ZFPs (7–10). The GFI-1 proto-oncogene
was cloned by using an insertional mutagenesis strategy wherein
Moloney murine leukemia virus–infected T cells selected for
interleukin 2 independence showed non–random integration of
the provirus at the GFI-1 locus (11). Remarkably, GFI-1 was
independently cloned as a gene, which could cooperate with myc
and pim1 in transgenic models of B- and T-cell lymphoma (12).
GFI-1 is a nuclear localized ZFP which recognizes a 12 bp DNA
consensus sequence (13, 14). The GFI-1 ZFP encodes the 20–amino
acid SNAG domain in its NH2 terminus. This segment is sufficient
for repression, and single amino acid substitutions in the SNAG
domain abolish repression (10). Consistent with its role as a T cell–
tropic oncogene, overexpression of GFI-1 in immortalized T cells
allowed them to escape the G1 arrest induced by interleukin 2
withdrawal and, interestingly, a SNAG domain mutant of GFI-1
was inactive in this capacity (10). Gene knockout studies have
shown that mammalian GFI-1 genes are essential for the develop-
ment of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages as well as neutro-
phil differentiation (15–17).
The vertebrate homologues of the fly Snail and Slug genes
encode SNAG domains and their roles in development and disease
have been extensively studied (18). In Xenopus , the Snail/Slug
family has been shown to play essential roles in both mesoderm
differentiation and in neural crest induction/migration, and these
functions require a competent SNAG domain. Both fibroblast
growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor induce expression of
Slug, which in turn, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transitions
(19). The E2A-HLF fusion protein has been shown to activate the
human Slug gene with resultant interleukin-3–independent survival
and transformation of pro–B cells (20). Snail family members also
play crucial roles in the development of mesoderm and nervous
system by triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Recent
studies have shown that the human and mouse E-cadherin
promoters are direct targets for Snail ZFPs and the loss of
E-cadherin expression is a major contributor to the acquisition of

an invasive, highly malignant phenotype during human tumor
progression (21, 22). Thus, it is clear that the SNAG-ZFPs play
important and diverse roles in embryonic development and in
human disease. Despite these advances in defining the roles of
SNAG domain proteins in biological processes, the molecular
mechanisms of SNAG-mediated transcriptional repression are still
largely undefined.
In this article, we identify Ajuba (23, 24) and LIMD1 (25) proteins
as SNAG domain–interacting proteins and provide strong evidence
that they function as corepressors for the SNAG domain.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and antibodies. COS-1, NIH3T3, and its stable cell line
derivatives (SPHL11 and SPHL20) were grown as described (26). The
a-PAX3 (27) and a-LEXA IgGs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) are rabbit and
goat polyclonal antibodies which recognize the PAX3 and LEXA DNA-
binding domains, respectively. The a-Ajuba and a-LIMD1 are polyclonal
antibodies raised by immunizing rabbits with 6-His fusion proteins of
mouse Ajuba (amino acids 1–216) and mouse LIMD1 (amino acids 1–158)
as antigens. These antibodies only recognize their cognate antigens and do
not cross-react in the assays tested. The a-MYC tag monoclonal antibody
(clone 9E10), a-AcH3, a-AcH4 (raised against acetylated histone H3 and
H4), and a-H3-MeK9 (raised against trimethylated lysine 9, histone H3)
antibodies were purchased from Upstate.
Construction of a SNAG domain minigene and its derivatives. A
synthetic SNAG domain coding sequence derived from GFI-1 was
constructed by standard overlap-extension PCR. A Kozak consensus was
added prior to the initiator methionine of the 20–amino acid SNAG domain
(MPRSFLVKSKKAHSYHQPRS) followed by a 6–amino acid spacer
(PGPDYS). In-frame EcoRI (5¶) and SalI (3¶) sites were included for cloning
into the pSP73 vector. Alanine substitution mutagenesis was done via PCR
using appropriate mutant oligonucleotides. The wild-type and mutant
SNAG minigenes were subcloned into PAX3-, LEXA-, and pBTM116-LEXA
containing plasmids to create NH2 terminal fusions.
Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
Each expression plasmid was verified for stable protein expression in vivo as
previously described (26). The myc-AJUBA and LIMD1 plasmids have also
been described (23). Briefly, [35S]-L-methionine–labeled whole cell extracts
prepared from transiently transfected COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated
with a-PAX3 IgG or a-LEXA IgG, and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and fluorography. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, subsequent to
cotransfection of either SNAG-PAX3 or SNAG-LEXA with the MYC-Ajuba
plasmid (1:1 ratio), immunoprecipitation was carried out using ELB buffer
(28). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a rapid protocol (27) and used
in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a 32P-labeled e5 site (a PAX3-
binding site derived from the engrailed gene) probe.
Transcriptional repression assays. To monitor the repression poten-
tials of the chimeric SNAG repressor proteins, 2  105 NIH3T3 cells were
transfected with 1 Ag of the expression plasmid along with 0.5 Ag of PAX3-
or LEXA-luciferase reporter plasmids, and 0.25 Ag of pCMV-LacZ plasmids,
using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). Whole cell extracts were assayed
for luciferase activities and then normalized to h-galactosidase values for
transfection efficiency (26, 27). Fold repression was determined as the ratio
of normalized light units in vector versus SNAG-expression plasmid–
transfected cells. To examine the effect of Ajuba on SNAG-PAX3 or SNAG-
LEXA–mediated repression, cotransfection was done as described above.
Immunofluorescence and colocalization. Immunocytochemistry was
done essentially as previously described (28). NIH3T3 cells were transfected
with the indicated expression plasmids. The cells were fixed, permeabilized,
and then incubated with a-LEXA (1:100 dilution) or a-MYC (1:1,000
dilution) antibodies. The proteins were detected with FITC-conjugated
a-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution) or Texas red–conjugated a-mouse IgG (1:1,000
dilution), respectively. Finally, the cells were stained for DNA with Hoechst
(2 ng/mL) and mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount G (Southern
Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Cells were visualized using a Leica confocal
laser-scanning microscope with the help of the Wistar Institute Cancer
Center Microscopy Core Facility. Images were captured using QED Imaging
software.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. SPHL11 or SPHL20 cells were plated
at 5  106 cells/150 mm dish, treated continuously with either 500 nmol/L
of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; +OHT dishes) or 0.1% ethanol (OHT
dishes) for 2 days, and then fixed in 1% formaldehyde (EM Biosciences) for
20 min at 37jC. Solubilized and sonicated chromatin was prepared as
previously described (29), and immunoprecipitated with a-PAX3, a-Ajuba,
a-LIMD1, a-AcH3, a-AcH4, or a-H3-MeK9 antibodies. Usually, 10% of the
clarified chromatin was saved as input. The immunocomplexes were
processed as previously described (29). Both the input and the immuno-
precipitated DNAs were used in quantitative PCR reactions with the primer
pairs illustrated in Fig. 5A . The PBS1 (5¶ GATCGATAATTCGAGCTACTG 3¶)
and PBS2 (5¶ GAGCTCGGTACCCGGGTCG 3¶) primer pair amplify the PAX3
binding sites; the primer pair TKP1 (5¶ GCGCGGTCCCAGGTCCACTT 3¶)
and LUC1 (5¶ TCCAGGAACCAGGGCGTATCTCT 3¶) amplify the HSV-TK
promoter region (26). The DNA fragments were electrophoresed on 1.5%
agarose gels and either photographed or subjected to Southern blotting and
autoradiography.
Results
Characterization of engineered SNAG repressors. The SNAG
transcription factor superfamily includes Snail, Slug, GFI-1, Scratch,
and IA-1 ZFPs. In spite of possessing a varied number of C2H2-type
zinc fingers at their COOH-termini, they all contain the highly
conserved NH2-terminal SNAG repression domain (Fig. 1A).
Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal W indicates that the
SNAG domain homology extends to f20 amino acids with the
NH2-terminal first seven amino acids being strictly conserved
between the different members (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the SNAG
domains of GFI-1 and GFI-1B genes also possess a well-conserved
nuclear localization signal (KSKK). To determine if the synthetic
SNAG domain would function as a transferable, modular repression
domain, we fused it to the NH2 terminus of the minimal PAX3
DNA-binding domain (PAX3; Fig. 1C). We have used PAX3 as a
recipient (26, 27, 30) for the following reasons: PAX3 (a) binds
DNA as a monomer and recognizes an extended nondegenerate
DNA binding site due to paired and homeodomain-DNA binding
motifs, (b) is easily detectable using PAX3 antibodies, and (c) is
transcriptionally neutral when bound to DNA in the absence of an
effector domain. We used alanine scanning mutagenesis to map
the amino acid sequence requirements for SNAG repression. We
targeted both the NH2 terminal block of seven amino acids, which
is identical among all SNAG domains and the more COOH-terminal
region, which is not as highly conserved (Fig. 1C). Each protein was
comparably expressed (Fig. 1D) and showed comparable DNA
binding activity to the e5 site (Fig. 1E). Expression plasmids
encoding SNAG-PAX3 fusions were cotransfected with the PAX3-
luciferase reporter plasmid and cell extracts assayed for activity.
Fusion of the SNAG domain to the NH2-terminus of PAX3 created a
potent repressor (Fig. 1F). Repression was dose-dependent and was
strictly contingent on PAX3-binding sites in the reporter plasmid
(data not shown). The mutants varied in their abilities to repress
the PAX3-luciferase in reporter assays (Fig. 1F). The FLV-AAA
substitution severely reduced repression. However, the S-A and KK-
AA mutants retained significant repression activity, whereas the
single substitution F-A severely reduced repression. Thus, a
phenylalanine to alanine substitution in the highly conserved
SNAG domain converts a normally powerful repressor of
transcription into a neutral DNA binding protein. Whether the
seven–amino acid NH2 terminal segment is sufficient for repression

remains to be tested. Interestingly, a modular repression domain
as small as four amino acids (WRPW) present in the hairy and
achaete-scute bHLH transcription factors is sufficient to confer
repression by recruiting the Groucho corepressor (4). We suggest
that the SNAG domain may function in a similar manner.
A yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify SNAG domain–
associated proteins. Because direct protein-protein interactions
might be required for SNAG-mediated repression, we screened
for such proteins using yeast two-hybrid methods. The 20–amino
acid SNAG domain was used as bait by fusing the SNAG domain
(wild-type and mutants) to the NH2-terminus of LEXA (Fig. 2A). To
guard against spatial constraints to protein binding, we included a
17–amino acid, inert spacer between the SNAG domain and the
NH2 terminus of LEXA. The SNAG-LEXA fusions were properly
expressed in mammalian cells (Fig. 2A), exhibited proper binding
to a LEXA DNA-binding site in gel shift assays (data not shown),
and repressed the LEXA-luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 2A). Thus,
this spectrum of ‘‘baits’’ formed the important set of reagents
with which to identify and distinguish true mediators of SNAG
repression.
First, we showed that the pBTM116-SNAG-LEXA constructs
neither activated nor repressed transcription in yeast (data not
shown). The wild-type SNAG-LEXA fusion was then cotransformed
with a murine embryonic (E9-E11) library constructed in pVP16
and scored for histidine prototrophy and LacZ activity in a
standard two-hybrid screen (31). From f200 primary hits that
were obtained upon screening, f40 million library clones, we
isolated f20 that interacted strongly with the wild-type SNAG
domain. Several of these were re-screened by reintroduction into
naı¨ve yeast with a variety of other baits. SNAG domain–associated
proteins, SNAP13 and SNAP20, interacted very strongly with
wild-type SNAG but failed to interact with the SNAG (FLV-AAA)
mutant, LEXA, or any of the other negative control baits including
KAP-1, Lamin, Rho, and protein kinase C (Fig. 2B). We further

characterized SNAP13 and SNAP20 by introducing them into
naı¨ve yeast along with each of the pBTM116-SNAG-LEXA baits
(Fig. 2C). The interactions were almost completely concordant
with repression activity; each SNAP interacted with active SNAG
repressors (wild-type and S-A mutants) but did not interact with
the mutants (FLV-AAA and F-A), which abolish repression. The
exception to this concordance is KK-AA, which is expressed at a
much-reduced level in yeast (data not shown). Thus, by these
criteria, these SNAPS are strong candidates for mediators of
SNAG function.
The DNA sequence of the SNAPs showed that the proteins
were in-frame with the VP16 activation domain encoded by the
vector. In the primary screen, we obtained two independent
isolates of SNAP13 and multiple, identical isolates of SNAP20.
BLAST searches revealed that SNAP13 and SNAP20 were identical
to the two NH2-terminal LIM domains of Ajuba and LIMD1,
respectively. LIM is an acronym of three transcription factors,
Lin11, Isl-1, and Mec-3, in which the motif was first identified (32).
The LIM domain protein subfamily, which includes Ajuba and
LIMD1, is illustrated in Fig. 2D . The Ajuba, LIMD1, and three
other LIM domain proteins such as Zyxin, TRIP6, and lipoma-
preferred partner proteins contain characteristic glycine/proline-
rich regions and nuclear export signals. They belong to the group
3 LIM domain family, the members of which exhibit nucleocyto-
plasmic distribution and mediate both cellular and nuclear
signaling events (33). LIM domains are bona fide protein-protein
interaction motifs, which encode a signature Cys2-His1-Cys3-Cys
Zn2+ binding domain as shown for the three individual LIM
domains of Ajuba (Fig. 2E). A dendrogram analysis constructed
from the LIM domains of the three LIM domain proteins revealed
that a distinct phylogenetic relationship exists only between the
LIM domains of Ajuba and LIMD1 (Fig. 2F). The SNAG-interacting
LIM domains of Ajuba and LIMD1 (f134 amino acids) fell into
a single group with a similarity index of 62.7, implying that they
evolved from a common ancestral gene.
Ajuba interacts with SNAG in vivo and functions as a
corepressor. To verify that SNAG-LIM domain interactions occur
in vivo in mammalian cells, we used expression vectors for SNAG-
PAX3, SNAG-LEXA, and MYC epitope–tagged, full-length Ajuba
(MYC-Ajuba). Proper expression of the MYC-Ajuba protein was
confirmed by immunoprecipitation with a-MYC monoclonal
antibody (data not shown). Next, we cotransfected the MYC-Ajuba
and wild-type or mutant SNAG-LEXA plasmids into COS-1 cells.
The 35S-methionine-labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
with either a-MYC or a-LEXA IgG. Figure 3A shows that the
a-MYC detects a 66 kDa MYC-Ajuba protein whereas the a-LEXA
detects a 25 kDa LEXA protein in the MYC-Ajuba + LEXA vector
cotransfected cells. However, in the wild-type SNAG-LEXA + MYC-
Ajuba cotransfected cells, the a-LEXA also detects the MYC-Ajuba
protein. As expected, the a-MYC also detects the wild-type SNAG-
LEXA protein. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with mutant
SNAG-LEXA plasmids indicated that the repression-incompetent

mutants of the SNAG domain fail to bind the Ajuba, strongly
suggesting that this interaction is functionally relevant (Fig. 3A).
To confirm that the region of Ajuba required for SNAG
interaction contained the LIM domain, we used the expression
plasmids coding for the NH2- or COOH-terminal segments of Ajuba
(defined as ‘‘Ajuba-preLIM’’ or ‘‘Ajuba-LIM’’; ref. 23) in cotransfec-
tion experiments along with the SNAG-PAX3 plasmid. The
SNAG-PAX3 protein coprecipitated with the Ajuba protein or the
Ajuba-LIM domain but not the Ajuba-preLIM domain, suggesting
that the LIM region of Ajuba is the site of SNAG domain interaction
(data not shown). Thus, Ajuba-SNAG-PAX3 complexes are very
efficiently formed in vivo following cotransfection and are stable
to moderate salt, detergent extraction procedures. Importantly,
this coprecipitation was not detected when a PAX3 protein that
lacks a SNAG domain was used, confirming that a SNAG-Ajuba
interaction is occurring (data not shown).
We did cotransfection experiments to determine if Ajuba could
modify the transcriptional repression function of the SNAG
domain. We transfected CMV vectors for SNAG-PAX3 or SNAG-
LEXA constructs into NIH3T3 cells, with or without CMV-Ajuba.
SNAG-LEXA repressed the LEXA-luciferase reporter, and this
repression was enhanced by CMV-Ajuba. As expected, Ajuba also
enhanced SNAG-PAX3–mediated repression of the PAX3 luciferase
reporter (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Ajuba mediates SNAG
repression and functions as a SNAG corepressor.
Recruitment and nuclear colocalization of Ajuba and SNAG
in NIH3T3 cells. The functional studies prompted us to investigate
the subcellular localization patterns of the MYC-Ajuba, the wild-
type and mutant SNAG-LEXA proteins. Immunofluorescence
analysis revealed that cells transfected with MYC-Ajuba showed
predominant cytoplasmic staining and those that were transfected
with SNAG-LEXA (wild-type and mutants) showed intense nuclear
staining (Fig. 4A). However, cells that received both Ajuba and
SNAG-LEXA plasmids showed abundant nuclear staining of
Ajuba that was solely dependent on the repression competency
of the SNAG domain (Fig. 4B). A majority of cells in this doubly
transfected population showed the pattern observed in Fig. 4B .
These remarkable images strongly corroborate our functional
studies described earlier. These results also suggest that the SNAG
domain can recruit and/or retain Ajuba in the nucleus, and are

consistent with our earlier observations that Ajuba is both cyto-
plasmic and nuclear. Recent reports suggest that group 3 LIM
proteins like Zyxin and Ajuba can shuttle between the cytoplasm
and the nucleus, and thus, may form a novel intracellular signaling
system. It has been hypothesized that there are nuclear ‘‘anchors’’
for this class of shuttling LIM proteins (34). We hypothesize and
present evidence that the SNAG domain may be such an anchor for
the Ajuba protein.
Molecular components of SNAG repression are recruited to
the target promoter. We investigated whether the SNAG domain–
mediated transcriptional repression involves chromatin modifica-
tion by using trichostatin A (TSA) and by performing chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We generated stable cell lines,
which contained a chromatin-integrated PAX3-luciferase reporter
transgenes and a conditional SNAG repressor SNAG-PAX3-HBD
wherein the SNAG-PAX3 is fused to the estrogen receptor
hormone-binding domain (SPHBD; Fig. 5A). This system has been
extensively used by this laboratory (26, 27). We tested multiple cell
lines for protein expression and hormone-dependent (4-OHT)
repression of the PAX3-luciferase reporter (26). We chose the
SPHL11 and SPHL20 cell clones to study due to their repression
potentials. In the presence of 4-OHT, f6-fold repression was
observed (26); however, in the presence of both 4-OHT and TSA,
this repression was totally relieved in both clones (26). This
experiment suggests that one of the mechanisms of SNAG domain
repression may involve histone deacetylation. To confirm that the
SNAG-Ajuba machinery was recruited to the target gene, we did
comprehensive ChIP experiments using a battery of antibodies:
chromatin-associated proteins were cross-linked to DNA in vivo
with formaldehyde in mock or 4-OHT–treated SPHL11 and SPHL20
cells and immunoprecipitated with a-PAX3, a-Ajuba, a-LIMD1,
a-AcH3, a-AcH4, and a-H3-MeK9 antibodies. The immunoprecipi-
tated DNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR, using primer pair
targeting the 6xPAX3 binding sites (PBS1 and PBS2), the TK
promoter regions (TKP1 and LUC1) or the CD19-TK-LUC zeocinR
locus (26). Fragments, which bracket the PAX3-binding sites, were
considerably enriched in the PAX3 immunoprecipitates after
4-OHT treatment, indicating that there was a strong enrichment
of the SPHBD protein at the PAX3 sites. This experiment was
controlled by the presence of similar levels of the PAX3 binding site
fragment in the input chromatin (Fig. 5B). Likewise, we observed a
strong 4-OHT–dependent enrichment of the 257 bp TK promoter

fragment in a-Ajuba, a-LIMD1, and a-H3-MeK9 chromatin
immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5C). Thus, in addition to the DNA-
binding component, other components of the SNAG repression
complex (i.e., Ajuba, LIMD1, and H3-MeK9) were inducibly
recruited to the target gene. Based on these results, we conclude
that the SPHBD fusion protein, Ajuba, LIMD1, and H3-MeK9 are
strongly recruited to the chromatin regions comprising the PAX3
binding site, and the TK promoter region, respectively.
In parallel ChIP experiments, we observed a significant reduction
in the levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 at the TK promoter
region following 4-OHT-treatment, indicating that histone hypo-
acetylation occurs upon recruitment of SPHBD protein to the
upstream PAX3 sites (Fig. 5D). These results are in agreement with
the repression of this locus by SPHBD following hormone
treatment. Future ChIP experiments will unravel the identity of
the enzymes involved in SNAG repression. We expect these experi-
ments to yield clues about the nature of the unique nucleocyto-
plasmic signaling mechanism used by Ajuba and LIMD1 proteins.
Discussion
Mammalian zinc finger transcription factors play vital roles
during organism development and subsequent homeostasis. In
order to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of SNAG-
mediated repression that are responsible for the biological func-
tions of SNAG-ZFPs, we isolated and characterized SNAG-specific
corepressors. The highly modular nature of SNAG and other repres-
sion domains such as KRAB and BTB/POZ has greatly aided the
discovery of their mechanisms of action (6, 35–38). We followed
this approach in our earlier studies to understand the mechanistic
details of the KRAB-mediated repression by isolating and charac-
terizing the KAP-1 corepressor (6, 28). In this study, we have iden-
tified Ajuba and LIMD1 proteins as downstream players in the
SNAG repression pathway.
After the initial identification of LIM domain proteins, Ajuba
and LIMD1, as SNAG-domain interactors in the yeast two-hybrid
assay, we did extensive biochemical analyses to confirm this
interaction. Our striking results from coimmunoprecipitation
experiments indicate that the SNAG domain interacts avidly with
Ajuba in vivo and also that Ajuba can enhance SNAG-mediated
repression. As expected, we observed these results only with
repression-competent SNAG domains. The KAP-1 corepressor,
which interacts only with repression-competent KRAB domains,
also enhance KRAB-mediated repression. Because Ajuba possesses
these important characteristics of corepressor proteins similar to
KAP-1, we designate Ajuba as a SNAG corepressor.
LIM domain interactions have been observed in several classes
of transcription factors and cofactors. Specific examples include:
(a) the nuclear LIM-only (LMO) protein interact with GATA-1,
GATA-2, and Tal1/Scl transcription factors (39); (b) the LIM
domain–binding protein Ldb1, its LIM-only protein partner LMO2,
and the DNA-binding SCL/E12, exist in a multiprotein complex
that negatively regulates erythroid function (40); (c) FHL2/DRAL
interacts with the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein
(a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor) and functions as a
corepressor by augmenting promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger–
mediated transcriptional repression (41); (d) FHL2 associates with
Jun and Fos and serves as a coactivator of activator protein by
stimulating Fos- and Jun-dependent transcription (42); (e) the
CLIM forms a protein complex consisting of LIM-HD, LMO, bHLH,
and GATA at the target promoters (43); ( f ) the LIM-homeodomain
transcription factor Lhx3 binds to the pituitary-specific transcrip-
tion factor Pitx-1 and also interacts with several coactivator/
adapter proteins including the selective LIM-binding protein (44);
and (g ) cysteine-rich LIM-only proteins (CRP1 and CRP2) play
important roles in organizing multiprotein complexes, both in the
cytoplasm, where they participate in cytoskeletal remodeling, and
in the nucleus, where they strongly facilitate smooth muscle
differentiation (45). These studies clearly show that nuclear LIM
proteins can function as adapter molecules in the formation of
large multiprotein complexes that form on DNA and that influence
transcription.
Our colocalization studies show that Ajuba by itself remains
totally cytoplasmic, however, in the presence of a repression-
competent SNAG domain, its localization completely shifted to the
nucleus. The SNAG domain may facilitate both the import of Ajuba
into the nucleus and its subsequent retention by serving as a
nuclear anchor in chromatin. Similar nuclear targeting functions
have been observed for other LIM proteins. For example, (a)
stimulation of the Rho signaling pathway induces translocation of
the transcriptional LIM-only coactivator FHL2 to the nucleus (46);
(b) in heart, FHL2 interacts with hNP220, a DNA-binding nuclear
protein to serve as a molecular adapter in the formation of a
multiprotein complex (47); (c) the LIM protein KyoT2, an
alternatively spliced murine isoform of SLIM1 has been shown to
negatively regulate transcription by interacting with RBP-J DNA-
binding protein and displacing it from the DNA (48, 49); (d)
interaction of Zyxin (usually found in focal adhesions) with the
human papillomavirus–derived E6 protein leads to its accumula-
tion in the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional activator.
Significantly, this interaction requires the three LIM domains
present at the COOH terminus of Zyxin (50); and (e) the lipoma-
preferred partner protein exhibits nucleocytoplasmic distribution
and possesses focal adhesion and nuclear targeting capabilities.
It does not contain any consensus nuclear localization signals
suggesting that it may be imported into the nucleus via a nuclear
localization signal containing transport protein (51).
The colocalization studies also suggested that upon SNAG-
mediated translocation, Ajuba along with its (unidentified)
associated proteins could constitute a macromolecular repression
complex at the target promoter. Based on our findings from the
ChIP experiments, we favor the notion that the initial DNA-binding
by the SNAG-PAX3 repressor at the PAX3 binding sites leads to the
subsequent recruitment of Ajuba, and associated proteins to the
promoter region. Because we also observed significant hypoacety-
lation of histone tails at the promoter region and reversal of
SNAG-mediated repression in the presence of TSA, we believe that
SNAG repression involves histone deacetylases (HDAC) and that
HDAC may be constituents in the SNAG-holo repression complex.
HDAC and Sin3A have been found in SNAIL complexes, which
repress E-cadherin (52). However, our preliminary data suggests
that arginine methyltransferases also play an important role.5
It is well established that HDACs can be found in both the
cytoplasm and the nucleus. Ajuba may interact with a cytosolic
HDAC and recruit it to the nucleus, or it may interact with an
HDAC1 existing in the nucleus and recruit it to the repression
complex. The RLIM has been shown to interact with members of
the HDAC corepressor complex (53). It would be interesting to
identify the nature of the HDAC involved, and to decipher the
5 Z. Hou et al., unpublished data.

hitherto unidentified associated proteins that constitute the
macromolecular repressor complex. This necessitates the isolation
and characterization of interacting proteins that are present in
both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, experiments which
are ongoing. These findings provide another example whereby a
small conserved repression domain, the 21–amino acid (SNAG)
functions by recruiting a large macromolecular complex. These
results are particularly relevant to the SNAIL-SNAG proteins which
are up-regulated during the processes of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and metastases in many epithelial cancers. A small
molecule strategy to block the SNAIL-SNAG-Ajuba interaction may
be a feasible and attractive target to provide either preventive or
therapeutic efficacy during tumor progression.
