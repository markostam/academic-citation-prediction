[1] We present a physical model to calculate production of cosmogenic isotope 7Be in the
atmosphere. The model is based on a full Monte Carlo simulation of an electromagnetic-
muon-nucleonic cascade in the atmosphere, using CORSIKA and FLUKA packages.
The present results are in broad agreement with earlier empirical and semiempirical models
but predict higher production rate than some recent theoretical models. A comparison to
direct and indirect measurements of the 7Be production rate in the atmosphere
confirms the validity of the model in the whole range of geographical latitudes and
altitudes. Results of the full Monte Carlo simulation are tabulated in a form of the
yield function. These tables are given together with a detailed recipe, which allows a
user to compute easily the isotope production for given location, altitude, and the
spectrum of cosmic rays. An effect of a severe solar energetic particle event of January
2005 is estimated, providing a new tool for tracing of mass transport.

1. Introduction
[2] Cosmogenic isotopes with a relatively short lifetime
have been long recognized as useful tools to study atmo-
spheric transport of air masses [e.g., Lal and Peters, 1962;
Raisbeck et al., 1981]. Particularly suitable for this purpose
is the cosmogenic isotope 7Be (the half-life time of
53.6 days), which is produced through interactions of
atmospheric O and N nuclei and the nucleonic component
of the atmospheric cascade induced by galactic cosmic rays
(GCR) [see, e.g., Dorman, 2004, chapter 10.6]. Shortly after
formation 7Be atoms become attached to atmospheric aero-
sols and thus their fate is related to the aerosol transport.
Therefore, 7Be appears to be an excellent tracer for the
atmospheric circulation, and is often used to constraint
atmospheric circulation models [e.g., Koch et al., 1996;
Liu et al., 2001; Jordan et al., 2003], when the data on
measurements of the isotope concentration in stratospheric
or tropospheric air is confronted with predictions of modern
sophisticated 3-D models of the air mass transport.
[3] For this purpose one needs to know precisely features
of its production in the atmosphere, including altitude and
latitude profiles. A number of models have been developed
to compute the 7Be production in the atmosphere, as
presented in Table 1. The first consistent model was
developed by D. Lal and coworkers [Bhandari et al.,
1966; Lal and Peters, 1967; Lal and Suess, 1968], called
henceforth LP67. The LP67 model uses an empirical
approach based on fitting simplified model calculations to
measurements of the isotope concentrations and ‘‘star’’
(inelastic nuclear collisions) formations in the atmosphere.
Accordingly, the LP67 model yields the best agreement
with measurements of stratospheric 7Be (see discussion by
Liu et al. [2001]). Next was an analytical model by O’Brien
[1979] (hereinafter referred to as OB79), who solved the
problem of GCR-induced cascade in the atmosphere using
an analytical stationary approximation in the form of
Boltzman equation, which has been also normalized per
‘‘star’’ formation. Those models were based on calculating
the rate of inelastic collisions or ‘‘stars’’ and then applied
the mean spallation yield per ‘‘star.’’ This approach has
been further developed by Nagai et al. [2000] (called N00
henceforth) who calculated the isotope production using
secondary neutron spectra obtained by Armstrong et al.
[1973] for the solar activity minimum conditions, and recent
cross sections instead of the mean yield of a ‘‘star.’’ The
N00 model is semiempirical and contains essential simpli-
fications; for example, its proton spectrum was obtained by
scaling from neutron spectra and applied in the same shape
to all depths. Moreover, it is valid only for the solar
minimum conditions. A new step in modeling of the isotope
production has been made by Masarik and Beer [1999]
(hereinafter referred to as MB99), who performed a full
Monte Carlo simulation of the GCR-initiated cascade of the
atmosphere and directly used cross sections of spallation
reactions instead of the average ‘‘star’’ efficiency. Since
Masarik and Beer [1999] were interested in the total
production rather than in its altitude profile, they used an
approximation of the flat atmosphere. The models described
above compute isotope production by galactic cosmic rays
and do not consider production by solar energetic particles
(SEP). A recent model by Webber and Higbie [2003] and

Webber et al. [2007] (hereinafter referred to as WH03/07) is
also based on a full Monte Carlo simulation of the atmo-
spheric cascade. The WH03/07 model uses improved cross
sections and is advanced with respect to MB99 in the sense
that it first computes the yield function (see section 2.4) for
a fixed energy of GCR. This approach allows much more
flexibility with the model application, in particular comput-
ing an effect of SEP, whose energy spectrum is totally
different from that of GCR (see section 4). However, the
WH03/07 model is simplified in the sense that it assumes a
flat atmosphere and a vertical beam of primary GCR
particles. With little effect on the total 7Be production, this
assumption is crucial for the results in the stratosphere.
Main properties of the earlier models have been summarized
in Table 1. It is important to mention that most of the earlier
models do not provide information on the altitudinal pro-
files of the isotope production and are not able to deal with
the effect of solar energetic particles, which, as argued in
section 4, can be quite important for a severe SEP event.
[4] Accordingly, there is a need for a calibrated model
that is able to compute a full 3-D pattern of the 7Be
production in the atmosphere, including detailed simulation
of the SEP effect. Here we present such a model, which can
compute production of 7Be isotope in the atmosphere,
including altitude and geographical profiles. Flexibility of
the model allows a direct computation of the effect of SEP
or other transient events. A special emphasis is given to
comparison of the present model results with direct and
indirect measurements and with other models. We provide a
full numerical recipe so that everyone interested can com-
pute the 7Be production in any prescribed solar and geo-
physical conditions.
2. Modeling the Isotope Production in the
Atmosphere
2.1. Monte Carlo Simulations of the Atmospheric
Cascade
[5] The isotope 7Be is produced in the atmosphere mainly
as a result of spallation of oxygen and nitrogen by energetic
protons, neutrons and a nuclei. These energetic particles
can be either primary cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere
or secondary nucleonic components of the cascade initiated
by interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere. We have
modeled development of the atmospheric cascade by means
of a Monte Carlo simulation tool CORSIKA (Cosmic Ray
Simulations for Kascade, version 6.617, August 2007)
[Heck et al., 1998]. Interactions between low-energy (below
80 GeV of total energy) hadrons were treated with the
FLUKA tool (version 2006.3b, March 2007) [Fasso` et al.,
2001]. We used a realistic curved atmosphere, in contrast to
flat atmospheres used in most earlier models, also allowing
for upward moving secondary particles. Using the curved
atmosphere is important for the stratosphere. The chemical
composition of the atmosphere was taken as N2, O2 and Ar
in the volume fractions of 78.1%, 21% and 0.9%, respec-
tively. The atmosphere’s density profile was modeled
according to the standard U.S. atmosphere parameterized
by Keilhauer et al. [2004].
[6] The flux of primary cosmic rays corresponding to
their CR intensity with isotropic angular distribution, J
given in (cm2 s sr GeV)1, has been modeled as follows.
The corresponding particle flux, F in (cm2 s GeV)1,
impinging on the top of the atmosphere is defined as [see,
e.g., Grieder, 2001, equation (1.35)]
F ¼ 2p
Z 1
0
J cos q d cos qð Þ; ð1Þ
where q is the incident zenith angle. We note that the unit
flux, i.e., F = 1, corresponds to the CR intensity J = 1/p.
Therefore, the distribution (over the zenith angle q) of the
primary CR particles impinging on the atmosphere is
proportional to cos q:
dF
d cos q
¼ 2 cos q; ð2Þ
for the unit flux. Accordingly, when simulating the cascade,
we threw primary CR particles with a fixed kinetic energy
on the top of the atmosphere with the zenith angle
distribution proportional to cosine of the zenith angle
(equation (2)) and with the even azimuthal distribution.
Cascade simulations have been done separately for two

types of primary cosmic rays, protons and a particles. The
number of simulated cascades N was chosen depending on
the energy of primary CR particle Eo so that the statistical
uncertainty of the final result is below 1%, which is much
better than uncertainties in the used cross sections. We have
performed 3  106 cascade simulation runs for each fixed
value of Eo below 1 GeV/nucleon, 10
6 runs for 1  Eo <
10 GeV/nucleon, 3  105 runs for 10  Eo < 100 GeV/
nucleon, and 105 runs for higher energies.
[7] For each cascade simulation we have fixed all the
secondary and primary particles of the following types
(protons p, neutrons n and a particles) that cross a fixed
observation level h in the atmosphere. For each such
particle we have recorded three components of its momen-
tum, Px, Py, Pz, in the Cartesian coordinate system with the z
axis pointing to nadir. Then the angle y between the nadir
and the direction of the particle’s momentum is defined as

[8] This information has been collected over all simula-
tion runs with a given energy Eo of primary CR particles
and for fixed atmospheric depth h, and used in forthcoming
computations.
2.2. Isotope Production Function
[9] Since the development of atmospheric cascade is
defined mostly by the amount of matter traversed, we
express altitude in units of the atmospheric depth, i.e., the
amount of the atmospheric matter in g/cm2 overburden at a
given level in the atmosphere. It is directly related to the
barometric pressure so that the sea level (1013 mbar
barometric pressure) corresponds to the atmospheric depth
of 1033 g/cm2. Average (per one primary particle of type A
with energy Eo) production of
7Be, in units of atoms g1
cm2, at the atmospheric depth h can be defined as a sum of
productions by all secondaries

where N(Eo) is the number of the simulated cascades with

secondary protons, neutrons and a particles, respectively,

where sxY is the cross section of
7Be production by particle

1022 g1 are the numbers of oxygen and nitrogen nuclei,
respectively, in gram of air. Cross sections have been
adopted from Lange et al. [1994], Tatischeff et al. [2006],
Webber and Higbie [2003], and Webber et al. [2007]. The
resultant efficiency curves are shown in Figure 1.
2.3. Production in the Upper Atmosphere
[10] The CORSIKA code is not well suited for simula-
tions of the upper atmosphere (h  10 g/cm2) before the
first nuclear interaction. Therefore, we have also performed
an analytical calculation of the 7Be production in the upper
10 g/cm2 atmospheric layer, using a thin target approxima-
tion. In this thin layer, secondaries can be neglected, and the
isotope is produced by reactions between primary CR
particles and the target nuclei. Let us consider a primary
proton with energy Eo penetrating to the atmosphere at
zenith angle q. We neglect elastic scattering and assume that
the particle moves straight, but loses its energy due to
ionization of the ambient air or is lost due to nuclear
inelastic processes. The probability of a particle of type A
with initial energy Eo to survive, against inelastic process,
until its energy becomes E0 is given as

(E, A) and lin(E, A) are the stopping power due to

collisions, respectively, as tabulated by Janni [1982]. The
energy E0 is related to the distance x traversed by the particle
along its trajectory as
x ¼ R Eoð Þ  R E0ð Þ; ð7Þ
where R(E) is the path length of a particle with energy E due
to ionization losses [Janni, 1982]. Then the isotope
production at a distance x is given as

where SA is taken from equation (5) and E

[14] The results obtained by CORSIKA appear quite
close to the analytical approximation, described above,
for the atmospheric depth h between 0 and 20 g/cm2
(altitude above 25 km). For the atmospheric layers above
h = 10 g/cm2 (about 30 km) we used the analytical results
of 7Be production (equation (11)).
2.4. Yield Function

one primary particle of type Awith energy Eo is an integral
over the entire atmospheric column

where hs.l. = 1033 g/cm
2 is the atmospheric depth at the sea
level. The dependence of q on the primary particle’s energy
is shown in Figure 2 for primary protons and a particles.
For comparison, a similar result of the WH03/07 model for
primary protons is also shown. The overall agreement is
quite good, taking into account the different models used.
[16] However, since we are interested in both the total
production and in its altitudinal profile, we present here a
concept of the yield function of 7Be at a given atmospheric
depth. The yield function is defined as the production of the
isotope by primary particles of type Awith the unit intensity
J (i.e., one primary particle with energy Eo in the interplan-
etary space per steradian per second per cm2) and is related
to the production function dq/dh (which is the isotope
production per unit flux F, i.e., one particle crossing a
horizontal 1 cm2 area at the top of the atmosphere per
second) as
Y Eo; h;Að Þ ¼ p dq
dh
Eo; h;Að Þ; ð13Þ
where the units of Y are atoms g1 cm2 sr. The factor p
appears as conversion between the flux on the top of the
atmosphere and CR intensity in the interplanetary space (see
equation (1)).
[17] The tabulated yield function is presented in Tables 2
and 3 for primary cosmic protons and a particles, respec-
tively. Throughout the paper we discuss the isotope pro-
duction per nucleon of the incident primary particle; that is,
the production by one a particle is four times that shown
here.
[18] As an additional test for the correctness of our
computations of the nucleonic component of the cascade
and the yield function, we computed the yield function of
a standard NM64 sea-level neutron monitor in a way
similar to equation (13), but using the NM64 efficiency
SNM64 [Hatton, 1971; Clem and Dorman, 2000] instead
of the 7Be production efficiency (equation (5)). A ground-
based neutron monitor detects, with the known efficiency,
superthermal secondary neutrons which are also the main
source of the 7Be isotope in the troposphere. The neutron
monitor yield function has been thoroughly studied earlier
by different groups and methods, including Monte Carlo
simulations and confronting the obtained results with
direct measurements in a wide range of conditions [see
Clem and Dorman, 2000; and references therein]. Thus
computed NM yield function is shown in Figure 3
together with the yield function computed by Clem and
Dorman [2000], and one can see a close agreement
between them, including both the shape and the absolute
values. This confirms correctness of our computations of
the flux of secondary neutrons in our approach.
2.5. Galactic Cosmic Rays Spectrum
[19] The spectrum of GCR at the Earth’s orbit is often
parameterized by the so-called force field model [Gleeson
and Axford, 1968; Caballero-Lopez and Moraal, 2004],
where the spectrum of ith specie (with the charge number
Zi and the mass number Ai) of CR at Earth’s orbit, Ji, is
related to an unmodulated local interstellar spectrum (LIS)

function of the energy of primary cosmic ray particle. Solid
and dotted curves depict the results of this work for primary
protons and a particles (the latter is shown per nucleon).
Open circles correspond to the computations byWebber and

of the same specie, JLIS,i via the modulation potential f
(given in GV) as:
Ji T ;fð Þ ¼ JLIS;i T þ Fið Þ Tð Þ T þ 2Trð Þ
T þ Fið Þ T þ Fi þ 2Trð Þ ; ð14Þ
where T is the particle’s kinetic energy per nucleon, Fi =
(eZi/Ai)f, and Tr is the proton’s rest energy. The modulation
potential provides a good single-parameter approximation
of the observed shape of the CR spectrum near Earth [e.g.,
Usoskin et al., 2005]. The value of f varies between about
0.4 GV (solar minimum) and 1.2 GV (solar maximum) but
may reach up to 2 GV during strong transient GCR
suppressions, such as Forbush decreases. An implicit
parameter of the force field approximation is the shape of
the LIS, which is not well known. Here we use the LIS for
protons according to Burger et al. [2000] in parameteriza-
tions by Usoskin et al. [2005]

where T is given in GeV/nucleon, and Tr = 0.938 GeV/
nucleon. As an example, Figure 4 shows the daily fluence of
galactic protons for solar maximum and minimum. The
solar cycle variations of the lower part of the spectrum are
as large as an order of magnitude.
[20] The LIS of the heavier species has been taken of the
same shape as the LIS of protons (equation (15)) but scaled
to match the abundance ratios in the interstellar space in
high energy [Alcaraz et al., 2000; Usoskin et al., 2005].
Note that the Zi/Ai ratio for a particles is half of that for
hydrogen with the same energy per nucleon, hence the
fraction of a particles in the overall CR flux near Earth is
increasing with decreasing particle’s energy and increasing
modulation potential (see equation (14)). Since the heavier
species are approximately identical to a particles in the
sense of the heliospheric modulation (Zi/Ai 
 1/2) as well as
in the 7Be production, we consider all the nuclei, heavier
than protons, as a particles with the corresponding number
of nucleons. The nucleonic ratio of heavier nuclei (including
a particles) to protons is chosen to be 0.3 in the interstellar
space [e.g., Gaisser and Stanev, 2004], i.e. (compare

2.6. Final Step in Computing the Isotope Production

[22] A product of the yield function Y and spectrum J is
the differential production function of 7Be:
D h;Eo;f;Að Þ ¼ Y h;Eo;Að Þ  J Eo;f;Að Þ: ð18Þ
[23] An example of the production function D for protons
is shown in Figure 5, for f = 0.7 GV and several values of
the atmospheric depth. One can see that the most effective
energy of cosmic rays for the isotope production depends on
the atmospheric depth. The maximum production in the
stratosphere is due to particles with an energy of about
1 GeV/nucleon. The peak, corresponding to the effective
energy, moves toward higher energies with decreasing
altitude, being about 3 GeV/nucleon for lower troposphere.
Once the production function D(Eo, h, A, f) is known, the
production of the isotope at a given atmospheric level h and
geomagnetic cutoff rigidity Pc can be computed as a sum
(over different species of cosmic rays) of integrals of D over
the energy of primary cosmic rays:

where Yi is the yield function and Ji is the differential energy
spectrum of the ith specie of GCR (protons and a particles
here). Integration is over the kinetic energy above Tc,i,
which is the kinetic energy corresponding to the local
vertical geomagnetic rigidity cutoff Pc. This cutoff energy
(per nucleon) depends on the Zi/Ai ratio of the cosmic ray
specie and is given as

[24] This implies that particles with the ratio of Zi/Ai < 1
are less deflected by the geomagnetic field, which, in
combination with their weaker heliospheric modulation,
makes them crucially important in the isotope production.
Therefore, contribution of heavier species cannot be
neglected in realistic models of the isotope production.
[25] We note that using the vertical geomagnetic cutoff Pc
does not account for realistic directional geomagnetic cut-
offs but it provides a reasonable first-order approximation
[e.g., Cooke, 1983; O’Brien, 2005] to the effective cutoff for
isotropically impinging flux. Although this approach is
supported by the agreement between our results and the
measurements, it may be a source of uncertainties, and
detailed computations of cosmic ray transport in the mag-
netosphere are planned for the future. A question of the

precise determination of Pc for a given location and time is a
separate problem [Cooke et al., 1991; Kudela and Bobik,
2004], which is left beyond the scope of the present study.
2.7. Recipe
[26] By means of the above formalism one can easily
compute the 7Be production rate for a given altitude h,
location Pc and time (or actually, the modulation potential
f), using the following recipe:
[27] 1. Tabulated values of the yield function Y(Eo, h)/p
are given in Tables 2 and 3 for protons and a particles,
respectively.
[28] 2. The value of the modulation potential f can be
obtained for a given period from Usoskin et al. [2005] or
from a continuously updated list at http://cosmicrays.oulu.fi/
phi. The shape of the differential energy spectrum J(T, f) is
then calculated using equations (14)–(17) for both protons
and a particles.
[29] 3. The final production rate is computed using
equation (19), where the integration bounds are different
for the two species of GCR (see equation (20)).
[30] The authors have also computed and tabulated the
production rate Q (equation (19)) for a 3-D grid of h (0–
1030 g/cm2 with the grid size of 10 g/cm2), Pc (0–20 GV
with the grid size of 0.5 GV) and f(0–1.5 GV with the grid
size of 0.05 GV). These digital tables are available in the
auxiliary material1 or can be requested directly from the
authors. The authors would be also happy to provide, upon
requests, computation of 7Be production rate for any spe-
cific location and/or time, including contribution from solar
energetic particles (see section 4).
2.8. Results
[31] The main result of this model is a three-dimensional
(h, Pc and f) matrix of the
7Be production rate Q, which can
be found in the auxiliary material or requested from the
authors. Since a 3-D function cannot be plotted, we show in
Figure 6 its 2-D projection for a fixed medium cosmic ray
modulation.
[32] One can see that the strongest dependence is over the
atmospheric depth (altitude), being two–three orders of
magnitude between the maximum at 20–30 km and the
minimum at the sea level. Dependence on the geomagnetic
cutoff rigidity is moderate, being a factor of 3–20 (depending
on the altitude) between geomagnetic poles and equator. The
range of production variations due to the 11-year solar cycle is
from15% (sea level at the equator) to a factor of 3 (polar upper
stratosphere). Four curves bounding geographical (between
the geomagnetic pole and equator) and solar cycle variations
of the production rate are shown in Figure 7.
[33] We note that the total or column production (i.e.,
production within the atmospheric column of unit area) of
7Be is not representative because of the isotope’s short
lifetime, comparable to or shorter than the residence time.
Therefore, a more local production should be considered,
especially in the stratosphere. However, for the sake of
comparison with other models, we have computed the
column production as a function of the geomagnetic latitude
as shown in Figure 8. The global average production of 7Be
in the atmosphere is evaluated as 0.078 and 0.05 (at cm2
s1) for the solar minimum (f = 0.4 GV) and maximum (f =
1.2 GV), respectively. The global production for the medi-
um solar activity (f = 0.7 GV) is 0.062 (at cm2 s1), which
can be compared with the results of other models in Table 1.
These values are computed for the geomagnetic field,
corresponding to the epoch 2005. Keeping in mind that
the geomagnetic field strength keeps steadily decreasing

during the last centuries, the estimated 7Be global produc-
tion was about 0.067 (at cm2 s1), i.e., 8% higher, for the
epoch 1955.
3. Testing the Model
3.1. Comparison With 7Be Measurements
[34] Because of the wide diversity of model results (as
discussed in the forthcoming subsection), we first compare
our simulation results with direct measurements as the most
robust test.
3.1.1. Production Rate
[35] The most direct comparison would be with measure-
ments of the production rate of the isotope in the atmo-
sphere. We know one such experiment [Lal et al., 1960],
when a sealed tank filled with oxygen target was exposed
during two months (July–August 1959) at Echo Lake
(Colorado) site at the atmospheric depth 685 g/cm2. The
average (corrected for decay) production rate of 7Be in this
oxygen tank was 9  106 at [g target O]1 s1. Using the
appropriate parameters (only oxygen target, h = 685 g/cm2,
Pc = 3 GV, f 
 1.3 GV for July–August 1959 [Usoskin et
al., 2005]) we have obtained the expected production rate of
8  106 at [g target O]1 s1. Thus, the model result agrees
well with the direct measurement of 7Be production rate in
the troposphere.
3.1.2. Concentration in Stratospheric Air
[36] There have been numerous measurements of the 7Be
concentration in the atmosphere, from surface to the strato-
sphere. We show in Figure 9 some results of airborne
measurements of the 7Be concentrations compared with
the model prediction for the same conditions (h, Pc and
f) taken individually for each measurement. The measured
concentrations have been converted into the production rate
assuming equilibrium between decay and production. The
agreement is quite good (within 20%) in the stratosphere
(values above 104 at g1 s1), but a large disagreement is
observed in the troposphere. Such a pattern is quite clear
since the concentration of 7Be is expected to be close to the
equilibrium one in the stratosphere, where the isotope’s
residence time is longer than the decay time. In the
troposphere, however, 7Be is quickly washed out leading
to the residence time shorter than the decay time. Accord-
ingly, the measured concentration is different from the
equilibrium one, and the difference depends on location
and season [e.g., Kulan et al., 2006].
[37] Thus, our model depicts a fairly good agreement
with fragmentary data on stratospheric measurements of 7Be
concentration, assuming equilibrium conditions. This is a
rough method, and a detailed comparison can be performed
only taking into account realistic 3-D transport of air masses
[e.g., Koch et al., 1996; Liu et al., 2001; Field et al., 2006].
Such a comparison is beyond the scope of this study, but is
planned for further work.
3.1.3. Concentration in Rain Water as Estimate for
Tropospheric Production
[38] As discussed earlier, concentration of 7Be measured
in tropospheric air cannot give an easy estimate of the
production rate. However, there are measurements of 7Be
concentration in rain water in different regions. Of special
interest are regions with high level of precipitation, which
washes out almost all isotope atoms produced in the
troposphere. Particularly interesting is Indian region, with
heavy rains during the monsoon season, where the wet
deposition dominates [Field et al., 2006]. This data is not
expected to be affected by the seasonal (spring and fall)
breaks of 7Be-rich stratospheric air into the troposphere,
because first the monsoon season does not usually overlap

production of 7Be for a medium solar activity as function of
geomagnetic latitude, according to different models (results
for WH07 model are obtained as scaling of the 10Be results),
as indicated in the legend. Results are shown in log scale in
order to compare the shape of curves.

with the seasonal breaks and second the air mixing effect is
smaller in tropics compared to the midlatitudes [Field et al.,
2006]. Several measurements of 7Be content in the rain
water have been performed during the period 1956–1959 in
two Indian sites: Kodaikanal (Pc 
 16 GV, about 175 cm
rainfall) and Bombay (Pc 
 15 GV, about 100 cm rainfall)
[Rama, 1960]. The corresponding averaged measured 7Be
flux was found to be 1  102 and 9  103 (at cm2 s1),
respectively. These values are close to the modeled isotope’s
production rate, 8.5  103 (at cm2 s1), computed for f =
1 GV (mean modulation for 1956–1959) in the atmospheric
layer 240–1030 g/cm2 (0–11 km) for Pc = 15 GV. This
assumes that all the 7Be atoms produced in the troposphere
are quickly, within 30 days [Shapiro and Forbes-Resha,
1976] (correction for decay has been applied [see Rama,
1960]), scavenged and eventually appear in the rain water.
[39] Thus, prediction of our model is in a reasonable
agreement with the 7Be fallout flux evaluated from meas-
urements in rain water collected in India monsoon regions.
[40] Concluding this section we note that, while a direct
comparison of model results with measurements is only
indicative and cannot prove, in this simple form, the
exactness of the model, it provides a solid ground to suggest
that our model is broadly consistent with observations in the
whole range: from ground level up to the stratosphere, and
from equatorial to polar regions. Moreover, the fact that our
model result agrees with an experiment of direct measure-
ments of the cosmogenic 7Be production rate in oxygen
target (section 3.1.1) implies the correct overall normaliza-
tion of the model.
3.2. Comparison With Other Models
[41] In this subsection we make an intercomparison
between different models for 7Be production. First we can
compare the predicted total production of 7Be in the
atmosphere. It is noteworthy that the overall global produc-
tion figures for an average solar cycle are quite controversial
as given by different models (see the last row in Table 1).
Our present model yields the global production rate close to
those given by empirical and semi empirical models (LP67,
OB79, N00) but higher than other Monte Carlo models. The
present results are significantly (by a factor of 2) higher than
the predictions by MB99 and WH03/07 models, and this
difference is too high to be ascribed to different approaches
and assumptions used. The difference is most likely related to
an overall normalization rather than to modeling nuances. On
the contrary, Monte Carlo models (MB99, WH03/07 and the
present one) operate with pure simulations without direct
fitting to the observed data, and thus are not guaranteed against
a normalization error.
[42] All earlier models, except of OB79 one, provide
latitudinal dependence of the column isotope production,
as shown in Figure 8. One can see that the latitudinal
dependence is similar for all the models, implying a similar
treatment of the geomagnetic shielding. The polar-to-
equatorial production ratio is about 6 for most of the
models, only LP67 and N00 models yield a slightly weaker
latitudinal dependence, with the polar-to-equatorial produc-
tion ratio being about 5.
[43] Among earlier models only the LP67 one provides
altitude profiles of 7Be production, and we compare those
for the polar and equatorial conditions, as shown in
Figure 10. While the overall level is slightly different
(compare Figure 8), shapes of the profiles are close to each
other in the troposphere. Although MB99 model does not
provide an altitudinal dependence of the isotope production,
it estimates the relative stratospheric production as 53.5% of
the entire atmospheric production, using a realistic latitude-
dependent height of the tropopause. When using the same
relative thickness of the troposphere as function of latitude
(Figure 7 in MB99), we obtain with our model that 55% of
the global 7Be production can be ascribed to stratosphere.
Both LP67 and N00 models yield that about 60–70% of
7Be is produced in the stratosphere globally, which is
consistent with the results of our model, 68%, assuming
the constant heights of the tropopause at about 11 km. Note
that WH03/07 model does not provide results of the relative
stratospheric production.
[44] Thus, we can conclude that the present model does
not contradict with earlier models in the relative variations
of 7Be production in both latitude and altitude. However,
absolute values of the production rate differ from some
earlier computations:
[45] 1. Our model results broadly agree with those by the
semiempirical LP67 model, yielding however slightly lower
(about 25%) global production rate.
[46] 2. Our model agrees with the analytical OB79 model
in the global production similar, however the latter does not
provide enough results for detailed investigation.
[47] 3. Our model predicts the global production by a
factor 2 higher than the results of the MB99 model. This
discrepancy is too large to be ascribed to some technical
Figure 10. Altitude profile of 7Be production rate for the
medium solar modulation (f = 0.6 GV), for geomagnetic
polar and equatorial regions. Curves and symbols corre-
spond to the results of the present and LP67 models,
respectively. The present results have been converted from
the atmospheric depth to the altitude using the US standard
atmosphere model. The results of LP67, originally given in
atoms per min per m3 STP, have been scaled to the present
units of Y axis.

differences in the model treatment, and is most likely caused
by an overall normalization.
[48] 4. Our model broadly agrees with a semiempirical
N00 model, including the altitudinal profile.
[49] 5. Our model is similar to the results of a recent
WH03/07 model in many respects, but predicts higher (by a
factor of 2) absolute production rate. The fact that the
differential column production of 7Be by cosmic protons,
computed by the two models, is very close to each other
(see Figure 2) implies that cascade simulations were done
consistently in the two models. Additionally, treatment of
the geomagnetic shielding was also done mutually consis-
tently (Figure 8). Therefore, we suppose that the difference
in the total production between WH03/07 and our model
can be due to the different treatment of primary cosmic rays
(see Table 1) or the integration.
[50] More important is that the results of our model are in
good agreement with actual measurements, including the
direct measurement of 7Be production rate in a special target
(section 3.1.1). Because of the large diversity of the mod-
eling results in the total production rate, we mostly rely
upon comparison with measurements. Therefore, we have
good reasons to believe that the overall normalization of our
model is correct.
4. Effect of Solar Energetic Particles
[51] While galactic CR are always present in the Earth’s
environment, additional sporadic fluxes of solar energetic
particles (SEPs) can occur related to solar eruptive phe-
nomenon (solar flares or coronal mass ejections), leading to
transient changes in the 7Be production in the atmosphere.
As an example, we consider here the effect of a severe SEP
event of 20 January 2005, which was one of the strongest
events ever observed. Time profile of the neutron monitor
count rate for this event is shown in Figure 11a, with a clear
ground level enhancement (GLE) of a few hours duration. It
is important that the GLE occurred during the continuing
effect of a strong Forbush decrease caused by the interplan-
etary shock, when the CR level was reduced by 10–15% for
a week (Figure 11a). The net effect of the sequence of
events is negative in the neutron monitor count rate (i.e., the
long-lasting Forbush decrease overcompensates the CR
increase during the transient GLE). Figure 11b shows the
calculated relative effect of the studied event, which is
defined as follows. First, we have computed the production
of 7Be by GCR during the day of 20 January 2005, when
the GLE occurred, and during a quite day of 15 January,
using the values of f = 1.3 and 0.69 GV, respectively
(calculated using the method described by Usoskin et al.
[2005]). Next we evaluated the spectrum (daily fluence) of
SEP during the day of 20 January, using the spaceborne data
fitted by a power law (power index 2.15) in energy up to
0.5 GeV [Mewaldt et al., 2005], and applying an exponen-
tial energy cutoff in higher energy range to fit the data from
the world neutron monitor network. The resultant daily
fluence

; ð21Þ
where Eo and I are expressed in GeV and (cm
2 sr GeV)1,
respectively, is shown in Figure 4.
[52] Applying this spectrum to equation (19), one can
evaluate the additional production of 7Be due to SEPs. Let
us consider the ratio of the total (GCR + SEP) production
during the day of 20 January 2005 to the GCR 7Be
production during a quite day of 15 January 2005. This
ratio (or a relative effect of the SEP event in the isotope
production) is shown in Figure 11 as function of geomag-
netic latitude. One can see a greatly enhanced production of
7Be in the (geomagnetic) high-latitude region (geomagnetic
latitude above 60) at all altitudes. The enhancement of the

daily production was a factor of 2 at the sea level up to a
factor of 15 in the stratosphere. On the contrary, the isotope
production was reduced by 15–20% at lower geomagnetic
latitudes, because of the transient GCR suppression
(Forbush decrease) started 18 January. Therefore, a strong,
almost instantaneous, ‘‘injection’’ of 7Be isotope took place
in a limited geographical area during the extreme SEP event
of January 2005. Taking into account the fact that param-
eters (altitude, latitude and time profiles) of this ‘‘injection’’
can be modeled, this provides a unique opportunity to trace
the atmospheric transport on both global and local scales.
5. Conclusions
[53] We have presented a new model of production of
cosmogenic 7Be isotope in the atmosphere. The model,
based on full Monte Carlo simulation of the cosmic ray
induced nucleonic cascade in the atmosphere, is able to
compute 3-D (altitude and geographical location) produc-
tion rate of the isotope in realistic conditions. The validity of
the model has been verified by quantitative agreement with
different kinds of observations, including direct measure-
ments of 7Be production rate in a dedicated experiment. The
present model is in qualitative agreement with earlier
models, but deviates from some of them in the absolute
values.
[54] We provide a detailed recipe and a set of precalcu-
lated digital tables (Tables 2 and 3 and the auxiliary
material) for the yield function. Using this ‘‘do-it-yourself’’
kit everyone interested can compute the 7Be production for
given location, altitude and the spectrum of cosmic rays,
including solar energetic particles. This provides a new
opportunity in studying details of the atmospheric transport,
since it allows, e.g., computing the isotope production along
the specific trajectory of a traced air volume.
[55] We have computed the effect of a severe solar
energetic particle event of 20 January 2005 and shown that
it resulted in greatly enhanced production of 7Be in (geo-
magnetic) polar regions, accompanied by suppression in all
other regions. This very unusual distribution of the isotope
production pattern provides a unique opportunity to study
details of the atmospheric (particularly tropospheric) circu-
lation and transport.
