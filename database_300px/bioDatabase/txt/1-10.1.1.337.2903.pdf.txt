Abstract
Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor upon DNA damage
elicits either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and the precise
mechanism governing cell fate after p53 response has not
been well defined. Through genomic analysis, we have
identified the ribosomal protein S27-like (RPS27L) as a novel
p53 transcriptional target gene. Although RPS27L mRNA
levels were consistently induced after diverse p53 activating
signals, its change in protein level was stimuli-dependent: it
was up-regulated when cells were arrested in response to
DNA-damaging agents Adriamycin or VP16 but was down-
regulated when cells underwent apoptosis in response to
antimetabolite agent 5-fluorouracil. RPS27L is a nuclear
protein that forms nuclear foci upon DNA damage. Depletion
of RPS27L resulted in deficiency in DNA damage checkpoints,
leading to conversion of DNA damage–induced p53 response
from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis. We further show that
RPS27L positively regulates p21 protein expression. Through
this mechanism, RPS27L induction by p53 facilitates p21-
mediated cell cycle arrest and protects against DNA damage–
induced apoptosis. Thus, RPS27L modulates DNA damage
response and functions as a part of the control switch to
determine cell fate to DNA damage–p53 response. [Cancer Res
2007;67(23):11317–26]
Introduction
In response to DNA damage, mammalian cells activate a
protection system to enable repair to continue normal life cycle
or they may activate the apoptotic machinery in the face of
excessive and irreparable damage (1). The tumor suppressor p53
is believed to play important roles in DNA damage response. As
a transcription factor with DNA-binding activity, p53 binds to
many target genes and actively regulates their transcription (2–5).
Major consequences of p53 activation after DNA damage include
the induction of cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis (6–8).
It is well known that p53-dependent cell cycle arrest is primarily
mediated through transcriptional induction of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p21 (9, 10). The mechanism for p53-induced
apoptosis, however, is less clear. p53 might induce apoptosis
through transcriptional activation of apoptotic target genes, such
as PUMA, BAX, NOXA, BID, PIG3, CD95, DR5 , or p53AIP1 (6, 7, 11),
or through a transcription-independent mechanism involving
direct Bax/Bak activation in the mitochondria (12–15).
The cellular response to p53 activation after DNA damage varies
by cell type and stimuli. The response could be the initiation of
DNA repair and the damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest
or apoptosis as a result of defective DNA repair. For example,
activation of p53 by the DNA-damaging agent Adriamycin resulted
in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells, whereas in the
same cells p53 activation by the DNA analogue 5-flurouracil (5-FU)
gave rise to apoptosis (16). The signals governing cell fate after p53
response to different genotoxic stresses are yet to be understood.
Nevertheless, increasing evidence suggests that p53-dependent
transcription often elicits an antiapoptotic response in human
cancer cells, and p21 is believed to be the key molecule that
mediates this antiapoptotic response (17–19). In addition to the
well-defined p21 function as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor,
p21 also acts to inhibit proapoptotic effectors, such as pro–
caspase-3, caspase 8, and ASK1 (19, 20). Depletion of p21 in cancer
cells led to enhanced apoptosis in response to DNA damage both
in vitro and in vivo (16, 21–24). Inhibition of p21 transcription
through overexpression of Myc (25) or inhibition of p21 protein
translation by the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (26, 27) can lead to the
conversion of DNA damage–induced p53 response from growth
arrest to apoptosis. Thus, manipulation of p21 level seems to be a
feasible approach for modulating chemotherapeutic response (18).
In this study, we identify ribosomal protein S27-like (RPS27L) as
a novel p53 target that participates in DNA damage response.
Functional analysis indicates that RPS27L functions as an
important molecular determinant of cell fate after DNA damage–
induced p53 activation.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drugs. The human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells
and the p53 knockout HCT116 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bert
Vogelstein. The human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS and Saos-2 were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-
streptomycin (Invitrogen). Adriamycin, VP16, and 5-FU were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Microarray hybridization and data analysis. Total RNA was extracted
with the use of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The methods for probe labeling
reaction and microarray hybridization were described previously (2). For
all experiments, universal human reference RNA (Stratagene) was used to
generate a reference probe for drug-treated and untreated samples. Total
RNA (30 Ag) from experimental samples or equal amounts of universal
human reference RNA were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, by using
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The log2 ratios of each time

point were then normalized for each gene to that of untreated cells (time 0)
to obtain the relative expression pattern. The genes that showed substantial
differences after drug treatment were selected based on a 2-fold change in
expression values for at least two time points across all experimental
conditions. Genes that met the criteria were further analyzed using
clustering and display programs (rana.stanford.edu/software) developed by
Eisen et al. (28).
Reverse transcription–PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted using
RNeasy kit (Qiagen). All reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was done
using the Titanium One Step RT-PCR kit (BD Clontech). Primer sequences
are as follows: p21, forward 5¶-ATGTCAGAACCGGCTGGGGA-3¶/reverse
5¶-ATCACAGTCGCGGCTCAGCT-3¶; RPS27L, forward 5¶-GTGACGACCTAC-

3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), forward 5¶-CAAAGTTGTCATGGAT-
GACC-3¶/reverse 5¶-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3¶.
Flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was done by DNA content
quantification. The cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with
propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) staining. The stained cells were analyzed by

FACScalibur (BD Bioscience). For BrdUrd incorporation assay and
mitochondrial membrane potential detection, the BrdUrd flow kit and
JC-1 staining kit (both from BD Bioscience) were used, respectively,
following the instruction manual. Stained cells were analyzed by
FACScalibur (BD Bioscience) and quantified by using CellQuest software
(BD Bioscience).
Gene silence by RNA interference. The small interfering RNA (siRNA)
oligo targeting RPS27L (sequence, GGTTGCTACAAGATTACTA) and
negative control siRNA (sequence, TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) was
purchased from Sigma-Proligo, and transfection was conducted using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To generate stable knockdown cell lines,
the siRNA sequences were cloned into the pSIREN-RetroQ retroviral
expression vector (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Virally infected cells were selected in a medium containing
2 Ag/mL puromycin for 2 weeks and individual drug-resistant clones were
collected and expanded. Two additional siRNAs against RPS27L were also
used: 5¶- CATGCCTTTGGCTAGAGATTT-3¶ and 5¶-TGTCCAGGTTGCTA-
CAAGATT-3¶.
Protein analysis and generation of anti-RPS27L antibody. Cells
were harvested and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitors]. Protein
concentrations were determined with the Bradford protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad). Protein samples (20-50 Ag) were separated by SDS-PAGE,
transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and blotted with
anti-p53 and anti-p21 antibodies (Santa Cruz) and anti-MDM2 and anti-
PUMA antibodies (Merck). The rabbit polyclonal antibody to RPS27L was
raised against a 14–amino acid peptide from human RPS27L (LHPSLE-
EEKKKHKK).
Luciferase report assay. The promoter elements of RPS27L were cloned
into the pGL3-luciferase vector (Promega). HCT116 p53/ cells were plated
in 24-well cell culture plates and cotransfected with p53 expression vectors
and RPS27L promoter plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the
luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase system
(Promega) as previously described (2).
Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. The cells
were seeded in four-well or eight-well culture slides. After treatment, cells
were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeablized with 0.2%
Triton-X100. Cells were sequentially incubated with 10% FBS in PBS for
blocking primary antibodies in 1:100 dilution (RPS27L as indicated above,
c-Myc from Roche, gH2AX from Upstate, and phosphorylated ATM from
Cell Signaling) and Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546–conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) in 1:1,000 dilution for 1 h each and
mounted in Fluorsave (Merck) mounting medium. DRAQ5 (Biostats) was
diluted 1:1,000 in mounting medium for nuclear staining. The stained cells
were examined by Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscopy.
Plasmids. pcDNA4/RPS27L-Myc was generated by RT-PCR using normal
colon tissue total RNA (Ambion), PowerScript reverse transcriptase
(Clontech), and Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen) with
the primers 5¶-GGTACCATGCCTTTGGCTAGAGATTT-3¶ ( forward) and
5¶-GAATTCTTAGTGTTGCTTTCTTCTAAATGA-3¶ (reverse). The PCR prod-
uct and empty vector were digested with KpnI and EcoRI (New England
Biolab) and ligated with T4 ligase (New England Biolab), followed by
transformation and selection.
Cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay. After treatment with
Adriamycin, cells were incubated with cytochalasin B (5 Ag/mL; Sigma)
for an additional 22 h. The cells were then trypsinized and subsequently
fixed using a combination of both Carnoy’s fixative (acetic acid/methanol,
1:3) and three to four drops of formaldehyde (to fix the cytoplasm). Fixed
cells were dropped onto clean slides and stained with 3 Ag/mL acridine
orange (which differentially stains cytoplasm and nucleus). One thousand
binucleated cells were scored for each sample.
Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Cells were
treated with Adriamycin with the doses mentioned above. The treated
cells were subjected to a single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay as
described earlier (29) and stained with SYBR green dye. The tail moment
of the comets was generated using the Metasystems (Germany) analysis
software comet imager version 1.2. Fifty randomly chosen comets were
analyzed per sample. The extent of DNA damage observed was expressed
as tail moment, which corresponded to the fraction of the DNA in the tail
of the comet.
Results
Genomic analysis identifies RPS27L as a direct transcrip-
tional target of p53. p53 exerts its tumor suppressor function
predominately through transcriptional regulation on downstream
targets (6, 7, 30). In our previous efforts to identify additional p53
targets through large-scale gene expression analysis (2), we had
observed that RPS27L , which encodes RPS27L with a previously
unknown function, was strongly regulated by p53. Figure 1A is the

microarray analysis showing a set of genes whose expression was
induced by the DNA-damaging agents Adriamycin and 5-FU in p53
wild type but not in p53 knockout HCT116 cells. In both drug
treatments, RPS27L , together with bona fide p53 targets, such as
cdkn1a (encodes p21), Pmaid (encodes Noxa), and ccd3 (encodes
Puma), was up-regulated in a p53-dependent manner. To validate
the microarray data, we did RT-PCR analysis. Figure 1B shows that
RPS27L mRNA was strongly induced after Adriamycin or 5-FU
treatment in p53 wild-type, but not in p53 knockout, HCT116
cells. Of note, 5-FU also slightly induced RPS27L in p53/ cells,
indicating that 5-FU can also induce RPS27L through other
mechanisms. Furthermore, we have previously identified up to
500 p53-binding targets in HCT116 cells treated with 5-FU by using
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–positron emission tomog-
raphy (PET) technology (31). Among these p53-binding targets,
RPS27L was found to be strongly bound by p53 through a p53-
binding motif located in the first intron (Fig. 1C). Thus, RPS27L
expression seems to be up-regulated by p53 through direct DNA
binding.
To assess whether the ChIP-identified p53 binding is functional,
we cloned a genomic DNA fragment containing the p53-binding
site in the first intron (Luc-RPS27L-A), as well as a fragment
spanning a 1.3-kb promoter region (Luc-RPS27L-B) into a luciferase
reporter plasmid. When cotransfected into p53 knockout HCT116
cells together with a p53 expression plasmid, only the reporter
containing the intronic sequences was activated by p53 wild-type
but not by a DNA binding–deficient p53 mutant (R175H; Fig. 1D).
As a positive control, wild-type but not the mutant p53 also
activated a reporter containing the p21 promoter. These results
confirm that the p53 binding located in the first intron, as
determined by ChIP analysis, is functional and confers the p53
responsiveness.

vector. The transfected cells were fixed and stained with anti-Myc antibody and FITC-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin (green ), followed by confocal
microscopy examination. Nuclei were stained with DRAQ5 (blue ). Rodamine-phalloiadin was used for counterstaining of the actin cytoskeleton (red). B, HCT116 control
and RPS27L-depleted cells were treated with VP16 (20 Amol/L) for 16 h. Colocalization of RPS27L with g-H2AX or phosphorylated ATM was detected by
immunofluorescence staining with anti-RPS27L (green) and anti–g-H2AX or anti–phosphorylated ATM (1981; red). Nuclei were stained by DRAQ5 (blue ).

p53-dependent RPS27L protein level induction is stimuli
dependent. To investigate whether the p53-induced increase in
RPS27L mRNA also gives rise to the protein induction, we
performed immunoblot analysis of p53 wild-type and p53 knockout
HCT116 cells treated with Adriamycin, 5-FU, or Nutlin-3, a small
molecule MDM2 antagonist that directly activates p53 (32). As
anticipated, Adriamycin or Nutlin-3 treatment resulted in the
accumulation of p53 and p21 in p53 wild-type HCT116 cells.
RPS27L protein induction, as detected by an antibody raised
against a RPS27L peptide, was also detected after Adriamycin or
Nutlin-3 treatment in these cells (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, 5-FU–
induced up-regulation of RPS27L mRNA did not result in increased
protein expression as expected. Rather, it was even down-regulated.
To extend our observations to additional cell lines or stimuli, we
treated U2OS and SH-SY5Y cells (p53 wild type) as well as Saos-2
cells (p53 deficient) with Adriamycin, VP16, and 5-FU (Fig. 2B).

by RT-PCR in control and RPS27L shRNA cells treated with VP16 at indicated times. RPS27L protein expression was examined by Western blot in control and
RPS27L shRNA cells. B, HCT116 p53+/+ and p53/ cells stably expressing the RPS27L shRNA or a control shRNA were treated with Adriamycin (1 Amol/L) or VP16
(10 Amol/L) for 48 h. Cell death was measured by cells with sub-G1 DNA content. C, HCT116 p53+/+ and p53/ cells were transfected with RPS27L siRNA, followed by
VP16 (10 Amol/L) or Adriamycin (1 Amol/L) treatment for 24 h. Cell death was measured by cells with sub-G1 DNA content. Columns, mean of three independent

(bottom ).
RPS27L Modulates DNA Damage Response

RPS27L protein levels were markedly induced, together with p53
and p21, in Adriamycin-treated or VP16-treated U2OS and SH-SY5Y
cells, but not in Saos-2 cells. Again, RPS27L protein levels were
either unchanged or decreased in response to 5-FU. Collectively,
these results indicate that, despite the consistent induction of
RPS27L mRNA after various p53-activating signals, its change in
protein level depends on the type of genotoxic stress.
RPS27L is a nuclear protein that forms nuclear foci upon
DNA damage. To further characterize the involvement of RPS27L
in DNA damage response, we evaluated the cellular localization of
RPS27L. We overexpressed c-Myc–tagged RPS27L in HCT116 cells
and detected its expression by immunofluorescence staining with
an anti–c-Myc antibody. The results indicate that ectopically
expressed RPS27L localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 3A). To determine
the cellular location of the endogenous RPS27L and assess its
participation in DNA damage response, we performed immuno-
fluoresence studies using the anti-RPS27L antibody in both
HCT116 wild-type cells and HCT116 cells depleted of RPS27L
(see below). Because of the low expression of RPS27L in untreated
cells, we obtained low nuclear staining in these cells (data not
shown). Upon DNA damage by VP16, we detected a nuclear foci-
like staining pattern in HCT116 cells with anti-RPS27L (Fig. 3B).
Moreover, RPS27L staining partially colocalized with phosphory-
lated histone H2AX (g-HA2X), a hallmark of DNA double-strand
breaks (33) or phosphorylated ATM upon VP16 treatment. Depletion
of RPS27L expression abolished these colocalizations, although
it had no effect on g-HA2X or phosphorylated ATM foci formation.
These data suggest that RPS27L is a nuclear protein that
participates in DNA damage response and is recruited to a subset
of DNA double-strand breaks.
RPS27L regulates apoptotic response to genotoxic stress. In
response to DNA damage, p53 induces cell cycle arrest, senescence,
or apoptosis, depending on the cellular context or type of stress. In
HCT116 cells, it is known that the DNA damaging agent, such as
Adriamycin, induces a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, whereas
DNA analogue 5-FU treatment triggers a p53-dependent apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 16, 34). Because RPS27L protein
expression was induced in Adriamycin-treated HCT116 cells but
decreased in response to 5-FU treatment, we next set out to
determine the functional role of RPS27L in these cellular responses.
First, we investigated whether silencing of RPS27L would convert
Adriamycin-induced cell cycle arrest to apoptosis in HCT116
cells. To achieve this aim, we generated cell lines derived from
HCT116 that constitutively expressed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
targeting RPS27L (RPS27L shRNA) or a nonspecific control shRNA
(control shRNA) in both p53 wild-type and p53 knockout
backgrounds. The targeted sequence for gene silencing was
efficient and specific, as it almost completely ablated RPS27L
expression and prevented its induction after DNA damage while
having no effect on closely related RPS27 (Fig. 4A). In p53 wild-type
HCT116 cells expressing the control shRNA, VP16 or Adriamycin
treatment for 48 h primarily resulted in a cell cycle arrest response
in both G1 and G2 phase with minimal cell death, whereas cells
expressing RPS27L shRNA exhibited marked loss of G1 arrest but
an increase in cell death upon Adriamycin or VP16 treatment
(Fig. 4B). This effect seemed to be p53 dependent, as RPS27L
depletion in p53 knockout HCT116 cells did not give the same
results. Knockdown of RPS27L through transient siRNA transfec-
tion also resulted in a marked increase in cell death upon
Adriamycin or VP16 treatment only in p53 wild-type cells (Fig. 4C).
Similar effects were also seen in p53 normal lung carcinoma A549
and osteosarcoma U2OS cells but not in p53-deficient Saos-2 cells
(data not shown), indicating that the increased cell death response
to DNA-damaging agents is a general feature of RPS27L depletion.
Importantly, targeting RPS27L by using two additional siRNA
against RPS27L also resulted in evident loss of G1 arrest and
significant induction of cell death upon Adriamycin and VP16
treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S2). This indicates that the

observed effect upon RPS27L depletion is not due to off-target of
RPS27L siRNA.
To further define the nature of this cell death response, we used
another assay, namely flow cytometric detection of cells stained
with JC-1. The JC-1 staining identifies cell death events associated
with the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (DCm).
Treatment of HCT116 RPS27L shRNA cells with Adriamycin
resulted in a marked decrease in DCm compared with the control
cells (33.5% versus 13.5%), indicating an apoptotic cell death
involving mitochondrial dysfunction (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Taken together, these results suggest that RPS27L mediates an
antiapoptotic response upon DNA damage.
As RPS27L protein level was reduced in apoptotic response to
5-FU, we next sought to determine whether overexpression of
RPS27L would inhibit 5-FU–induced apoptosis. To this end, we had
established HCT116 cells stably expressing exogenous RPS27L-myc
(Fig. 4D). Although the stable clones were unable to express high
levels of exogenous RPS27L that was also down-regulated after
5-FU treatment (data not shown), the two clones we generated did
exhibit reduced apoptotic response to 5-FU compared with the
control clones that express an empty vector (Fig. 4D). This result
further supports the idea that RPS27L functions as an antiapop-
totic molecule and its decrease upon 5-FU treatment might
contribute to 5-FU–induced apoptosis.
RPS27L regulates p21 protein accumulation upon DNA
damage. We next sought to delineate the pathway via which
RPS27L functions in the DNA damage response. Because only p53
wild-type cells were sensitized to DNA damage upon loss of
RPS27L, RPS27L should genetically function within this pathway.
We examined the effects of RPS27L silencing on p53 and its
downstream targets p21, PUMA, and MDM2 by immunoblot
analysis. Silencing of RPS27L did not seem to affect p53 induction
by Adriamycin (Fig. 5A). However, p21 induction was markedly
compromised in RPS27L-depleted cells compared with the control
cells, whereas the induction of PUMA or MDM2 was unaffected by
PRS27L depletion. This indicates that depletion of RPS27L impairs
the p21 induction by DNA damage, and this effect seems to be
selective. A similar result was also seen in U2OS cells, indicating
that the observed effect on p21 upon loss of RPS27L is not cell type
specific.
We further found that the reduced p21 protein level was not due
to inhibited p21 transcription because p21 mRNA levels were not

significantly changed in RPS27L-depleted cells compared with the
control cells (Fig. 5B). To obtain direct evidence that RPS27L has
the ability to regulate p21 protein expression, we cotransfected
a p21-expressing vector with increasing amounts of an RPS27L-
expressing vector into HCT116 cells, and the result showed that
overexpression of RPS27L up-regulated p21 protein expression in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, cells expressing
RPS27L show reduced cells in S phase but not in cells lacking of
p21 (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these findings suggest that RPS27L
positively regulates p21 protein expression and functions as
antiproliferation molecule. Loss of RPS27L results in attenuated
p21 protein induction after DNA damage.
To determine whether p21 protein down-regulation seen in
RPS27L shRNA cells arises from decreased mRNA stability or
increased protein degradation, we evaluated the p21 mRNA and
protein levels in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide
that inhibits transcription and protein synthesis, respectively.
The result indicated that the stabilities of p21 mRNA and protein
levels in RPS27L shRNA cells were similar to that in control cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). These results suggest that the
down-regulation of p21 upon loss of RPS27L was not due to
changes in p21 mRNA or protein stability. Furthermore, we did not
find that p21 physically interacts with RPS27L by coimmunopre-
cipitation assay (data not shown).
RPS27L regulates cell cycle checkpoint, DNA repair, and
genome stability in DNA damage response. Cells lacking p21 are
defective in cell cycle arrest and are more sensitive to DNA damage
(21, 23, 35–37). Because RPS27L positively regulates p21 protein
level, we reasoned that the cells depleted of RPS27L would have
associated phenotypes similar to cells lacking p21. To facilitate this
comparison, we created a HCT116 cell line stably expressing p21
shRNA. In these cells, p21 expression and its induction after
Adriamycin treatment were confirmed to be markedly inhibited
and, as anticipated, exhibited increased sensitivity to Adriamycin
(Fig. 6A). Moreover, knockdown of RPS27L in p21 shRNA cells did
not result in further increase in apoptosis upon DNA damage,
further supporting that RPS27L, at least in part, mediates through
p21 for its biological function (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To further characterize the effect of RPS27L knockdown on cell
cycle progression upon DNA damage, we performed fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with 7-amino-actinomycin D
staining ( for total DNA content) and BrdUrd labeling ( for DNA
synthesis) and compared the results with that of p21 shRNA cells.
HCT116 cells lacking RPS27L or p21 exhibited similar levels of DNA
synthesis in untreated cells. However, after Adriamycin treatment
for 24 h, parental HCT116 cells underwent a dramatic decrease in
DNA synthesis ( from 85% to 11%), whereas in HCT116 cells lacking
p21 or RPS27L this decrease in DNA synthesis was partially rescued
( from 77% to 31% and from 86% to 27%, respectively; Fig. 6B). This
result indicates that cells lacking RPS27L or p21 did prematurely
leak through the G1 checkpoint entering S phase and signifies that
RPS27L, like p21, is required for efficient DNA damage cell cycle
checkpoint in G1 phase. In addition, RPS27L-depleted HCT116 cells
exhibited a substantial accumulation of cells with a hyperploid
DNA content (>4N) compared with the control cells (30% versus
10.5%). This feature, however, was not observed in p21-depleted
cells (Fig. 6B).
A deficient DNA damage checkpoint is expected to increase DNA
damage. g-H2AX foci are considered to be sensitive indicators of
double-strand breaks, and in p21-deficient cells, DNA damage-
induced H2AX foci remains elevated after DNA-damaging agents
have been removed (38). We next looked at g-H2AX focus
formation after VP16 treatment and monitored the reversibility
post-VP16 washout in RPS27L or p21 shRNA cells. Figure 6C shows
that 1-h treatment with VP16 induced prominent double-strand
break foci, as evidenced by strong g-H2AX staining. In control
cells, g-H2AX staining was decreased over time, and by 16 h after
VP16 removal, the g-H2AX staining was almost undetectable,
suggesting a proficient DNA repair process in these cells. In
contrast, both p21-depleted or RPS27L-depleted HCT116 cells
displayed a sustained g-H2AX staining up to 16 h after VP16
removal, pointing to the increased DNA damage or delayed repair
in these cells. These results further support our hypothesis of a
protective role for RPS27L in DNA damage response.
To examine DNA damage directly, we next used the comet assay.
The comet assay is a single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, in which
damaged DNA migrates to form a ‘‘comet tail’’ that is proportional
to the amount of DNA damage (39). HCT116 control, p21 shRNA,
and RPS27L shRNA cells were incubated with Adriamycin for
24 h, and cells were harvested and processed for the comet assay.
As shown in Fig. 6D , Adriamycin-induced DNA damage was
significantly enhanced in RPS27L-depleted cells and, to a lesser
extent, in p21-deficent cells. Moreover, we observed increased
micronucleus frequency in both RPS27L-depleted and p21-depleted
cells upon Adriamycin treatment, as evaluated by micronuclei
assay, which proves to be a reliable indicator of chromosomal
damage and genomic instability (Fig. 6D ; refs. 29, 40). Overall, these
experiments support that the loss of RPS27L leads to increased
DNA damage upon Adriamycin treatment. We propose that the
induction of RPS27L by p53 facilitates cell cycle checkpoint and
chromosome stability at least in part through promoting p21
accumulation. Collectively, these functions effectively protect
against the DNA damage response.
Discussion
In this study, we identify the RPS27L protein as a novel p53
transcriptional target participating in DNA damage response.
Importantly, we showed its functional role in DNA damage as
protective and it antagonizes the p53-mediated apoptotic response.
Depletion of RPS27L-sensitized cells to DNA-damaging chemo-
therapeutic agents by converting p53 response from growth arrest
to apoptosis. Interestingly, p53-dependent RPS27L protein level
induction depended on the type of genotoxic stress. Whereas its
induction in Adriamycin-treated cells was associated with the cell
cycle arrest response, its decrease upon 5-FU treatment correlated
with a strong apoptosis. RPS27L therefore might function as a
control switch to determine cell fate after p53 activation. The
reason for RPS27L protein down-regulation after 5-FU treatment is
not clear, but it must occur at the posttranscriptional levels
because its mRNA level is up-regulated after 5-FU treatment. The
detailed mechanism for this regulation needs to be further
investigated.
While this manuscript was in preparation, He et al. reported a
similar finding indicating RPS27L as a novel p53 target that
regulates apoptosis upon DNA damage (41). However, the data
contrast with our findings, showing that RPS27L function as a
proapoptotic molecule that mediates p53-induced apoptosis in
etoposide (VP16)-treated HCT116 cells. In He and Sun’s study, high
doses of VP16 (50–200 Amol/L) was used to induce apoptosis in
HCT116 cells. It is well known that DNA-damaging agents, such as
Adriamycin and VP16, at low doses would induce p53-dependent

cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis in HCT116 cells. p53/ cells,
due to lack of p53-p21 induction for G1 cell cycle checkpoint, are
more sensitive to DNA-damaging response (16). When given in
high doses, VP16 would induce apoptosis in HCT116 cells, but
apoptosis induced under this condition does not depend on p53,
as similar levels of apoptosis were induced in both p53 wild-type
and p53/ HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although these
authors found that RPS27L knockdown reduced the apoptosis
rate, despite modestly, in HCT116 cells treated with high doses of
VP16, they did not show the p53 dependence of this effect.
Therefore, the discordant findings between the two studies might
be due to the different doses of VP16 used in the study. In fact, we
do not agree that the phenotype change under the high doses of
VP16 in HCT116 cells is relevant to p53. Nevertheless, our studies
by integrating with different aspects of analysis using valid p53-
dependent cellular models, combined with mechanistic insights,
clearly argue the functional role of RPS27L as an antiapoptotic
molecule in DNA damage response.
p21 has been suggested to be critical in determining cellular
sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, as p21-deficient cells are
defective in the cell cycle checkpoint and are highly sensitive to
DNA damage (18). In addition to transcriptional regulation by p53,
p21 expression can also be regulated through posttranscriptional
mechanisms, either through protein translation or protein
stability. Inhibiting p21 transcription through Myc overexpression
leads to conversion of DNA damage p53 response from growth
arrest to apoptosis (25). The mTOR inhibitor RAD001 has been
shown to sensitize cells to DNA damage–induced apoptosis
through interference with p21 protein translation (26). The same
effect can also be achieved by inhibiting p21 protein stability
through knockdown of the p21-binding protein WISp39 (27). The
concurrent induction of both RPS27L and p21 by p53 seems to
serve as a novel mechanism to sustain p21 protein increase and
to maintain an effective defensive mechanism against the DNA
damage response. Although the underlying mechanism by which
RPS27L regulates p21 protein expression remains to be deter-
mined, our preliminary data suggests that this regulation is not
through direct interaction with p21 and might be involved in
other mechanisms.
p53 is a multifunctional transcriptional factor which induces
many target genes. Depending on the cellular context, p53
activation can induce DNA repair (e.g., by induction of XPC and
p53R2), cell cycle arrest (e.g., by induction by p21), or apoptosis
(e.g., by induction of Bax and Puma). In addition to the role of
RPS27L in regulating cell cycle checkpoint through p21 as we
presented in this study, RPS27L also forms damage foci and
colocalizes with H2Ag or ATM upon DNA damage. This feature
distinguishes RPS27L from p21 and indicates that RPS27L might
have additional functions in regulating DNA damage response. In
addition, RPS27L induction by p53 seemed to be required to
prevent tetraploidy upon DNA damage. Loss of the tetraploidy
checkpoint due to a missing cell cycle arrest has been believed to
contribute to the genomic instability induced by p53 inactivation
(42, 43). Thus, it raises the possibility that RPS27L might also have
a role in maintaining genome stability upon DNA damage. This
feature on tetraploidy regulation seemed to be also independent
of its effect on p21, as p21-deficient cells seemed to have no such
effect. These functions of RPS27L, along with its role in cell cycle
control through regulation of p21, may suggest a role for the
protein in a highly effective DNA repair mechanism in cell cycle–
arrested cells, protecting these cells against DNA damage–induced
apoptosis and placing RPS27L in the p53 pathway, which
determines cell fate in response to DNA damage.
In conclusion, our findings identify a novel p53 target that
participates in DNA damage response and plays an important role
in regulating cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and chromosome
stability. In particular, it points to a novel mechanism in regulation
of p21. Given that DNA damage induces apoptosis rather than cell
cycle arrest in the absence of RPS27L, RPS27L seems to be a critical
determinant of the cellular outcome of p53 activation. Therefore,
RPS2L could be a promising pharmacologic target for modulating
sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.
