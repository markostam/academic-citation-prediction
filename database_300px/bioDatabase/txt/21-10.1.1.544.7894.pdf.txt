ABSTRACT
Intramolecular G-quadruplexes formed by the
human telomeric G-rich strand are promising
anticancer targets. Here we show that four-repeat
human telomeric DNA sequences can adopt two
different intramolecular G-quadruplex folds in K1
solution. The two structures contain the (311)
G-tetrad core, in which three G-tracts are oriented
in one direction and the fourth in the opposite
direction, with one double-chain-reversal and
two edgewise loops, but involve different loop
arrangements. This result indicates the robustness
of the (311) core G-quadruplex topology, thereby
suggesting it as an important platform for structure-
based drug design. Our data also support the view
that multiple human telomeric G-quadruplex con-
formations coexist in K1 solution. Furthermore,
even small changes to flanking sequences can
perturb the equilibrium between different coexisting
G-quadruplex forms.
INTRODUCTION
Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, are impor-
tant for chromosome stability (1–3). Human telomeric
DNA, 4–14 kb long (4), is composed of (TTAGGG/
CCCTAA)n repeats, with a 100–200 nt G-rich strand

overhang at 30 ends (5–7). Telomerase, an enzyme that can
elongate this strand, is not activated in normal human somatic
cells, but highly expressed in 80–85% cancer cells and helps
to maintain the length of telomeres in these cells (8). G-rich
sequences can form G-quadruplex structures (9–11) stabilized
by cations such as Na+ or K+. Intramolecular G-quadruplexes
formed by the human telomeric G-rich strand are promising
anticancer targets (1–3), as formation of such structures has
been shown to inhibit the activity of telomerase (12–14).
The structure of intramolecular human telomeric
G-quadruplexes is the subject of intense research (15–33)
but still puzzling. Until recently only Na+ solution (15) and
K+-containing crystal (16) structures were available and
these structures are very different from each other. In the
former structure (15), guanines around each tetrad are
synsynantianti, loops are successively edgewise–diagonal–
edgewise and each G-tract has both a parallel and an antipar-
allel adjacent strands. In contrast, the crystal structure in the
presence of K+ revealed a completely different intramolecular
G-quadruplex (16), in which all strands are parallel, guanines
are anti and loops are double-chain-reversal. Because K+ is
much more abundant than Na+ in cellular environments, the
structure of telomeric G-quadruplexes in K+ solution is
most important. Data from many laboratories (17–33) indi-
cated the presence of a mixture of several G-quadruplex
forms in K+ solution. Recently, we (34) and others (35,36)
reported the folding topology of an intramolecular human
telomeric G-quadruplex (Form 1) in K+ solution, with our
group also reporting on its solution structure (34). This
so-called (3+1) G-quadruplex involves the following: one
antisynsynsyn and two synantiantianti G-tetrads; one
double-chain-reversal loop formed by the first TTA linker
and two other edgewise loops; three G-tracts oriented in
one direction and the fourth in the opposite direction. Here
we report on a new intramolecular human telomeric G-
quadruplex in K+ solution. Intriguingly, this structure con-
tains the same (3+1) core but differs from Form 1 by loop
arrangements.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

synthesizer and purified by HPLC (17). They were dialyzed
successively against 50 mM KCl solution and against
water. The strand concentration of the NMR samples was
typically 0.5–5 mM; the solutions contained 70 mM KCl
and 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7).
NMR spectroscopy
Experiments were performed on 600 MHz Varian and
800 MHz Bruker spectrometers at 25C. Resonances
were assigned unambiguously by using site-specific
low-enrichment labeling and through-bond correlations
at natural abundance (37–39). Experiments in H2O used
the jump-and-return (JR) water suppression (39,40) for
detection.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Favoring a new G-quadruplex conformation
We systematically examined NMR spectra of human telom-
eric sequences (21–27 nt) containing four G-tracts and
found that in all cases there were mixtures of multiple
G-quadruplexes in K+ solution. However, certain spectral
patterns could be recognized (Figure 1), which were appar-
ently characteristic for different G-quadruplex forms, and
the ratio between these forms varied among sequences
(Figure 1). Possibly, some terminal residues could favor or
disfavor a particular form by interacting with the loops
(34). Indeed, NMR spectra (Figure 2) suggested that the
25-nt human telomeric d[TAGGG(TTAGGG)3TT] sequence
adopts predominantly (70%) a G-quadruplex in K+ solution,

which is different from Form 1, the major form of the 23-nt
human telomeric d[TAGGG(TTAGGG)3] sequence reported
previously (34).
Determination of G-quadruplex folding topology
Sharp linewidths (2–3 Hz for the sharpest peaks at 25C) of
the major form of this 25-nt sequence are consistent with a
monomeric intramolecular G-quadruplex. Guanine imino
protons were unambiguously assigned by the site-specific
low-enrichment approach (37) using 2% 15N-labeled samples
(Figure 3). Guanine H8 protons were assigned by natural-
abundant through-bond correlations (38) to the already
assigned imino protons (Figure 4). Some H8 proton assign-
ments were independently confirmed in site-specific 2%
15N-labeled samples (37) (data not shown). Specific NOEs
between imino and H8 protons (Figure 5a, c and d),
established the fold (Form 2) of this G-quadruplex
(Figure 5e), involving three G-tetrads: G3G21G15G11,
G4G10G16G22 and G5G9G17G23. The third linker
T18-T19-A20 forms a double-chain-reversal loop, while
the two other linkers T6-T7-A8 and T12-T13-A14 form
edgewise loops. The G-tetrad core is of (3+1)-type
(34,41–43), in which three G-tracts are oriented in one direc-
tion and the fourth in the opposite direction. The glycosidic
conformations of the top G-tetrad are antisynsynsyn,
those of the two others are synantiantianti, consistent
with H10-H8 NOE intensities observed for these residues
(Figure 5b). This G-quadruplex fold is also consistent with
other NOEs, such as the rectangular H8–H10 patterns (44)
(Figure 5b) of four 50-syn-anti-30 steps in the structure
(Figure 5e). The G-quadruplex fold was supported by proton
exchange data, which showed that imino protons of the
central G-tetrad are the most protected from exchange with
water (Figure 3b).
Comparison with related G-quadruplex structures
Like Form 1, Form 2 human telomeric G-quadruplex
observed in K+ solution here (Figure 5e) is very different
from the structures observed in Na+ solution or in a
K+-containing crystal, in terms of strand orientations, loop
topologies and glycosidic conformations of guanines.
Form 2 (Figure 6a) differs from Form 1 (Figure 6b) by
loop arrangements: the double-chain-reversal loop is formed
by the third linker instead of the first linker. The folding
topology of Form 2 is similar to the (3+1) G-quadruplex
formed by the four-repeat Tetrahymena telomeric sequence
(42) and by a variant sequence of four G-tracts from the
human bcl-2 promoter (43). The three-repeat human telom-
eric sequence adopts a (3+1) G-quadruplex with yet another
loop arrangement (41).
Possible intramolecular (3+1) G-quadruplexes
Figure 6 shows four possible intramolecular human telomeric
(3+1) G-quadruplexes, in which the 50 end starts from differ-
ent corners of the same G-tetrad core. It is worth mentioning
that NMR spectra of the human telomeric d[TAGGG(T-
TAGGG)3TT] sequence show a downfield-shifted peak for
A20(H8-H10) of Form 2 together with two other downfield-
shifted minor A(H8-H10) peaks (red box, Figure 5b), which
are characteristic of an adenine in the double-chain-reversal
TTA loop (34). It is likely that the latter belong to minor
species that contain double-chain-reversal loops, such as the
parallel-stranded G-quadruplex observed in a K+-containing
crystal (16) or possibly different (3+1) G-quadruplex
conformations shown in Figure 6.
CONCLUSION
We have determined the folding topology of a new
intramolecular G-quadruplex conformation of the human
telomere in K+ solution. Taken together with recent findings
(34–36), this work has established that four-repeat human
telomeric sequences can form two intramolecular (3+1)
G-quadruplexes in K+ solution, which differ from each
other only by the order of loop arrangements. This indicates
the robustness of the (3+1) core G-quadruplex topology, first
reported a decade ago (42), thereby suggesting it as an impor-
tant platform for structure-based drug design. The presence of
a mixture of multiple G-quadruplexes and the differential
effects of terminal residues (or possible attached dyes) on
the stability of different forms should be considered when
one studies telomeric G-quadruplexes.
