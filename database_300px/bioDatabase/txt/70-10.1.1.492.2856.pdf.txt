ABSTRACT
mRNA polyadenylation is a critical cellular process
in eukaryotes. It involves 30 end cleavage of nasc-
ent mRNAs and addition of the poly(A) tail, which
plays important roles in many aspects of the cellular
metabolism of mRNA. The process is controlled by
various cis-acting elements surrounding the clea-
vage site, and their binding factors. In this study,
we surveyed genome regions containing cleavage
sites [herein called poly(A) sites], for 13 942 human
and 11 155 mouse genes. We found that a great pro-
portion of human and mouse genes have alternative
polyadenylation (54 and 32%, respectively). The
conservation of alternative polyadenylation type or
polyadenylation configuration between human and
mouse orthologs is statistically significant, indi-
cating that alternative polyadenylation is widely
employed by these two species to produce alterna-
tive gene transcripts. Genes belonging to several
functional groups, indicated by their Gene Onto-
logy annotations, are biased with respect to poly-
adenylation configuration. Many poly(A) sites harbor
multiple cleavage sites (51.25% human and 46.97%
mouse sites), leading to heterogeneous 30 end forma-
tion for transcripts. This implies that the cleavage
process of polyadenylation is largely imprecise.
Different types of poly(A) sites, with regard to their
relative locations in a gene, are found to have distinct
nucleotide composition in surrounding genomic
regions. This large-scale study provides important
insights into the mechanism of polyadenylation in
mammalian species and represents a genomic view
of the regulation of gene expression by alternative
polyadenylation.
INTRODUCTION
The 30 ends of all fully processed eukaryotic mRNAs (except
most histone genes) have a poly(A) tail. Poly(A) tails have
been shown to influence mRNA stability, translation and trans-
port (1–3). As has been understood more thoroughly in recent
years, 30 end formation is interconnected to other transcrip-
tional and post-transcriptional processes, such as splicing and
transcriptional termination (4–7). The cellular process of mak-
ing poly(A) tails, called polyadenylation, is a two-step reaction
(8–12), first involving specific endonucleolytic cleavage at a
site determined by binding of polyadenylation factors. The
second step involves polymerization of the adenosine tail to
a length specific to the species, e.g. 150–250 in mammals
and 55–90 in yeasts (13). Since the cleavage can be impre-
cise (14,15), resulting in mRNAs with variable ends, we refer
to the cleavage site as a location where mRNA cleavage takes
place, and poly(A) site as a region containing cleavage site(s)
(Figure 1A). It should be pointed out that this variable 30 end
formation is different than alternative polyadenylation involv-
ing multiple polyadenylation sites, which is discussed below.
When multiple cleavage sites exist in a single poly(A) site, the
location of the first (or 50-most) cleavage site is used to repre-
sent the location of the poly(A) site. In addition, terminal
sequence is referred to as a genomic sequence (300 to
+300 nt) containing a poly(A) site (Figure 1A).
It has been reported that over 29% of human genes have
more than one polyadenylation site (16). Alternative poly(A)
sites can be located in the last or 30-most exon, usually giving
rise to mRNAs with variable 30-untranslated regions (30-
UTRs), or in different exons, which can lead to mRNAs
with variable 30-UTRs as well as distinct protein products
(17). Here, we use polyadenylation configuration to refer to
the type of alternative polyadenylation (Figure 1B). As
30-UTRs often include crucial sequence elements important
for mRNA stability, mRNA localization and protein transla-
tion, the effect of alternative polyadenylation is multifold. The
impact of alternative polyadenylation on protein variants

has also been studied for a number of genes (17). It is generally
believed that the choice of polyadenylation site is related to
tissue types and development stages (12,14,17). A well-known
example of alternative polyadenylation is the IgM heavy chain
gene (18). During B lymphocyte activation, IgM heavy chain
gene switches from using one poly(A) site to another, resulting
in a shift in protein production from the membrane-bound
form to the secreted form due to the deletion of a C-terminal
hydrophobic region responsible for membrane interaction.
This switch is an essential step in immune response.
The choice of a particular poly(A) site probably involves
specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors. The
terminal sequence of most mammalian genes contains the
consensus AAUAAA hexamer (or a close variant) between
10 and 30 nucleotides upstream of the actual cleavage site,
which serves as the binding site for the cleavage and
polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). It has been called
polyadenylation signal (PAS), upstream core element or
AAUAAA motif. Here, we use PAS to denote this element.
Several studies on PAS suggested that while most human
polyadenylation sites contain the canonical AAUAAA
(70%), a large portion of genes have single-nucleotide var-
iants, with AUUAAA as the most common one (16,19,20). In
addition, U-rich or U/G-rich elements that are located 20–40 nt
downstream of the cleavage site are involved in directing
polyadenylation by serving as the binding site for the cleavage
stimulation factor (CstF). Together, the PAS and the CstF
binding site are thought to determine the polyadenylation
reaction. In addition, some auxiliary elements upstream of
the PAS and downstream of the cleavage site have been char-
acterized that can enhance polyadenylation efficiency in both
viral and cellular systems (21–27). In general, the nucleotide
composition surrounding human poly(A) site is U-rich (28),
and can be used to computationally predict poly(A) sites,
indicating the importance of the nucleotide composition of
regions harboring poly(A) sites in polyadenylation (28,29).
In this study, we have surveyed a large number of human
and mouse polyadenylation sites, delineated their configura-
tions in the context of the genomic structure of genes, and
studied the conservation of polyadenylation configuration
between human and mouse orthologs. We have also invest-
igated human and mouse PAS hexamers, heterogeneity of
polyadenylation cleavage, the relationship between gene
function and polyadenylation configuration, and nucleotide
composition surrounding various types of poly(A) sites.
This comprehensive study will shed light on the understanding
of alternative polyadenylation in mammalian species, and pro-
vide insights into the mechanisms of mRNA polyadenylation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Align cDNA/ESTs to genomic sequences
We used all sequences listed in human and mouse UniGene
databases (NCBI, March, 2004 versions) that are associated
with LocusLink IDs, and aligned them to genome sequences
(human genome Build 34.2 and mouse genome Build 32, both
from NCBI). RefSeq mRNA and cDNA sequences (NCBI
GenBank March, 2004 release) and ESTs (NCBI dbEST
March, 2004 release) were aligned to genomes using
BLAST and MegaBLAST suites with default settings (J. Hu
and B. Tian, unpublished data). Briefly, MegaBLAST was first
used to find the genomic location of a sequence, and BLAST
was used to fill gaps left behind by MegaBLAST. In both steps,
high scoring pairs (HSPs) were assembled using the Longest
Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm (30) with a modifica-
tion on the calculation of sequence length (J. Hu and B. Tian,
unpublished data). Exon ends were located by using scoring
matrices for canonical and non-canonical splicing sites (31) at
the 50 and 30 ends of assembled HSPs. The results were com-
parable to those obtained from using BLAT (32) (data not
shown). The transcriptional orientation of a sequence on the
genome was first determined by its splicing sites, e.g. GT.AG
(50 and 30 splice sites, respectively) indicates a sense orienta-
tion whereas CT.AC indicates an anti-sense orientation, and/or
its poly(A) tail (see below) since polyadenylation only occurs
at the 30 end. If the orientation of a sequence indicated by
Figure 1. (A) Schematic representation of a poly(A) site and polyadenylation
configuration. In this study, a poly(A) site is a region containing cleavage
site(s) (arrowed lines). The 50-most cleavage site is the reference point
(position 0) for the poly(A) site. Thus, the genomic location of a poly(A)
site is represented by the location of the 50-most cleavage site it contains.
The sequence 300 to +300 is defined as a terminal sequence. The sites for
CPSF and CstF are also depicted. (B) Three types of polyadenylation
configuration. A type 1 gene has a single poly(A) site; a type II gene has
alternative poly(A) sites all located in the 30-most exon; and a type III gene
has alternative poly(A) sites located in different exons. Types of poly(A) sites
are also marked. 1S, a single poly(A) site; 2F, the 50-most poly(A) site in a type
II gene; 2L, the 30-most poly(A) site in a type II gene; 2M, a middle poly(A) site
between 2F and 2L in a type II gene; 3U, a poly(A) site located upstream of the
30-most exon; and 3S, a single site in the 30-most exon of a type III gene. Not
shown in the graph are 3F, 3M and 3L, which are similar to 2F, 2M and 2L,
respectively, except that the formers are located in the 30-most exon of a type III
gene. Exons are represented as boxes; pA, poly(A) site.

splicing is in conflict with that by its poly(A) tail, the sequence
is discarded. If neither piece of information can be obtained
from a sequence, which automatically indicates that the
sequence does not have a poly(A) tail (thus not of interest
in this study), the sequence is also discarded.
In this study, genes are represented by LocusLink entries,
which were obtained from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/
LocusLink/). RefSeq mRNA sequences were used to represent
transcripts of genes. If a gene has more than one RefSeq
sequence, their corresponding genomic regions are required
to overlap, and their transcriptional orientations are required to
be the same. Genes whose RefSeq sequences do not meet these
two criteria are discarded. Thus each gene’s orientation and
genomic location can be unequivocally determined using its
RefSeq(s). cDNA/ESTs that are associated with a gene, as
listed in the UniGene database, are required to meet the fol-
lowing criteria: (i) A sequence’s transcriptional orientation is
required to be in agreement with that of its associated gene.
(ii) The genomic regions aligned with a cDNA/EST are
required to overlap with those of RefSeq sequences of its
corresponding gene by either a 32 nt sequence or an entire
exon (either the cDNA/EST’s or RefSeq’s). This is to elim-
inate sequences incorrectly associated with LocusLink IDs in
the UniGene database. Also, it discards sequences that reside
in the intron region of other genes.
For each gene, the 30-most intron/exon junction of its
RefSeqs is arbitrarily defined as the gene’s 30-most intron/
exon junction. Thus a gene’s 30-most exon is determined by
its RefSeqs. The stop codon of a gene is located using the
RefSeq GenBank annotation file. If a gene has more than one
stop codon, the 30-most is used.
Poly(A) site determination
cDNA/EST sequences aligned to genomic sequences were
examined for poly(A) tails after the alignment. Unaligned
sequences at both 50 and 30 termini of the cDNA/EST
were checked for a stretch of T and A, respectively. For the
30 end, a sequence is considered to have a poly(A) tail if after
the unaligned position (i) the sequence contains 8 or more
consecutive As, or (ii) if it has one other nucleotide, it has
8 or more consecutive As after the other nucleotide. The
criteria are the same for the 50 end except that consecutive
Ts are searched.
For sequences that contain poly(A) tails, the poly(A) clea-
vage site on the genome is considered to be right after the 30-
most position of the alignment of cDNA/EST with the
genome. To address the internal priming issue, the genomic
sequence 10 to +10 nt surrounding the cleavage site was
examined. If the sequence has six continuous As or more than
7 As in a 10 nt window, it is considered as internal priming
candidate, similar to what was used by other groups (16,33).
However, if an internal priming candidate site is supported by
more than one cDNA/EST and has one of the 12 PAS
hexamers in 40 to 1 nt region (16), it is believed to be
a real site. Because of the heterogeneity of polyadenylation
cleavage, we iteratively clustered poly(A) cleavage sites that
are located next to each other within 24 nt, i.e. starting from the
50-most one, the process of clustering cleavage sites is con-
tinued until no adjacent cleavages sites are located within
24 nt. We used the 50-most cleavage site of a set of clustered
sites as the reference site for a poly(A) site. The number
of cDNA/ESTs associated with a poly(A) site is the sum
of all cDNA/ESTs supporting its constituent cleavage
sites. After clustering of cleavage sites, if a poly(A) site has
at least two supporting cDNA/EST sequences, or has a
PAS hexamer (AAUAAA or 11 variants) in the 40 to 1
region of the poly(A) site, it is considered to be a genuine
poly(A) site.
Identification of PAS
We used a method developed by Beaudoing et al. (16) to
identify PAS. Briefly, the most frequently occurring hexamer
in the 40 to 1 region of all poly(A) sites is detected, and
sequences containing the hexamer are removed. The process is
repeated until less than 5% of sequences are remaining.
Conservation study of human and mouse
orthologous genes
Human and mouse orthologous genes were obtained from
HomoloGene database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/).
Only reciprocal best BLAST hits of protein sequences were
used. Pearson’s c2-test was used to determine the conservation
of polyadenylation configuration between orthologs. Expected
values were obtained by the c2-test function in the R program
(http://www.r-project.org/).
Gene Ontology analysis
Gene Ontology annotations of genes were obtained from the
LocusLink database of NCBI. The full list of GO terms in three
categories, namely Biological Process (BP), Cellular Compo-
nent (CC) and Molecular Function (MF), was downloaded
from Gene Ontology Consortium website (http://www.
geneontology.org/). For each GO term, all associated GO
terms were found by a recursive method which searches the
whole gene ontology tree for related entries through either ‘is
a’ or ‘part of’ relationship. A total number of 7315 GO terms
(3607 BP, 690 CC and 3039 MF) were found to be associated
with 9057 human and 7700 mouse genes. Fisher’s exact test
using 2 · 2 table was applied to assess the bias of polyade-
nylation configuration for each GO term. In the table, two
columns are constitutive polyadenylation and alternative poly-
adenylation, and two rows are ‘having the GO term’ and ‘not
having the GO term’. The test for type III gene was carried out
in a similar manner except that one column is ‘is a type III
gene’, and the other is ‘is not a type III gene’. The Benjamini
and Hochberg method was applied to eliminate false positives
generated as a result of multiple testing (34).
Heat map and two-way clustering of poly(A) site
types and PAS hexamers
Heat map was generated by the image function in R (35).
Hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance was used
to make dendrograms.
Sequence analysis of poly(A) sites
For each poly(A) site, terminal sequence 300 to +300 nt
neighboring the cleavage site was obtained from the genome.
If a cleavage site is located less than 300 nt from the end of a
genome contig, the sequence between the cleavage site and the
end of the contig is used.

RESULTS
Mapping poly(A) sites on human and mouse genomes
The availability of human and mouse nearly complete
genomic sequences and a large number of their respective
cDNA and EST sequences (herein collectively called
cDNA/EST, the difference being that an EST is usually a
partial sequence of a transcript and a cDNA is usually full-
length) provide an unprecedented opportunity to study poly-
adenylation. Using a series of databases from NCBI, including
UniGene, LocusLink, RefSeq, dbEST and GenBank databases
(see Materials and Methods), we mapped a large number of
human and mouse poly(A) sites on the genomes (Table 1). We
took a gene-centered approach by using LocusLink entries to
represent genes and their associated RefSeq mRNAs to repre-
sent transcripts. cDNA/ESTs are then mapped to RefSeq
sequences.
We identified 67 440 cleavage sites that are supported by
cDNA/ESTs for 29 283 poly(A) sites in 13 942 human genes,
and 31 179 cleavage sites for 16 282 poly(A) sites in 11 155
mouse genes. This mapping is by far the most comprehensive
to date to the best of our knowledge. The average poly(A) sites
per gene is 2.1 for human genes and 1.5 for mouse genes.
The difference between human and mouse figures is mainly
attributable to the fact that there are fewer cDNA/EST
sequences for mouse genes and a smaller proportion of
them have poly(A) tails (11% human cDNA/ESTs versus
4% mouse cDNA/ESTs), resulting in human genes having
3.7 times as many poly(A) tail-containing cDNA/ESTs
than mouse genes (Table 1).
The distribution of the genomic distance between adjacent
poly(A) sites in a gene, when multiple sites are present, shows
two modes (Figure 2A), with one peak at300 nt and the other
at 14 kb for human genes (mouse genes show similar dis-
tribution, see Supplementary Materials). These two modes
appear to correspond to alternative poly(A) sites located in
the 30-most exon and alternative poly(A) sites located in dif-
ferent exons, respectively. This is based on the observation
that when we only used poly(A) sites located in the 30-most
exon defined by RefSeq sequences (see Materials and
Methods), we could see a single-mode distribution similar
to the left peak in Figure 2A (Figure 2B). The distance
between adjacent poly(A) sites in the 30-most exon has a
median value of 288 nt for human genes and 345 nt for
mouse genes. The distance between the stop codon of a
gene to its closest downstream poly(A) site has a median
value of 324 nt for human genes (Figure 2C), and 385 nt
for mouse genes (Supplementary Figure 2C).

We studied PAS in the40 to1 region upstream of poly(A)
sites using a method developed by Beaudoing et al. (16). As
shown in Table 2, top occurring PAS hexamers for human and
mouse poly(A) sites are very similar in their frequency, with the
top five hexamers having identical ranks. AAUAAA and
11 single nucleotide variants are prominent hexamers detected.
UUUAAA is the most frequent hexamer among other
hexamers. The frequencies of top PAS hexamers of human
poly(A) sites are similar to those reported by Beaudoing
et al., with the exception of AAGAAA, whose occurrence is
higher in our result. Thus in this study, we focused on
AAUAAA and 11 single nucleotide variants, which are
associated with 92% human and 93% mouse poly(A) sites.
Heterogeneity of cleavage sites
We found that a large number of poly(A) sites have more than
one cleavage site, as also noted before by other groups (14,15).
Specifically, 51.25% of human and 46.97% mouse poly(A)
sites have more than one cleavage site; and human poly(A)
sites have an average of 2.30 cleavage sites per poly(A) site
with SD of 1.91, and mouse sites have an average of 1.92 with
SD of 1.33. In either case, the distribution of the number of
cleavage sites per poly(A) site is not normal (Gaussian). In
fact, if we do not cluster adjacent cleavage sites, the histogram
of the distance between adjacent cleavage sites will give rise to
three modes (Figure 3A), with the first mode (the first peak in
Figure 3A) corresponding to the distance between heteroge-
neous cleavage sites. The other two modes are similar to the
two peaks derived from alternative poly(A) sites shown in
Figure 2A. Since there is a valley at 24 nt between the
first and second modes, derived from the fitted density line
(Figure 3A), we therefore iteratively clustered all cleavage
sites located within 24 nt next to each other. When there
are multiple cleavage sites in a poly(A) site, the distance
between the 50-most cleavage site and other ones after cluster-
ing is shown in Figure 2B. Since the majority (>95%) of the
distances are below 24 nt, we conclude that the heterogeneity
of poly(A) cleavage usually occurs within 24 nt after the
50-most cleavage site.
To study the mechanism leading to this heterogeneity, we
studied PAS and supporting cDNA/ESTs for cleavage sites. We
found that the heterogeneity of mRNA cleavage does not appear
to be a result of multiple PAS upstream of a poly(A) site
(Figure 3C), but seems to correlate with the number of support-
ing cDNA/ESTs that a poly(A) site has (Figure 3D). The
Pearson correlation R is 0.83 for human poly(A) sites and
0.75 for mouse poly(A) sites when both the number of support-
ing cDNA/ESTs and the number of cleavage sites are in loga-
rithmic scales. Therefore, the heterogeneity of cleavage sites is
in general due to stochastic selection of cleavage position. In
other words, the more sequences investigated, the higher the
chance of finding heterogeneous cleavage sites. Since our
method to align cDNA/ESTs with the genomic sequence will
always match the 50-most adenosine of a poly(A) tail to the
genome sequence if the 1 position is an adenosine, we do
not know if there is any nucleotide preference for the cleavage
site, such as the A >U >C >>G order reported previously (36).
For poly(A) sites that are associated with only one PAS, we
measured the distance between the 50-most cleavage site and
the first nucleotide of the PAS (Figure 3E). The median value
is 21 nt, which is in agreement with previous surveys (16,36).
Interestingly, a small population of poly(A) sites are very close
to the PAS. A careful inspection of all 12 PAS hexamers
indicates that they are mainly poly(A) sites associated with
AAGAAA (Supplementary Figure 3), and they are usually
located in exons upstream of the 30-most exon (see below).
Possible biological implications of this finding are provided in
the discussion section.
Widespread alternative polyadenylation in
human and mouse genes
The two-mode distribution of genomic distance between
poly(A) sites (Figure 2A) prompted us to classify genes
according to their poly(A) site location. Edwalds-Gilbert
et al. (17) proposed three types of alternative polyadenylation,
i.e. (i) tandem poly(A) sites, (ii) coupled with composite in/
terminal exons and (iii) coupled with skipped exons. In line
with that, we have classified genes based on their polyadenyla-
tion configuration as delineated in Figure 1B. Genes with only
one poly(A) site are classified as type I genes, genes with multi-
ple poly(A) sites all in the 30-most exon as type II genes, and
genes with multiple poly(A) sites located in different exons as
type III genes. For simplicity, we did not differentiate types B
and C alternative polyadenylation proposed by Edwalds-
Gilbert et al. (17), which result from two distinct mechanisms
of alternative splicing. Instead, they are collectively called type
III genes, where alternative polyadenylation is related to splic-
ing. Thus type I genes have a single constitutive poly(A) site,
whereas types II and III genes have alternative poly(A) sites.
We found that 54% of human genes and 32% of mouse
genes have multiple poly(A) sites (Table 3). These numbers
are significantly higher than that previously thought about the
occurrences of alternative polyadenylation. The difference
between human and mouse figures is at least partially attribu-
table to fewer mouse poly(A) tail-containing cDNA/ESTs than
human ones (Table 1). Nevertheless, the conservation of poly-
adenylation configuration between human and mouse ortho-
logs is statistically significant (P-value of 2.0 · 10132 using a
c2-test; Figure 4). All values for corresponding human and

mouse polyadenylation configurations are more than 1.2-fold
above the expected values, indicating that alternative poly-
adenylation is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process
between human and mouse orthologous genes.
To address the question of whether some functional groups of
genes have biased polyadenylation configuration, we studied
the relationship between gene functions, as indicated by Gene
Ontology (GO) annotations of a gene, and the polyadenylation
configuration. We used genes whose polyadenylation config-
uration is conserved between human and mouse orthologs
(Figure 4). A total number of 7315 GO terms belonging to
three categories were studied, namely biological process, cel-
lular component and molecular function (Table 4). Genes
whose functions are related to cell surface receptor-linked
site transduction (biological process), extracellular genes (cel-
lular component) and site transducer activity (molecular func-
tion) are found to be disproportionately associated with type I
constitutive polyadenylation (Table 4). Genes that are found to
be disproportionately associated with alternative polyadenyla-
tion include those encoding intracellular proteins (cellular com-
ponent), proteins involved in intracellular protein transport
(biological process) and proteins having protein transporter
activity (molecular functions). Thus, it appears that genes
with extracellular protein products tend to have constitutive
polyadenylation sites, whereas genes with intracellular protein
products are biased for alternative polyadenylation. In addition,
genes whose protein products are located in the nucleus and
have RNA-binding activities are found to be disproportionately
associated with type III configuration, i.e. related to splicing.
Characteristics of poly(A) sites of different types
To further characterize poly(A) sites in genes with different
poly(A) configuration, we classified poly(A) sites according to
their location in a gene (Figure 1B). A poly(A) site can be one
of the following nine types: 1S, the single poly(A) site in a type
I gene; 2F, the 50-most poly(A) site in a type II gene; 2L, the 30-
most poly(A) site in a type II gene; 2M, a middle poly(A) site
between 2F and 2L in a type II gene, if it has more than two
sites; 3U, a poly(A) site located upstream of the 30-most exon
in a type III gene, either in the intronic region or exonic region;
3F, the first site in the 30-most exon of a type III gene; 3L, the
30-most site in a type III gene; 3M, a middle poly(A) site
between 3F and 3L, if there are more than two sites in the
30-most exon; and 3S, the single poly(A) site in the 30-most
exon of a type III gene.
We studied the40 to1 region of all types of poly(A) sites
for the usage of 12 types of PAS (16). As shown in Figure 5A,
poly(A) sites of different types use different PAS hexamers to
various extent. For constitutive poly(A) sites (1S), 70% of
them have AAUAAA, 15% have AUUAAA, 12% have other
10 types of PAS hexamers and 4% of them do not have any
known PAS hexamers. Almost an identical pattern is observed
for 3S. Similar usage of PAS is also observed between 2F and
3F, between 2M and 3M, and between 2L and 3L. Overall, nine
types of poly(A) sites appear to fall into two groups according
to the usage of PAS hexamers. One group includes 1S, 2L, 3L
and 3S. They tend to use AAUAAA (>60%) more than other
types of PAS hexamer. The other group includes 2F, 2M, 3F,
3M and 3U, and <50% of the sites of each type contain
AAUAAA, and >35% use PAS hexamers other than
AAUAAA and AUUAAA. Interestingly, the percentage of
sites containing AUUAAA does not vary much (14–19%)
between all types of poly(A) sites, compared to AAUAAA
(38–70%). This grouping is also supported by cluster analysis
using the distribution of PAS hexamers in different types of
poly(A) sites (Figure 5B). PAS hexamers can also be grouped
by a similar manner. Interestingly, AAGAAA seems to be
present in the 3U type more than other non-AUUAAA variants.
Indeed, if we set the total number of poly(A) site for each PAS
hexamer to 100%, we can see a more conspicuous presence of
AAGAAA in 3U (data not shown).

This grouping is in agreement with the notion that the 30-
most poly(A) sites usually are the ‘strongest’ site among all
sites in a gene (28). Further supporting this is the number of
cDNA/EST sequences (Figure 5C). The 30-most poly(A) site
of a gene, such as 2L, 3L and 3S, has a greater number of
supporting cDNA/EST sequences than other types of poly(A)
sites. The difference is expected to be even larger if only non-
normalized cDNA libraries are used. Owing to the correlation
between the number of supporting cDNA/ESTs and the num-
ber of cleavage sites, a similar pattern is observed, as expected,
when we investigated the number of cleavage sites per poly(A)
site for different types of poly(A) sites (Figure 5D). Approxi-
mately 70% of 1S and 3S poly(A) sites have more than one
cleavage site; 55% for 2L and 3L; 45–49% for 2F, 2M, 3F
and 3M; and only 20% for 3U.
This result indicates that the predominant form of an mRNA
sequence is usually the longest one, generated by the 30-most
poly(A) site, and alternative polyadenylation is employed to
shorten the mRNA. The exact implications of this mode of
regulation may differ from gene to gene as sequences in the
regulated region may contain cis elements involved in various
aspects of RNA metabolism, such as RNA localization, trans-
lation and RNA stability.
We next examined the nucleotide composition of the
genomic sequence of poly(A) sites. For each poly(A) site, we
selected terminal sequences spanning 300 to +300 nt
surrounding the cleavage site (Figure 6). For poly(A) sites of
all types, the 100 to +100 region has different nucleotide
composition than regions upstream (<100) or downstream
(>+100) of the cleavage site. Invariably, within this window,
it is U-rich, as reported previously (28), with a peak at around
+20, which is generally known as the CstF-binding sites. The
region40 to10 is A-rich, which causes a drop in U content.
This region coincideswith the region containing PAShexamers.
In spite of similarities in 100 to +100 region, there are
conspicuous differences between poly(A) sites of different
types. Poly(A) sites of 1S and 3S types have similar contents
of GC and AU in regions upstream of 100 and downstream
of +100, whereas other types of poly(A) sites have higher
content of AU than GC in these regions. However, for the
first poly(A) sites in the 30-most exon (2F and 3F), the differ-
ence between AU and GC contents in the upstream region
(300 to 100) is less than that in the downstream region
(+100 to +300). Interestingly, for the 30-most poly(A) sites (2L
and 3L), the downstream region appear to have smaller dif-
ference between AU and GC contents than that of upstream
regions. In other words, the upstream region of the 50-most
alternative poly(A) site and the downstream region of the 30-
most alternative poly(A) site resemble the upstream and down-
stream regions of constitutive sites. In contrast, 3U, 2M and
3M poly(A) sites have similar nucleotide compositions in the
sequence upstream of 100 and the sequence downstream of
+100, and both of them are AU-rich. This AU richness is also
discernible in mouse poly(A) sites, but to a lesser degree
(Supplementary Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
We surveyed a large number of human and mouse genes for
poly(A) sites. Strikingly, we found 54% human genes and
32% of mouse genes have multiple alternative poly(A) sites.
The conservation of polyadenylation configuration between
human and mouse orthologs was found to be statistically sig-
nificant. These two numbers are higher than the 29% obtained
in a previous study for human genes (16). We think this is
mainly attributable to two factors (1). In this study, we used far
more cDNA/ESTs. In Beaudoing and colleagues’ study, they
used 157 775 poly(A) tail containing ESTs for 8775 UTR
sequences. After sequence clean-up, which eliminated
>23% sequences, on average a UTR sequence was supported
by <14 ESTs. In this study, we used 396 908 poly(A) tail
containing cDNA/ESTs (using criteria designed to discard
problematic cDNA/ESTs both at the genome alignment step

and the poly(A) tail identification step; see Materials and
Methods) for 13 942 human genes, giving rise to about 28
supporting cDNA/ESTs per gene. Given the difference
between human and mouse numbers (54% versus 32%),
which is also due to the disparity in the number of supporting
cDNA/EST per gene, the difference between the numbers of
identified poly(A) sites in these two studies is not surprising.
However, we think that most additional poly(A) sites we iden-
tified are probably weak sites that are elusive with small num-
bers of cDNA/ESTs (2). Beaudoing and colleagues took a
UTR-centered approach, where ESTs were mapped to UTR
sequences. UTRs were used to represent mRNAs in order to
find the real 30 end of an mRNA sequence. Therefore,
Beaudoing and colleagues’ study in effect focused on alter-
native polyadenylation happening in the 30-most exon, since
the majority of 30-UTRs are located in the 30-most exon (data
not shown). Here, we used a gene-centered approach, where
cDNA/ESTs were mapped to genomes, which allowed us to
study alternative polyadenylation coupled with splicing. In
fact, if we do not consider poly(A) sites located upstream
of the 30-most exon, the percentage of genes having alternative
polyadenylation will drop by 10% to about 44%. Nevertheless,
both studies found similar percentages of usage of PAS hex-
amers AAUAAA (58.2% in Beaudoing et al. study and 53.2%
in this study) and AUUAAA (14.9% in their study and 17% in
this study). But the percentages of poly(A) sites containing
other types of PAS hexamers and no PAS hexamer differ
between two studies. In Beaudoing et al.’s work, about
15% poly(A) sites contain one of the 10 PAS hexamer var-
iants, and 22% poly(A) sites do not have any PAS hexamer.
These two numbers are 22% and 8% respectively in our
study. The difference is because that in our study, we required
more than one cDNA/EST sequence if there are no PAS
hexamers found.
Our study indicates that alternative polyadenylation is wide-
spread in both humans and mice. In addition, a large number of
human and mouse orthologs have conserved polyadenylation
configuration highlighting its importance in producing vari-
able gene products, i.e. mRNAs and/or proteins. Some groups
of genes are found disproportionately associated with certain
types of poly(A) configuration. While genes encoding extra-
cellular proteins often have single poly(A) sites, and genes
encoding intracellular proteins tend to have alternative
poly(A) sites, the biological implications have yet to be
elucidated. Interestingly, genes encoding RNA binding
proteins tend to have alternative poly(A) sites and are
found disproportionately associated with the type III
polyadenylation configuration, i.e. alternative polyadenylation
coupled with splicing.
Our observation that there are a large number of poly(A)
sites located upstream of the 30-most exon, i.e. 3U type
poly(A) sites, raises an intriguing question as to the role of
this type of alternative polyadenylation in gene regulation.
The biological consequences of this include change of protein
sequence, exemplified by IgM genes, or non-stop mRNA
decay if the resulting transcript lacks a stop codon (37).

An extensive study is needed to delineate the significance of
mRNA polyadenylation upstream of the 30-most exon. Inter-
estingly, the AAGAAA PAS hexamer was found dispropor-
tionately associated with 3U type poly(A) sites. By an
exhaustive hexamer search, AAGAAA as a PAS was found
to be statistically significant (16). However, previous biochem-
ical works have shown that mutating AAUAAA to AAGAAA
could abrogate polyadenylation (22,38). AAGAAA was also
shown to be an exonic splicing enhancer (39). It is possible that
this element can function in both processes. Based on current
knowledge of the relationship between splicing and polyade-
nylation, anattractive model is that there is competition between
splicing factors and polyadenylation factors for binding to
AAGAAA. If splicing factors can compete favorably with poly-
adenylation factors, a splicing will occur which also prevents
adjacent polyadenylation. Likewise, if polyadenylation factors
are successful in binding, polyadenylation will take place
instead of splicing. Since the distance between AAGAAA to
the cleavage site is shorter than that from other types of PAS
hexamers (Supplementary Material), we think the polyadenyla-
tion machinery involved may not be identical to the one
involved in the polyadenylation process in the 30-most exon.
However, this hypothesis will require considerable experimen-
tal evidence to assess its validity.
Heterogeneity of mRNA cleavage was noted experimen-
tally in previous studies for individual genes (15,22,36,40).
Here, using a large-scale survey, we have demonstrated that
51% human and 47% mouse poly(A) sites have more than
one cleavage site. While the heterogeneity is probably not
caused by the presence of multiple PAS hexamers, there
appears to be a correlation between the number of support-
ing cDNA/ESTs and the number of cleavage sites. This
indicates that cleavage site determination could be stochas-
tic, albeit there might be preferences as to the exact clea-
vage position to choose, as shown before in biochemical
assays (36). However, the involvement of other unidentified
cis elements in the poly(A) site in determining cleavage
sites cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, this heterogeneity
indicates the imprecise nature of RNA cleavage carried out
by polyadenylation enzyme complex. In fact, it was sug-
gested that the interaction between the basal polyadenylation
machinery and the mRNA may provide some ‘oppor-
tunities’ for flexibility, regulation and heterogeneity (15,22).
On the other hand, the quality of cDNA/EST sequence also

complicates the situation, as errors occur more often at the
ends of sequences. However, we do not expect this to be a
major factor since an erroneous sequence would have to
perfectly match the genome sequence to be considered in
our study.
Our data showed that different types of poly(A) sites are
surrounded by sequences with distinct nucleotide composi-
tions. In general, the 100 to +100 sequence shows nucleotide
bias for A and U. However, alternative poly(A) sites located
between other poly(A) sites show this high AU content beyond
the 100 to +100 region. This is unlikely to be caused by
adjacent poly(A) sites since the median distance between alter-
native poly(A) sites in the 30-most exon is about 288 nt. Also,
when we used terminal sequences containing only one poly(A)
site (no other poly(A) sites located within 300 nt upstream and
downstream), we still saw this pattern (data not shown). On the
other hand, protein coding sequence, while contributing to the
nucleotide composition of terminal sequences, does not seem
to change the overall trend (Supplementary Figure 6). This is
partly because the median value of the distance between the
stop codon and the first downstream poly(A) site is 324 nt. The
unique AU-rich environment offers an opportunity for harbor-
ing cis elements rich in A and U. A notable example is the
specific AU-rich elements known as AREs, which are respon-
sible for targeting many mammalian mRNAs for rapid decay
(41,42). Numerous proteins have been identified which bind to
these elements. In some cases the protein–RNA interactions
appear to stabilize the mRNA (43–45), while in other cases the
interactions serve to destabilize the mRNA (46). The fact that
an AU-rich region is associated with alternative poly(A) sites
indicate that alternative polyadenylation can adeptly regulate
mRNA stability. However, other cis elements involved in
other aspects of mRNA metabolism can also be located in
this AU-rich region, and thus are subject to alternative regula-
tion by polyadenylation.
