ABSTRACT
The inaccurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) can result in genomic instability, and addi-
tionally cell death or the development of cancer.
Elg1, which forms an alternative RFC-like complex
with RFC2-5, is required for the maintenance of
genome stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
its function has been linked to DNA replication or
damage checkpoint response. Here, we show that
Elg1 is involved in homologous recombination (HR)-
mediated DSB repair. Mutants of elg1 were partially
defective in HR induced by methylmethanesufonate
(MMS) and phleomycin. Deletion of ELG1 resulted
in less efficient repair of phleomycin-induced DSBs
in G2/M phase-arrested cells. During HR between
MAT and HML loci, Elg1 associated with both the
MAT locus near the HO endonuclease-induced DSB
site, and the HML homologous donor locus. The
association of Elg1 with the MAT locus was not
dependent on Rad52. However, Elg1 association
with the HML locus depended on Rad52. Impor-
tantly, we found that two of the later steps in HR-
mediated repair of an HO endonuclease-induced
DSB, primer extension after strand invasion and
ligation, were less efficient in elg1 mutants. Our
results suggest that Elg1 is involved in DSB repair
by HR.
INTRODUCTION
Many overlapping mechanisms of genome surveillance and
DNA repair reside in eukaryotic cells to ensure genome sta-
bility. Genomic instability, which occurs in normal cells at a
low rate, is enhanced in cancer cells. Among the signs of gen-
ome instability observed in many cancer cells are elevated
mutation rates, and gross chromosomal rearrangements,
such as deletions and translocations (1). The yeast Saccharo-
myces cerevisiae, a simple eukaryote, is a useful model
system for studying genome stability, because the basic repair
pathways in yeast, and the regulatory mechanisms that control
them, are well conserved across species. Elg1 (enhanced level
of genome instability) was identified in S.cerevisiae as
a genome stabilizer, and its human counterpart has also been
identified (2–4). Elg1 exhibits sequence similarity to one of
the five subunits of the replication factor C (RFC) complex,
Rfc1, and replaces this subunit in the RFC complex. For this
reason, Elg1-containing RFCs are called alternative RFCs.
RFC was originally identified as a protein complex
required for SV40 DNA replication in vitro, and consists of
five different subunits (RFC1-5 in humans) (5,6). During
DNA replication, the classical RFC complex recognizes pri-
mer termini, and catalyzes loading of the sliding clamp,
which includes proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
onto the DNA, not RNA (7,8). PCNA remains associated
with the DNA, and acts as a processivity factor for DNA
polymerase d on either the lagging and/or leading DNA
strand. At least three alternative forms of the RFC, including
the Elg1-containing complex, have been identified recently in
yeast and humans (2–4). The Rad24–Rfc2-5 complex, in
which Rfc1 is replaced by Rad24 (9), loads a PCNA-like
heterotrimer clamp, consisting of Rad17, Ddc1 and Mec3,
onto the DNA (3,10). Both the Rad24/Rfc2-5 clamp loader
and the Rad17/Ddc1/Mec3 clamp are required for activation
of the DNA damage checkpoint in G1 and G2, and contribute
to S phase checkpoint regulation. A third Rfc1-like protein,
Ctf18, replaces Rfc1 the Ctf18–Rfc2-5 complex (11–13).
Ctf18/Rfc2-5 contains two additional subunits, Ctf8 and
Dcc1, and mutations in any of these three proteins, ctf18,
ctf8, or dcc1, results in defects in sister chromatid cohesion
(11,12), the process by which newly replicated chromatids
remain physically associated until entry into anaphase. More-
over, ctf18 rad24 double mutants have a mild S-M check-
point defect that is not evident in either single mutant, and
have a defect in Rad53 phosphorylation, a hallmark of the
DNA damage response, indicating that Ctf18 also contributes
to the S phase checkpoint response (13). Interestingly,
in vitro, the Ctf18/Rfc2-5 complex can catalyze the loading
and unloading of PCNA (14), however the biological signifi-
cance of this activity is not well understood.
The Elg1–Rfc2-5 complex was recently identified as a
member of the group of alternative RFCs in yeast and

human cells (2–4). Elg1/Rfc2-5 interacts with PCNA (4), but
the PCNA-clamp loading activity of Elg1/Rfc2-5 has not
been demonstrated. In the absence of ELG1, increased rates
of spontaneous recombination were observed during vege-
tative growth in budding yeast (2). Allelic and ectopic intra
and interchromosomal recombination, as well as recombi-
nation between sister chromatids, were elevated in this
mutant (2). A high rate of chromosomal loss, transposition
and mutation, and elevated levels of gross chromosomal rear-
rangements were also detected (2,3,15–17). In addition,
mutations in ELG1 resulted in elongation of telomeres, and
increased silencing of subtelomeric genes (4,18). Mutants
of elg1 are sensitive to methylmethanesufonate (MMS) (3).
In an elg1 ctf18 rad24 triple mutant, MMS-induced Rad53
phosphorylation was completely abolished, whereas it was
intact in the elg1 single mutant (3,4). Thus, it seems likely
that Elg1 is also involved in DNA repair; however this has
yet to be confirmed.
One of the most dangerous DNA lesions is the DSB, which
can be caused by ionizing radiation, or result from replication
over single-strand breaks. When unrepaired, a DSB can cause
permanent cell cycle arrest, and ultimately cell death. Several
distinct mechanisms exist for the repair of DSBs (19,20).
Accurate restoration of DNA broken ends can be achieved
by HR, provided that homologous sequences are present else-
where in the genome (21). In budding yeast, HR depends on
the recombination factors Rad52–Rad51, which initiate the
search for homologous sequences. Alternatively, a DSB can
be repaired by direct ligation in a process termed non-
homologous end-joining (NHEJ). With some exceptions,
NHEJ is mediated by the Ku heterodimer, which binds to
double-stranded DNA ends and facilitates ligation (22).
In the current study, we demonstrated that the repair of
DSBs induced by phleomycin is inefficient in elg1 mutants.
We also showed that in contrast to the high incidence of spon-
taneous recombination in elg1 mutants, the absence of Elg1
did not result in an increase in the incidence of damage-
induced recombination. Our results suggest that Elg1 func-
tions in one or more of the steps of recombination repair
itself. The implications of Elg1 function in homologous
recombination (HR) will be discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Yeast strains
Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. Null mutants, Myc-tagged, and HA-tagged alleles
were made using standard PCR-based gene disruption and
insertion methods, as described previously (23–25). To obtain
the deletion mutants replaced by KANMX6, HPHMX4 and
CgTRP1, these genes were amplified from pFA6aKANMX6,
pAG32 and SHB1805, respectively by using gene-specific
primers consisting of 40–45 nt. The resulting PCR fragments
were transformed into yeast cells and colonies that appeared
on G418-, hygromycin B-containing YPAD plates or SC-Trp
plates were isolated. Gene disruption was confirmed by
genomic PCR. The Sequences of the primers used to generate
the DNA constructs used for gene disruption, or for checking
gene disruption, and details on the yeast strains used in study
will be provided upon request.
Sensitivity to DNA damaging agents
For the analysis of sensitivity to continuous exposure to DNA
damaging agents, 10-fold serial dilutions in distilled water of
logarithmically growing cells (constructed as described
above) were spotted onto YPAD plates, or YPAD plates con-
taining the indicated concentrations of MMS, or phleomycin.
The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30C and then pho-
tographed. For NHEJ analysis, strains containing galactose-
inducible HO endonuclease were grown overnight to 1 ·
107 cells/ml in YP medium containing 2% raffinose. After
washing once with water, aliquots of 10-fold serial dilutions
were plated on YP medium containing 2% raffinose, supple-
mented with either 2% galactose or 2% glucose. The plates
were incubated for 3 days at 30C and then photographed.
For the analysis of sensitivity to phleomycin, logarithmically
growing cells were diluted to 107 cells/ml and cultured in
the presence of 15 mg/ml nocodazole for 3 h to induce
G2/M phase arrest. G2/M-arrested cells were exposed to
100 mg/ml phleomycin for 1 and 2 h. The cells were washed
to remove phleomycin and nocodazole, diluted, and inocu-
lated onto YPAD plates. After 3 days incubation at 30C,
colonies were counted.
Analysis of the incidence of interchromosomal HR
between heteroalleles
Diploid strains with the MR101 background were constructed
such that recombination between the heteroalleles his1-1 and
his1-7 could be detected by the restoration of histidine proto-
trophy. As described previously (26), logarithmically grow-
ing cells were inoculated onto SC-His plates and YPAD
plates containing various concentrations of MMS to evaluate
the incidence of interchromosomal HR and colony forming
cells (CFCs), respectively.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
Logarithmically growing cells were diluted to 8 · 106 cells/
ml and cultured in the presence of 15 mg/ml nocodazole for
3 h at 30C to induce G2/M phase arrest. G2/M-arrested
cells were exposed to 100 mg/ml phleomycin for 2 h at
30C, washed to remove the phleomycin, and then cultured
at 30C in YPAD medium containing of 15 mg/ml nocodazole
for the indicated periods of time. Agarose plugs containing
chromosomal DNA were prepared as described previously,
with minor modifications (27). All plugs were subsequently
treated with Zymolyase 100T (0.15 mg/ml) and Proteinase
K (1 mg/ml) at 30C for 24 h. After electrophoresis, gels
were stained with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min,
destained in deionized water for 20 min, and then
photographed.
Cell fractionation
Whole cell extracts (WCEs) and chromatin pellets were pre-
pared as described previously (28), with the exception that
spheroplasts were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100
(EBX). WCEs were mixed with an equal volume of EBX buf-
fer and incubated for 10 min. WCEs were then centrifuged
through a sucrose cushion, and the resulting pellet was exam-
ined by immunoblot analysis for the presence of Elg1-13Myc.
Histone H3 was used as a loading control for protein levels in
WCEs and chromatin pellet (ChP) fractions.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP was carried out as described previously, with minor
modifications (29–32). Briefly, asynchronous cultures were
grown overnight at 30C in YP medium containing 2% raffi-
nose. Nocodazole (15 mg/ml) was added to the cultures when
they reached 6 · 106 cells/ml, and they were incubated at
30C for 5 h to induce G2/M phase arrest. Expression of
HO endonuclease was then induced by adding 2% galactose.
The cultures were washed 1 h after the addition of galactose,
and then treated with 2% glucose to repress the expression of
HO endonuclease. Cells were harvested, and incubated in 1%
formaldehyde for 15 min to cross-link proteins to DNA, then
the reaction was quenched by incubating cells in 125 mM
glycine for 5 min. Cells were lysed with glass beads, and
extracts were sonicated to shear DNA to an average size of
1 kb. Extracts were then divided into two aliquots: Input
DNA and IP DNA (1:20, respectively). Immunoprecipitation
was carried out using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody
(9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), a monoclonal
anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (Roche), or a polyclonal anti-
PCNA antibody (kind gift from Dr Sugino), and immune
complexes were captured using Dynabeads Protein G
(Dynal Biotech) for 4 h at 4C. After a series of washes, pro-
teins were released from the beads by incubation for 6 h at
65C. The samples were treated with protenase K, and
DNA was purified for PCR analysis using phenol extraction,
followed by ethanol precipitation.
PCR amplification
The following primers were used to amplify immunoprecipi-
tated DNA: P1 (50-TCCCCATCGTCTTGCTCT-30) and P2
(50-GCATGGGCAGTTTACCTTTAC-30), which span the
MATZ locus; P1 and P3 (50-CCCAAGGCTTAGTATACAC-
ATCC-30), which span the HMLa locus; or HO1-FW1 (50-
CCAGATTTGTATTAGACGAGGGACGGAGTGA-30) and
HO1-RV1 (50-AGAGGGTCACAGCACTAATACAGCTCG-
TAAT-30), which span the 2 kb region upstream of the HO
endonuclease-induced DSB site. Primers SMC2-FW1 (50-
GACGACCTTGTAACAGTCCAGACAG-30), and primer
SMC2-RV1 (50-GGCGAATTCCATCACATTATACTAAC-
TACGG-30), which anneal to the SMC2 locus, were used as
the controls. Amplified PCR products were separated by
agarose gel electrophoresis, and quantitated using NIH
image software. To correct for different levels of IP effici-
ency at different loci, the signal from the target locus was
first normalized to the signal from an independent locus
(SMC2) on chromosome VI, by dividing each target signal
by the corresponding SMC2 IP signal. For analysis of differ-
ent time points, MAT or HML IP signals were normalized to
the IP signal at 0 h, which was designated as 1. The data
represents the average of three independent experiments.
Error bars indicate the standard deviation.
In vivo physical monitoring of DSB induction,
strand invasion and repair completion during
recombination repair
DSB induction and strand invasion of input DNA were
detected by PCR. The primers used for detection of DSB
for MATa strains (JKM161) or MATa (JKM179) strains
were 50-CTTTTAGTTTCAGCTTTCCG-30 (pI)/50-ACTCTA-
TAAGGCCAAATGTACAAAC-30 (pJ), and 50-CTGGAAG-
TCAAAATACTCAGTTTCGACAG-30 (pG)/50-GGTGCAT-
TTGTCATCCGTCCCGTATAGC-30 (pH), respectively.
The primers used to monitor primer extension and ligation
were 50-CTGGAAGTCAAAATACTCAGTTTCGACAG-30
(pG)/50-GGTGCATTTGTCATCCGTCCCGTATAGC-30 (pH)
and 50-AGATGAGTTTAAATCCAGCATACTAG-30 (pC)/
50-TGTTGTCTCACTATCTTGCCAATAAG-30 (pD), respec-
tively. The primer extension and ligation assays were carried
out according to a previously described PCR-based method
(33). Amplified PCR products were separated by agarose gel
electrophoresis, and quantitated using NIH image software.
The signal from the target locus was normalized to the
amplified signal from an independent locus (SMC2) on chro-
mosome VI. Primer extension and ligation were arbitrarily
set at 100% for the highest wild-type level. The data repre-
sents the average of three independent experiments; error
bars represent the SD.
RESULTS
Elg1 responds to phleomycin-induced DNA damage
Previously it was shown that elg1 single deletion mutants are
sensitive to MMS, but not to hydroxyl urea (HU) or ultravio-
let (UV) light, and that Rad53 activation in response to MMS
was similar in wild-type cells and elg1 single mutants (3,4).
These results suggested that Elg1 might also function in DNA
repair. We extended this analysis by examining the sensitivity
of the elg1 single mutant to phleomycin as well as to MMS
and HU. Phleomycin, like bleomycin, creates DNA DSBs,
but in budding yeast, causes more significant DNA lesions
than bleomycin (34,35). In addition to previously reported
data that elg1 mutants were sensitive to MMS (Figure 1A)
(3), we further found that elg1 mutants were also sensitive
to phleomycin (Figure 1A). To further examine whether
Elg1 binds to sites of DNA damage under conditions that
preclude any potential interference of the DNA replication-
related functions of Elg1, we analyzed the association of
Elg1 with chromatin in G2/M phase-arrested cells after the
induction of DNA damage by MMS and pleomycin. As
shown in Figure 1B, the amount of Elg1 in chromatin-
containing fractions notably increased following exposure
of cells to MMS or phleomycin, indicating that Elg1 func-
tions in response to damaged DNA by binding to sites of
DNA damage.
Elg1 is required for phleomycin-induced DSB repair in
G2/M phase-arrested cells
We investigate whether Elg1 is involved in DSB repair,
because we notably found that elg1 mutants are sensitive to
phleomycin, which creates DSBs (34,35). On the other
hands, deletion of ELG1 causes defects in DNA replication
(3,4), and the replication defects in elg1 mutants could
potentially cause sequestration of recombination machinery
components (36). To avoid the potential influence of DNA
replication-specific defects in elg1 mutants, we examined
the function of Elg1 in the repair of DSBs induced by phleo-
mycin in G2/M phase-arrested cells. As seen in Figure 2A,

elg1 cells arrested in G2/M phase showed a higher sensitivity
to phleomycin than wild-type cells; however this result does
not necessarily exclude the possibility that elg1 cells are sen-
sitive to phleomycin in other phases of the cell cycle. To
monitor the formation and subsequent repair of DSBs, cells
arrested in G2/M were treated with phleomycin, and then cul-
tured in phleomycin-free medium containing nocodazole to
maintain G2/M arrest (Figure 2B). Chromosomal DNA was
isolated and subjected to PFGE. Distinct chromosomal
bands were absent following exposure to phleomycin in
both wild-type and elg1 cells, and concurrently, a low-
molecular-weight DNA smear appeared, reflecting the accu-
mulation of DNA DSBs (Figure 2C). Restoration of
chromosome-sized DNA bands was observed in both wild-
type and elg1 mutants after culture in phleomycin-free med-
ium. However, the reappearance of distinct chromosomal
bands was less efficient in elg1 mutants compared to wild-
type cells. These results suggested that Elg1 is involved in
DSB repair.
Elg1 is required for HR repair
DSBs can be repaired by the NHEJ pathway, which requires
Yku70, or the HR pathway, which requires Rad52 (37–39).
We next examined whether Elg1 was required for NHEJ-
mediated or HR-mediated repair. To examine the involve-
ment of Elg1 in NHEJ, single chromosomal DSB was
induced in the MAT locus by expressing HO endonuclease
in a galactose-dependent manner, in an elg1 mutant strain
in which use of the HR-mediated repair pathway was pre-
cluded, due to deletion of the homologous donor loci, HML
and HMR (Figure 3A). Sustained expression of HO endo-
nuclease leads to a continuous cycle of DNA cleavage and
ligation. If cells are competent for error-prone repair by
NHEJ, they will be able to grow in the presence of HO
endonuclease, while cells deficient in NHEJ will not survive
(40,41). When we examined the viability of elg1 and rad52
mutants under sustained expression of HO endonuclease,
we failed to detect a decrease in survival compared to
wild-type cells. In contrast, the viability of yku70 mutants
was decreased (Figure 3B). These results indicated that
Elg1 is not important for DSB repair by NHEJ.
To examine the involvement of Elg1 in HR, we investi-
gated for an interchromosomal recombination event between
heteroalleles his1-1/his1-7, using diploid elg1 single mutant
cells (Figure 3C). We observed an increase in spontaneous
recombination in elg1 mutants compared to wild-type cells
(Figure 3D), as reported previously (2). The incidence of
heteroallelic recombination in wild-type cells increased
with increasing concentrations of MMS (Figure 3E). In com-
parison, the recombination frequency in elg1 mutants was
lower than that of wild-type cells. Moreover, the recombi-
nation frequency following exposure to phleomycin was
also lower in elg1 mutants compared to wild-type cells

extract (WCE) and chromatin pellets (ChP) were prepared, and analyzed by
immunoblot for the presence of the indicated proteins. Histone H3 was used
as a loading control for protein levels in WCE and ChP fractions. Elg1-13myc
and Histone H3 were detected using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, and
anti-Histone H3-specific antibody, respectively.

Elg1 association around DSB sites did not depend
on Rad52
To characterize the sites of association of Elg1 in detail, we
examined Elg1 recruitment to a single chromosomal DSB site
in G2/M phase-arrested cells. Initially, we examined the
kinetics of Elg1 recruitment to DNA sequences on both
sides of the DSB site using yeast strain JKM179, which
lacks both the HML and HMR homologous donor sequences,
in order to more easily capture the initial binding of proteins
to the DSB site (Figure 4A). A DSB in the MAT locus was
induced by expression of HO endonuclease in JKM179
yeast expressing Myc-tagged Elg1 (Elg1-13Myc), and at vari-
ous time points after induction (0, 1, 2 and 4 h), cell aliquots
were removed and treated with formaldehyde to induce
crosslinking of proteins to DNA, then subjected to ChIP anal-
ysis. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR for the
presence of MAT-specific sequences from both sides of the
DSB (CEN-proximal site, HO1; CEN-distal site, MATZ)
(Figure 4A). PCR primers corresponding to sequences in
the SMC2 locus (an independent locus on chromosome VI)
were used as a control. Since the immunoprecipitation effici-
ency at each amplicon was different, amplified products were
normalized to the zero time point value (Normalized IP). As
seen in Figure 4B, following induction of HO endonuclease
expression, the DSB at the MAT locus was induced rapidly
and efficiently. Remarkably, binding of Elg1 to DNA
sequences on both sides of the DSB break site increased
2-fold after induction of HO endonuclease expression and
DSBs (Figure 4C and D). We also examined whether the

A galactose-inducible HO endonuclease was integrated at the ADE3 locus of
a haploid yeast strain that was defective in HR-mediated DSB repair. Upon
switching the cells to galactose, HO endonuclease is expressed, inducing a
single DSB at the MAT locus. Functional DSB repair can occur only through
the NHEJ pathway in this strain, since the HM donor loci, HML and HMR, are
deleted. (C) Schematic representation of the process and outcome of

containing the indicated concentrations of MMS or phleomycin, then
incubated at 30C for 3 days. The frequency of HR is presented as the

at least four cultures were taken for each point. The data represents the means

expressing Elg1-13myc were arrested in G2/M phase in 2% raffinose at 30
C,
then shifted to 2% galactose to induce expression of HO endonuclease and
DSBs. Genomic DNA was harvested at the indicated time points after the
shift. PCR was carried using ‘input DNA’ (see Materials and Methods), and
DSB primers, which flank the HO cleavage site. Amplification of the SMC2
locus on chromosome VI was used as a control. Cleavage efficiency (%
DSBs) at each time point was calculated as the ratio of MATa: SMC2 signal,
normalized to that of un-induced cells (zero time point). (C and D) Cells were
treated as described in B, and genomic DNA from cells at the indicated time

binding of Elg1 around the DSB site was dependent on
Rad52, which plays a major role during HR. The induction
of DSB occurred in a similar manner in rad52 mutants and
wild-type cells (Figure 4C and D). Importantly, we found
that the association of Elg1 with the MATZ and HO1 sites
was not dependent on Rad52 (Figure 4C and D).
Elg1 is recruited to homologous donor sites depending
on Rad52
HR-mediated chromosomal DSB repair is a multiple-step
process that includes recruitment of DNA repair enzymes to
the DSB site, strand invasion by a homologous template,
DNA synthesis, resolution of Holliday junctions and ligation.
One of the best characterized systems for studying HR is
HO endonuclease-induced MAT switching, using HML as
the donor template (42). In this system, repair of the HO
endonuclease-induced DSB in the MATa locus is accomp-
lished through recombination with the homologous HMLa
locus. We investigated DSB repair by HR in wild-type and
rad52 mutants, using strain JKM161, which contains
HMLa MATa as the donor template. By using a galactose-
inducible GAL::HO gene, we were able to induce a DSB
synchronously in all cells of the population. DSB formation
at the HO recognition site and invasion of the MAT recipient
strand into the donor strand (HML) were monitored by PCR
using the primers shown in Figure 5A. The amount of PCR
product corresponding to the MATa locus was considerably
decreased 1 h after induction of HO endonuclease in wild-
type cells and rad52 mutants; that is, cleavage at the MAT
locus occurred within 1 h with high-efficiency. Strand inva-
sion was detected 2 and 4 h after induction of HO in wild-
type cells but not in rad52 mutants, as expected (Figure 5B).
To examine whether Elg1 was recruited to both the MAT
recipient locus and the HML donor locus during the process
of recombination, we performed ChIP analysis using the
primers shown in Figure 5C. Under the conditions in
Figure 4B, the association of Elg1 with the DSB site in the
MAT locus was observed 1 h after induction of HO endonu-
clease in wild-type cells and rad52 mutants (Figure 5D).
Importantly, the association of Elg1 with the HML donor
strand was also observed and increased during incubation
(Figure 5E). However, the association of Elg1 with the
HML donor strand was not observed in rad52 mutants
(Figure 5E), suggesting that Elg1 is recruited to DNA region
required for HR repair.
Late stages of HR repair are inefficiently completed in
elg1 mutants
We next examined whether Elg1 was necessary for extension
of the invading MAT DNA strand of the homologous HMLa
donor site, a step which requires DNA polymerization. DSB
formation at the HO recognition site, primer extension fol-
lowing strand invasion on the donor strand and completion
of repair (ligation) were monitored by PCR, using the primers
shown in Figure 6A. Formation of a DSB occurred with
the same kinetics in elg1 mutants and wild-type cells
(Figure 6B). In contrast, extension of the invading DNA
strand was slightly reduced in elg1 mutants, compared to
wild-type cells (Figure 6C; left panel). Following strand
invasion and resolution of Holliday junctions, the process

of recombination repair is completed by DNA ligation. We
monitored the completion of repair following extension of
the invading DNA strand in elg1 mutants. In elg1 mutants,
the completion of the late stage, post-synaptic DNA repair
step was slightly delayed and reduced compared to wild-
type cells (Figure 6C; right panel).
Effect of Elg1 on the recruitment of PCNA to the MAT
recipient locus and the homologous HMLa donor site
Elg1 and PCNA physically interact with each other (4).
Moreover, over-expression of PCNA rescued the MMS sensi-
tivity of elg1 mutants (3).Mutation of PCNA (POL30) results
in a defect in primer extension during HO-induced HR (43),
suggesting that Elg1 is required for loading of PCNA during
recombination repair. We observed that the amount of PCNA,
as well as Elg1, in chromatin-containing fractions notably
increased following exposure to MMS or phleomycin (data
not shown). To examine whether PCNA was recruited to
the MAT recipient and the HML donor loci during the process
of recombination, we performed ChIP analysis using the pri-
mers shown in Figure 6D. The association of PCNA with the
MAT recipient and the HML donor loci was observed in both
elg1 mutants and wild-type cells (Figure 6E). Unexpectedly,
the level of association of PCNA with these loci was almost
the same in elg1 mutants and wild-type cells.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we examined the role of Elg1 in the
DNA damage response in S.cerevisiae. Previous reports
have suggested that Elg1 might function as a checkpoint
sensor, similar to the RFC-like checkpoint protein Rad24,
because elg1 rad24 ctf18 triple mutants, which do not contain
alternative RFC-like proteins, are completely defective in
intra-S checkpoint control (3,4). Although the elg1 single
mutant is sensitive to DNA damaging agents, it is reportedly
not defective in the activation of the DNA damage
checkpoint (3).
The main finding of this study is that the Rfc1-like protein
Elg1 participates in DNA damage-induced recombination
repair itself. It was previously shown that deletion of ELG1
increases the incidence of spontaneous recombination in
yeast (2). Previous studies have shown that an elevated
frequency of mitotic recombination is a signal of DNA repli-
cation defects (44,45), and it has been proposed that Elg1 is
involved in efficient lagging strand DNA synthesis (3,4).
Accordingly, one of the potential explanations for the
observed spontaneous hyper-recombination of elg1 mutants
is that these cells are defective in DNA replication. In con-
trast to spontaneous recombination, we found that the
frequency of MMS- or phleomycin-induced recombination
was decreased in elg1 mutants compared to wild-type cells
(Figure 3).
To avoid potential complications due to defects in DNA
replication in elg1 mutants, we examined the function of
Elg1 in G2/M phase-arrested cells. We showed that the repair
efficiency of phleomycin-induced DSB in elg1 mutants was
lower than wild-type cells in G2/M phase (Figure 2). In the
HO endonuclease-induced recombination system, Elg1 asso-
ciated with both sides of the HO-induced DSB site (Figure 4),
suggesting that Elg1 plays a role in early events in HR or the
damage response. In response to DSBs, the MRX complex, a
heterotrimeric protein assembly of Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2,
arrives first at DSB sites and performs nucleolytic resection
to generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This is essential
for subsequent protein assembly (46). ssDNA is recognized
by the ssDNA binding protein RPA, and the DNA damage
checkpoint factors, Rad24-RFC and Ddc1/Mec3/Rad17, are
recruited in RPA-dependent manner. Lastly, the proteins
that are directly involved in HR are recruited to the DSB
site. The assembly of HR proteins on ssDNA is initiated by
Rad52, which in turn causes strand invasion. We found that
the association of Elg1 with DSB sites was not dependent
on Rad52 (Figure 4). Importantly, we found that Elg1 is
also recruited to the HML donor locus, and that this was
dependent on the function of Rad52 (Figure 5E), suggesting
that Elg1 functions in HR after strand invasion has occurred.
Alternatively, it may not be the donor locus per se that is
associated with Elg1. In other words, the donor locus may
only engage in preferential interaction with Elg1 when it
has already formed a Holliday junction with the invading
end. Thus, the interaction between Elg1 and the donor
locus is probably a consequence of the complex that origi-
nally formed at the double-stranded break.
The MAT switching system provides a good model for
DSB repair based on synthesis dependent strand annealing
(SDSA) (36,47). In this system, DNA synthesis is initiated
from the end of the invading strand, as in leading-strand syn-
thesis. The newly synthesized DNA is displaced from the
template (MATYa region), returned to the original strand,
and ligated (Figure 6A). After the removal of the non-
homologous region (MATYa) at the DSB site by probably
Rad1-Rad10 and Msh2-Msh3 (48,49), DNA synthesis is ini-
tiated from the second end of the DSB using the returning
strand as the template, as in leading-strand synthesis, fol-
lowed by ligation to form an intact double-strand. Of note,
mutation of either RFC (CDC44) or PCNA (POL30) results
in a defect in primer extension during HO-induced HR
(43), suggesting that the RFC1 complex is required for load-
ing of PCNA during DNA repair as well. It has been shown
that Elg1 and PCNA physically interact with each other (4).
Moreover, over-expression of PCNA rescued the MMS sen-
sitivity of elg1 mutants (3). In the current study, we show
that elg1 mutants are partially defective in MMS-induced
recombination (Figure 3E), and Elg1 is also recruited to the
homologous donor locus depending on Rad52 (Figure 5E).
Recombination assay showed 2- to 4-fold reduction of
MMS- or phleomycin-induced recombination frequency in
elg1 mutants compared to wild-type cells (Figure 3E and
F). In addition, we carried out PCR-based analysis of the effi-
ciency of primer extension from the invaded strand, and liga-
tion of the synthesized strand after induction of HO-induced
DSB. The efficiency of primer extension and ligation of the
synthesized strand slightly decreases in elg1 mutants
(Figure 6C). It seems likely that the defect in elg1 mutants
lies at the primer extension step or a step earlier than primer
extension. Although it is unknown how Elg1 is recruited onto
the donor sites at the molecular level, the interaction of Elg1
with the donor sites seems to facilitate the above steps in HR
via PCNA-mediated DNA synthesis. Then we investigated
the association of PCNA with the HML locus as well as the

MATZ locus after induction of DSB by HO endonuclease, and
confirmed the association of PCNA with these loci. Unex-
pectedly, the amount of PCNA associated these loci did not
differ between elg1 mutants and wild-type cells
(Figure 6E), suggesting that Elg1 might be not involved in
the loading of PCNA during HR. The defect in HO-induced
HR repair in elg1 mutants was relatively mild compared to
that observed in phleomycin-induced HR. This may reflect
the fact that the total number of DSBs induced by phleomycin
is quite large, compared to the single DSB induced by HO
endonuclease expression. Thus, we could not exclude the
possibility that the sensitivity of ChIP assay was too low
to detect the small difference between elg1 mutants and
wild-type cells due to main requirement of canonical RFC
for the loading of PCNA.
If Elg1 is not involved in the loading of PCNA, what is the
function of Elg1 in HR? It has been reported that mutants of
DNA polymerase d (Pol3) and e (Pol2), pol3-14 and pol2-18,
show a mild defect in HR repair, while the PCNA mutants
(pol30-52) are completely defective in HR (36). Taken
together, it seems conceivable that Elg1 plays a role in
the efficient recruitment of either DNA polymerase d or e,
directly or indirectly, by interacting with PCNA, or in choos-
ing or switching to the optimum DNA polymerase for repair
synthesis.
It has been reported that sgs1 cells, which show sponta-
neous hyper-recombination, are defective in damage-induced
recombination (50,51). Thus, it is not surprising that elg1
cells show not only spontaneous hyper-recombination but
an apparent damage-induced hypo-recombination. Sponta-
neous hyper-recombination is one of the hallmarks of a defect
in DNA replication, because many temperature sensitive
mutants in DNA replication show hyper-recombination phe-
notypes. In agreement with the above notion, elg1 cells
show some defects in DNA replication (3,4). The classical
RFC complex (without Elg1) is probably adequate for the
mediation of the protein interactions required for the DNA
repair process during normal growth (low level of DNA
damage). However, upon induction of massive DNA damage,
the classical RFC complex probably cannot accommodate
any longer the full cellular demand for DNA repair. Thus,
Elg1 is more important under damage-induced conditions
than during normal cell growth. Even small defects in geno-
me maintenance mechanisms should not be dismissed, how-
ever, as they may exert a significant influence on the fitness
of an organism. Thus, ELG1 is an attractive candidate as a
novel anti-oncogene, as its deletion seems to result in signifi-
cant genome instability, which is associated with an increased
risk for cancer (52).
