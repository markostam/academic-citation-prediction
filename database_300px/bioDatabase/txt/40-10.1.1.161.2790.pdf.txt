[1] The equilibrium sensitivity of Earth’s climate is determined as the quotient of the
relaxation time constant of the system and the pertinent global heat capacity. The heat
capacity of the global ocean, obtained from regression of ocean heat content versus global
mean surface temperature, GMST, is 14 ± 6 W a m2 K1, equivalent to 110 m of
ocean water; other sinks raise the effective planetary heat capacity to 17 ± 7 W a m2 K1
(all uncertainties are 1-sigma estimates). The time constant pertinent to changes in
GMST is determined from autocorrelation of that quantity over 1880–2004 to be 5 ± 1 a.
The resultant equilibrium climate sensitivity, 0.30 ± 0.14 K/(W m2), corresponds to an
equilibrium temperature increase for doubled CO2 of 1.1 ± 0.5 K. The short time
constant implies that GMST is in near equilibrium with applied forcings and hence that net
climate forcing over the twentieth century can be obtained from the observed
temperature increase over this period, 0.57 ± 0.08 K, as 1.9 ± 0.9 W m2. For this forcing
considered the sum of radiative forcing by incremental greenhouse gases, 2.2 ± 0.3 W
m2, and other forcings, other forcing agents, mainly incremental tropospheric
aerosols, are inferred to have exerted only a slight forcing over the twentieth century of
0.3 ± 1.0 W m2.

1. Introduction
[2] Changes in Earth’s radiation budget due to human
influences are of major current concern [Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007]. Of principal
concern is the change in climate due to increased concen-
trations of carbon dioxide because of the long lifetime of
excess CO2 in the atmosphere-ocean system and the intrin-
sic connection of excess CO2 to energy production through
fossil fuel use. While there are many indicia of climate
change that may result from increased atmospheric concen-
trations of CO2, the principal index of change is the increase
in global mean temperature, especially as this change is the
driver of, or is closely correlated with, changes in other key
components of the climate system such as atmospheric
water vapor content, the nature and extent of clouds, land
and sea ice cover, and sea level.
[3] Although climate change has been the subject of
intense research for the past 3 decades, little progress has
been made in decreasing the uncertainty associated with
equilibrium sensitivity, the equilibrium change in global
mean surface temperature GMST that would result from a
sustained radiative forcing, typically expressed as that
which would result from a doubling of atmospheric CO2
(Figure 1). While the apparent slow rate of progress in
decreasing this uncertainty does not reflect the many
advances in understanding of the many processes that need
to be represented in global climate models, it nonetheless
suggests the utility if not the necessity of alternative
approaches to determining climate sensitivity on a timescale
such that this determination can be made in a way that it can
usefully inform policymaking. For a recent review of
approaches to determine climate sensitivity and examination
of constraints on the magnitude of this sensitivity see Annan
and Hargreaves [2006]. Here an initial attempt is made to
determine climate sensitivity through energy balance con-
siderations that are based on the time dependence of GMST
and ocean heat content over the period for which instru-
mental measurements are available.
[4] This paper consists of an exposition of the single-
compartment energy balance model that is used for the
present empirical analysis, empirical determination of the
effective planetary heat capacity that is coupled to climate
change on the decadal timescale from trends of GMST
and ocean heat content, empirical determination of the
climate system time constant from analysis of autocorre-
lation of the GMST time series, and the use of these
quantities to provide an empirical estimate of climate
sensitivity. These results are then used to draw inferences
about climate forcing over the twentieth century, for
which reliable estimates of change in global mean tem-
perature are available.

ative balance between absorbed shortwave (solar) radiation

[6] Within this single-compartment energy balance model
[e.g., North et al., 1981; Dickinson, 1982; Hansen et al.,
1985; Harvey, 2000; Andreae et al., 2005; Boer et al., 2007]
an energy imbalance Q  E arising from a secular pertur-
bation in Q or E results in a rate of change of the global heat
content given by
dH
dt
¼ Q E; ð2Þ
where dH/dt is the change in heat content of the climate
system. The Ansatz of the energy balance model is that dH/
dt may be related to the change in GMST as
dH

¼ C dTs
dt
; ð3Þ
where C is the pertinent heat capacity. Here it must be
stressed that C is an effective heat capacity that reflects only
that portion of the global heat capacity that is coupled to the
perturbation on the timescale of the perturbation. In the
present context of global climate change induced by
changes in atmospheric composition on the decade to
century timescale the pertinent heat capacity is that which is
subject to change in heat content on such timescales.
Measurements of ocean heat content over the past 50 a
indicate that this heat capacity is dominated by the heat
capacity of the upper layers of the world ocean [Levitus et
al., 2005]. (Here and throughout this paper the symbol ‘‘a,’’
for annum, is used to denote the unit year.) From (2) and (3)

Energy balance of the climate system in response to a
perturbation in radiation is restored as the climate system
relaxes to a new steady state. As Ts increases in response to
an imposed positive change in the radiation budget (positive
forcing), the outgoing longwave flux increases, limiting the
resulting increase in temperature rise. Conventionally for
small perturbations a linear relation is assumed between
steady state change in Ts, DTs(1), and an imposed forcing
F = D(Q  E):
DTs 1ð Þ ¼ l1s F; ð5Þ

[7] The time-dependent response of Earth’s average sur-
face temperature to an imposed radiative forcing is gener-
ally characterized in terms of the e-folding time t that
would characterize relaxation to a new steady state follow-
ing a perturbation. For a small step-function radiative
forcing F imposed at time t = 0, solution of equation (4)
[Dickinson, 1982; Hansen et al., 1985; Harvey, 2000] yields

Knowledge of Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity ls

and time constant t is essential to interpreting climate
change over the anthropocene era and to predicting future
climate change in response to assumed forcings. These
quantities are not well known. The present estimate of
Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity, expressed as the
increase in global mean surface temperature for doubled
CO2, is DT2  31+1.5 K [IPCC, 2007], corresponding, for
the forcing of doubled CO2, F2 = 3.7 W m

function forcing yields

For the present global mean surface temperature Ts 288 K,

mean surface temperature that would result from sustained
doubling of atmospheric CO2 (left axis) is converted to unit

taken as 3.7 W m2 [IPCC, 2007].

indicative of positive feedback. In the energy balance
framework a positive feedback would result from a decrease
in effective emissivity of the planet e with increasing GMST
because of increased water vapor mixing ratio in the
atmosphere, and/or an increase in planetary coalbedo g due
to decrease in cloudiness with increasing GMST. Such
feedbacks result in l1 and t being increased above their
values by a feedback factor f such that

The value of the feedback factor, and hence of the
equilibrium sensitivity and time constant of Earth’s climate
system, are not known. It is generally agreed that the
feedback factor is no greater than several fold [Hansen et
al., 1985], but the plausible range in f admits to substantial
uncertainty in ls

[9] The linear energy balance model readily admits solu-
tion to a forcing that is time-dependent. For a forcing that
increases linearly with time F = bt,
DTs tð Þ ¼ bl1s t  tð Þ þ tet=t

; ð11Þ
at time following the onset of the perturbation sufficiently
great that transients have died away, t ^ 3t,
DTs tð Þ  bl1s t  tð Þ: ð12Þ
If t is short compared to the duration of the forcing, then
GMST would be expected to closely follow the forcing,
with little lag; and if the change in forcing were abruptly
stopped the additional change in GMST would be
DTlag ¼ bl1s t: ð13Þ
Alternatively, if t is long, then the change in GMST would
considerably lag the forcing and temperature would
continue to change substantially before the climate system
reached a new steady state. In particular for a situation in
which climate is being forced by increasing concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases, the increase in temperature
beyond that realized at a given observation time that
might be expected in response to forcing that has been
applied until that time has been denoted ‘‘unrealized’’ or
‘‘committed’’ warming that is ‘‘in the pipeline’’ and is
attributed to ‘‘thermal inertia’’ [Meehl et al., 2005;
Wigley, 2005; Friedlingstein and Solomon, 2005; Hansen
et al., 2005]. Knowledge of which situation characterizes
Earth’s climate is key to interpreting climate change that
has occurred over the anthropocene. If the climate system
rapidly equilibrates, then climate sensitivity can be
inferred from the forcing and the increase in temperature
over a given time period. In contrast, if the climate
response time is long, inferring climate sensitivity in this
way would lead to an estimate of sensitivity that would
be too low, perhaps substantially so.
[10] Although the energy balance model provides a
framework for interpretation of the equilibrium sensitivity
of Earth’s climate system, the key quantities, ls
1, t, and C
are not known a priori but must be determined. Within this
model the three quantities are related by equation (7) so that
determination of any two of these quantities leads to
knowledge of the third. Here observations of global mean
surface temperature over 1880–2004 and ocean heat con-
tent over 1956–2003 permit empirical determination of the
climate system time constant t, and effective heat capacity
C. The equilibrium sensitivity ls
1 of Earth’s climate system
is determined as
l1s ¼ t=C: ð14Þ
3. Determination of the Effective Heat Capacity
of Earth’s Climate System
[11] A useful result from the energy balance model is a
relation between the rate of change of the total global heat
content H and the rate of change of global mean surface
temperature Ts, equation (3), which allows the effective heat
capacity of the system to be estimated empirically as
C ¼ dH=dt
dTs=dt
ð15Þ
provided rate of change of both H and Ts are known. For
this evaluation I make use of compilations of the heat
content of the world ocean, as tabulated for the years 1956–
2002 by Levitus et al. [2005] for ocean depth from the
surface to 300, 700, and 3000 m (denoted here L300, L700,
and L3000, respectively). As noted above, this ocean heat
content anomaly accounts for most but not all of increase in
the heat content of the planet over this time period; hence
the resulting estimate of planetary heat capacity must be
increased to take into account other heat reservoirs. For
GMST I use the values tabulated by the Goddard Institute of
Space Studies (GISS, NASA, USA [Hansen et al., 1996],
updated at http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) and the Cli-
matic Research Unit (CRU, University of East Anglia, UK
[Jones and Moberg, 2003], updated at http://cdiac.esd.ornl.
gov/trends/temp/jonescru/jones.html). Time series of these
quantities are shown in Figure 2. The rates of change of
temperature anomaly and heat content anomaly with time
were evaluated as the slopes of linear fits to each of the data
sets (Table 1). Uncertainties associated with the slopes were
evaluated taking into account temporal autocorrelation by
multiplying the conventional variance in slope by the factor
[1 + 2Sr(Dt)], where r(Dt) is the autocorrelation coefficient
of the time series as a function of lag time Dt and the sum is
taken up to the last nonnegative value of r [Leith, 1973].
The slopes of the ocean heat content data dH/dt based on
temperature sounding data represent an unambiguous
measure of ocean heating rate to the indicated depths.
Despite the order-of-magnitude greater heat capacity, the
heating rate from 300 m to 3000 m was only about 50%
greater than that from the surface to 300 m, indicative that
D24S05 SCHWARTZ: SENSITIVITY OF EARTH’S CLIMATE SYSTEM

D24S05
the relevant heat capacity of the climate system is within
about a factor of 2.5 of that of the first 300 m and is thus
likely to represent the great majority of the ocean that is
coupled to the climate system on the multidecadal timescale
examined here; for uniform penetration the heat capacity
would scale roughly as the depth.
[12] Also shown in Table 1 are values of the effective
global ocean heat capacity determined by equation (15) as
the ratio of the rates of increase of GMST and oceanic heat
content. For each ocean depth, surface to 300, 700, and
3000 m the resulting values of effective heat capacity given
for the two temperature data sets are fairly similar, reflective
of the fairly close agreement of the two temperature trend
compilations. The effective heat capacity increases with
ocean depth indicative of the incremental amount of ocean
water that is being heated. However, this increase in heat
capacity with depth is well less than the increase in depth
itself, indicative that less of the deeper water is coupled to
the surface, as expected. The relation between C, dH/dt, and
dTs/dt is depicted graphically in Figure 3, in which the
diagonals represent constant values of C; for the slightly
greater value of dTs/dt for the GISS data set than for the
CRU data set the effective ocean heat capacity is slightly
lower.
[13] A potential concern with evaluating global ocean
heat capacity as (dH/dt)/(dTs/dt) that is manifested in
Figure 2 arises from the relatively large fluctuation in ocean
heat content compared to that in the temperature anomaly
data series. The upward fluctuations in ocean heat content
represent an increase in planetary heat content that is greater
than the average over the time period, and correspondingly
the downward fluctuations represent a loss in planetary heat
content. What can give rise to such fluctuations that are
evidently unforced by the surface temperature? Clearly the
planetary heat balance must be fluctuating on account of
changes in planetary coalbedo and/or effective planetary
emissivity on these timescales, as these are the only means
by which the heat content of the planet can change. As these
changes are not forced by the surface temperature they must
therefore be manifestations of internal variability of the
climate system. For this reason it seems essential, for the
purpose of inferring planetary heat capacity, that as long a
time base as possible be used in evaluating the two slopes.
[14] An alternative approach to evaluation of C (method 2)
is as the slope of a graph of global heat content versus
GMST
C ¼ dH=dTs; ð16Þ
as shown in Figure 4. Here the slopes are evaluated
according to the ‘‘ordinary least squares bisector method,’’

temperature anomaly (right axis). Global ocean heat content data L300, L700, and L3000, are from
Levitus et al. [2005] for ocean depths from the surface to 300, 700, and 3000 m, respectively. For L300
and L700 the data represent annual averages (1956–2002); for L3000, for which the measurements are
more sparse, the data represent 5-a running averages (1958–1995) plotted at the center of the averaging
period. CRU denotes global average surface temperature from the Climate Research Unit, University of
East Anglia, U. K. [Jones and Moberg, 2003]; GISS denotes global average surface temperature from the

regressions to the several data sets.

1973].

which treats both variables (H and Ts) symmetrically in the
least squares analysis [Isobe et al., 1990] and which was
shown by those investigators to be likely to yield an
unbiased estimate of the regression slope, as is desired here,
rather than a biased estimate that would result from least
squares regression on only one of the variables; auto-
correlation was accounted for in the estimated uncertainties
as above. The results of this analysis, summarized in
Table 2, are quite similar to those obtained as the ratio of the
slopes of H and T versus time, Table 1. However, the value
of C determined for ocean heat content from the surface to
3000 m is about 25% less than that obtained by equation
(15) as the ratio of the slopes of the two quantities versus
time.
[15] The overall average heat capacities given in Table 2
are the averages of the values obtained by the two methods;
the uncertainties encompass the bulk of the values
obtained by both methods. It must be stressed that the
effective heat capacity of the global ocean determined in
this way is not an intrinsic property of the climate system
but is reflective of the rate of penetration of heat energy
into the ocean in response to the particular pattern of
forcing that Earth has experienced prior to and during the
period of the measurements.
[16] Also given in Table 2 for the several depths are the
values of ocean depth that would exhibit the same heat
capacity as is effectively coupled to the climate system. This
coupled heat capacity is much less than the actual heat
capacity of the ocean to the indicated depths, 23%, 16%,
and 5%, for depths 300 m, 700 m, and 3000 m, respectively.
It must be stressed that the heat penetration is not uniform
globally, but is manifested in plumes in the regions of deep
water formation. This is illustrated by the contours of
heating in Figure 2 of Levitus et al. [2005], which also
shows the much lower heating rates at depth compared to
those near the surface. The relatively small increase in
ocean heat content between 700 and 3000 m depth suggests
that the great majority of ocean heat content is encompassed

versus rate of increase of global mean surface temperature
dTs/dt for 1960–2000; lines of constant heat capacity permit
assessment of global heat capacity as ratio (dH/dt)/(dTs/dt).
Values of dH/dt are evaluated from data of Levitus et al.
[2005] for ocean depths from the surface to 300, 700, and
3000 m, as in Figure 2. Values of dTs/dt are given as
determined from the GISS and CRU compilations of
temperature data as in Figure 2. Uncertainties are one-
sigma estimates taking into account autocorrelation [Leith,
1973].

Temperature anomaly data are from the (left) GISS and
(right) CRU compilations. All data were adjusted to exhibit
mean values of 0 to facilitate evaluation of the slopes, which
were obtained as the bisector of the slope of the ordinary
least squares regression of H against T and the inverse of the
slope of the regression of T against H [Isobe et al., 1990].
Slopes (red) (top left in each panel and Table 2) yield the
global mean heat capacity in units of W a m2 K1;
uncertainty ranges (green) are calculated from estimated
standard error of slope, evaluated as the square root of the
estimated variance in the slope divided by the square root of
the effective number of independent measurements taking
into account autocorrelation [Leith, 1973]. Color bar

in depths less than 3000 m; the average depth of the world
ocean is about 3800 m.
[17] The present analysis indicates that the effective heat
capacity of the world ocean pertinent to climate change on
this multidecadal scale may be taken as 14 ± 6Wa m2 K1.
The effective heat capacity determined in this way is
equivalent to the heat capacity of 106 m of ocean water
or, for ocean fractional area 0.71, the top 150 m of the world
ocean. This effective heat capacity is thus comparable to the
heat capacity of the ocean mixed layer.
[18] Estimates of the effective ocean heat capacity have
previously been presented by Andreae et al. [2005] and by
Frame et al. [2005], in neither instance with description of
how the quantity was calculated or any statistical analysis.
Evidently in both instances the effective heat capacity was
inferred from the observed change in global mean ocean
heat content to the 3000 m depth over the total time period
1958–1995 of the Levitus et al. [2005] data, divided by the
change in global mean surface temperature over the same
period. The estimate presented by Andreae et al. [2005],
1.1 ± 0.5 GJ m2 K1 equivalent to 35 ± 16 W a m2 K1,
is much greater than and wholly inconsistent with the value
obtained here. The value presented by Frame et al. [2005],
(0.1–2.05) GJ m2 K1 (5–95% confidence) equivalent to
(3.2–65) W a m2 K1, encompasses the value obtained
here but extends both to much higher and much lower
values. A possible explanation for the discrepancies is that
an approach that is based on the difference over the full time
period gives undue weight to the end-members of the time
series rather than relying on the totality of the data.
[19] Following the estimate of Levitus et al. [2005] that
the heat uptake of the world ocean constitutes 84% of the
total heat uptake by the climate system (other major
components are heating of continental landmasses, 5%;
melting of continental glaciers, 5%; and heating of the
atmosphere, 4%), I evaluate the global heat capacity perti-
nent to climate change on the multidecadal scale as 16.7 ±
7.0 W a m2 K1.
[20] In a simulation with two coupled ocean-atmosphere
climate models of the response of Earth’s climate system to
the shortwave aerosol cooling forcing following the 1991
eruption of Mount Pinatubo Boer et al. [2007] inferred
effective heat capacity of the climate system to be 0.25GJm2
(8 W a m2 K1), which they noted to be comparable to the
heat capacity of a mixed layer ocean of depth 50 m. A
concern raised by those investigators over the pertinence of
a heat capacity determined in this way to the multidecadal
timescales associated with greenhouse forcing is the short
timescale of the volcanic aerosol forcing, which they
characterized by a time constant of 8 months, resulting in
relatively little penetration of the thermal signal into the
deep ocean.
[21] The heat capacity determined from this analysis leads
to a value of the time constant of the global climate system
in the absence of feedbacks (equation (8)) t0 = 5 ± 2 a.
4. Time Constant of Earth’s Climate System
From Time Series Analysis
[22] The second quantity necessary for empirical deter-
mination of Earth’s climate sensitivity is the time constant
describing relaxation of global mean surface temperature
following a perturbation. Again the intent is to determine
this quantity empirically. Here I use the framework of time
series analysis to infer this time constant from the temporal
autocorrelation of GMST. This analysis rests fundamentally
on the fluctuation dissipation theorem of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics [Einstein, 1905], which relates the impulse
response of a dynamic system to the fluctuations of the
system. While this applicability remains an open question,
several studies, notably Leith [1975, 1978] have made the
case for its applicability to Earth’s climate system. The
analytical framework of the fluctuation dissipation theorem
has been applied to analysis of the behavior of climate
models by Bell [1980], North et al. [1993], and more
recently Cionni et al. [2004] and von Storch [2004].
[23] Under the assumption that the system behaves as a
first-order Markov or autoregressive process [Leith, 1973;
Allen and Smith, 1996; von Storch and Zwiers, 1999], for
which a quantity is assumed to decay to its mean value with
time constant t but is subject also to random perturbations,
the autocorrelation coefficient of the data, that is, the
Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of the time
series with a copy of itself lagged by time Dt, is related to
the time constant characterizing the relaxation of departures

The autocorrelation properties of times series of meteor-
ological data have been examined by several investigators
in the context of inferring the time period characterizing loss
of memory of prior states, for the purpose of adducing
criteria of forecast skill or determining the number of
degrees of freedom pertinent to calculation of the variance
of a data set under examination [Leith, 1973; Trenberth,
1985; von Storch and Zwiers, 1999; Cohn and Lins, 2005].
Autocorrelation results in the effective number of indepen-
dent samples being less, often substantially so, than the
number of measurements. With respect to GMST anomaly,
attention has likewise previously been focused mainly on
detection of trends and searches for periodic oscillations
[e.g., Ghil and Vautard, 1991; Allen and Smith, 1996; Tol
and Vellinga, 1998; Rybski et al., 2006], with little attention
having been paid to the information content of the
autocorrelation pertinent to the relaxation time constant
and sensitivity of the climate system. The autocorrelation of
Ts and the cross correlation between NH and SH hemi-
spheric annual mean temperature was examined by Wigley
et al. [1998] in the context of comparisons of the observed
time series and those obtained with general circulation
models, but the implications of this autocorrelation on the
time constant of the climate system were not pursued.
[24] Here the time constant representative of the relaxa-
tion of GMST to perturbations is obtained from analysis of
the autocorrelation of annual GMST anomaly Ts(i), using
the GISS and CRU annual global mean temperature anom-
aly data sets for the time period 1880–2004. The steps of
the procedure are illustrated in Figure 5. First the time series
was detrended by subtracting a linear fit and normalized.
Detrending is necessary for nonstationary data set for which
the long-term trend induces an artificially long autocorrela-
tion that is not reflective of the inherent fluctuations [von
Storch and Zwiers, 1999]; the consequences and implica-
tions of this detrending are examined below. For the
detrended time series an autocorrelogram consisting of
lagged autocorrelation coefficients r(Dt) for all Dt was
calculated. Satisfaction of the assumption of a first-order
Markov process was assessed by examination of the resid-
uals of the lag-1 regression, which were found to exhibit no
further significant autocorrelation. Values of the relaxation
time constant t(Dt) were then calculated according to (18)
for all Dt until the first nonpositive value of r was
encountered. As seen in Figure 5g, values of t were found
to increase with increasing lag time from about 2 a at lag
time Dt = 1 a, reaching an asymptotic value of about 5 a by
about lag time Dt = 8 a. As similar results were obtained
with various subsets of the data (first and second halves of
the time series; data for Northern and Southern Hemi-
spheres, Figure 6) and for the deseasonalized monthly data
(Figure 7), this estimate of the time constant would appear
to be robust. The increase in t with increasing Dt would
seem to be indicative of increased coupling to elements of
the climate system having greater time constant; the leveling
off of t to a constant value of about 5 a at lag times as great
as 15–18 a suggests that the time constant obtained in this
way is reflective of the time constant of the climate system

on a multidecadal scale pertinent to changes over the
industrial period. From the estimated uncertainties in t at
a given value of Dt, which are obtained from the estimated
variance of individual values of r calculated using an
expression presented by Bartlett [1946], I estimate the
asymptotic value of t as 5 ± 1 a.
[25] A time constant for planetary response to climate
change of just a few years would seem to run counter to the
notion that climate change is a slow process, playing out
over centuries if not millennia. Such a long climate system
response time is noted in several studies with coupled
ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs).
Wetherald et al. [2001] found the increase of global mean
surface temperature with a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean
general circulation model to lag that in a model with a
mixed layer ocean by 20–30 a, which they took as a
measure of the time constant of climate system response.
Meehl et al. [2005] reported experiments with two different
coupled ocean-atmosphere models in which forcing was
held constant at the year-2000 level. In both experiments Ts
asymptoted to a final value about 0.2 K greater than the year-
2000 value, with an e-folding time of about 30 a. Hansen et
al. [2005] argue, on the basis of the temperature sensitivity of
their model and the unrealized forcing due to uptake of heat
into the oceans, which they took as 0.60 Wm2 over the past
decade, that for forcing held constant at present levels, Ts
would increase another 0.6 K as the climate approached a
new steady state. Using a simple model that is calibrated
against a range of coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs Wigley
[2005] finds substantial increase in global mean surface
temperature in response to a present atmospheric composi-
tion held constant continuing on timescales of 50 to 400 a.
[26] In contrast to these studies there is a growing body of
observational evidence to suggest that the time over which
changes in climate can take place can be quite short, just a
few years. High-resolution studies of temperature change in
ice cores as inferred from isotope ratios and other variables
demonstrate substantial widespread temperature change in
periods as short as 5 to 10 a [Taylor et al., 1997; National
Research Council, 2002; Alley et al., 2003]. The view of a

short time constant for climate change gains support also
from records of widespread change in surface temperature
following major volcanic eruptions. Such eruptions abruptly
enhance planetary reflectance as a consequence of injection
of light-scattering aerosol particles into the stratosphere. A
cooling of global proportions in 1816 and 1817 followed
the April 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia.
Snow fell in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and portions
of Massachusetts and New York in June 1816, and hard
frosts were reported in July and August, and crop failures
were widespread in North America and Europe, the so-
called ‘‘year without a summer’’ [Stommel and Stommel,
1983]. More importantly from the perspective of inferring
the time constant of the system, recovery ensued in just a
few years. From an analysis of the rate of recovery of global
mean temperature to baseline conditions between a series of
closely spaced volcanic eruptions between 1880 and 1920,
Lindzen and Giannitsis [1998] argued that the time constant
characterizing this recovery must be short; the range of time
constants consistent with the observations was 2 to 7 a, with
values at the lower end of the range being more compatible
with the observations. A time constant of about 2.6 a is
inferred from the transient climate sensitivity and system
heat capacity determined by Boer et al. [2007] in coupled
climate model simulations of GMST following the Mount
Pinatubo eruption. Comparable estimates of the time con-
stant have been inferred in similar analyses by others [e.g.,
Santer et al., 2001; Wigley et al., 2005]. There are thus
numerous lines of evidence that the timescale characterizing
global climate change might be as short as just a few years,
as obtained by the present analysis. A concern noted by
several investigators with inferences of system time con-
stant from GMST following volcanic eruptions is that as the
duration of the forcing is short, the response time of the
system may not be reflective of that which would charac-
terize a sustained forcing such as that from increased
greenhouse gases because of lack of penetration of the
thermal signal into the deep ocean.
[27] The relaxation time constant of Earth’s climate
system determined from this analysis, t = 5 ± 1 a, is
essentially the same as that given by the energy balance
model in the absence of feedbacks (section 3), t0 = 5 ± 2 a.
This result would seem to be indicative of little net feedback
inherent in Earth’s climate system.
[28] A potential concern with the present approach to
infer the time constant of the climate system arises from the
detrending that was applied to the time series for GMST to
remove the long-term autocorrelation arising from the long-
term increase in GMST over the period of the measure-
ments. Has the detrending, by imposing a high-pass filter on
the data, resulted in a value of t that is artificially short? To
examine this I carried out the same analysis on the non-
detrended data as on the detrended data. As expected, this
analysis resulted in estimates of the relaxation time constant
that were substantially greater than the estimate obtained
with the detrended data. However, these estimates differed
substantially for different subsets of the data: 15–17 a for
each of the data sets as a whole, 6 to 7 a for the first half of
the time series (1880–1942), and 8–10 a for the second half
of the data set (1943–2004). This dependence of t on the
time period examined suggests that the time constant
obtained with the nondetrended data is not an intrinsic
property of the climate system but does indeed reflect the
long-term autocorrelation in the data that results from the
increase in GMST over the time period for which the data
exist. For this reason I proceed in the further analysis using
only the time constant obtained with the detrended data set.
5. Equilibrium Sensitivity of Earth’s Climate
System
[29] The independent determinations of the effective heat
capacity (16.7 ± 7 W a m2 K1, section 3) and time
constant (5 ± 1 a, section 4) of Earth’s climate system allow
evaluation of the equilibrium sensitivity ls
1 of Earth’s
climate system pertinent to climate change on the multi-
decadal timescale by equation (14). The resulting climate
sensitivity is 0.30 ± 0.14 K/(W m2); for forcing
corresponding to doubled CO2 taken as F2 = 3.7 W
m2, the corresponding equilibrium increase in global mean
surface temperature for doubled CO2, is DT2  1.1 ±
0.3 K. (These and other results are summarized in Table 3.)
This climate sensitivity is much lower than current esti-
mates, e.g., the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC, 2007], DT2 

here is much shorter than that characterizing climate re-

sponse in studies with coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs
noted above [Wetherald et al., 2001; Meehl et al., 2005;
Hansen et al., 2005; Wigley, 2005], the values of time
constant and the climate sensitivity are in fairly close
agreement with values from a zero-dimensional energy
transfer model coupled to an upwelling diffusion ocean
model [Dickinson and Schaudt, 1998], which yielded an
impulse response time of 5 a and equilibrium response to
CO2 doubling DT2  2 K.
6. Climate Forcing and Temperature Change
Over the Twentieth Century
[31] The rather short time constant of the climate system
determined by this analysis implies that the climate system
is in near equilibrium with the applied forcing. Hence the
total forcing of the climate system over a given time period
F can be determined empirically from knowledge of the
change in GMST over that period DTs as F = DTs/ls
1 with
little error resulting from lag of GMST response to the
forcing. Here I determine the total forcing over the twentieth
century F20 for which period the change in GMST DTs,20 is
given by Folland et al. [2001] as 0.57 ± 0.085 K (1-sigma);
this time period is chosen to be sufficiently long that the
uncertainty in DTs (±15%) contributes relatively little to the
uncertainty in inferred total forcing over the time period,
although it is recognized that change in forcing and GMST
has not been constant over this period. The total forcing of
the climate system over this period inferred in this way is
F20 = 1.9 ± 0.9 W m
2; this value may be compared to the
total greenhouse gas forcing over the twentieth century,
FG,20 = 2.2 ± 0.3 W m
2 [IPCC, 2001, Figure 6.8]. As a
consistency check the average forcing of 0.019 W m2 a1
over the twentieth century together with the 5-a lag in
temperature relative to forcing (equation (13)) yields a lag
in temperature of 0.03 K. It would thus appear that there is
very little unrealized warming as a consequence of ‘‘thermal
inertia’’ of the climate system, so for all practical purposes
the climate system can be considered in steady state (or
‘‘equilibrium’’) with the applied forcing.
[32] The difference DF20 between the total forcing in-
ferred empirically from climate sensitivity and the calculat-
ed forcing due to changes in greenhouse gases must be
ascribed to forcing by other influences on longwave or
shortwave radiation over the twentieth century; i.e., DF20 =
F20  FG,20 = 0.30 ± 0.97 W m2. Consideration of
secular changes in forcing over the twentieth century is
aided by the fact that forcing by volcanic aerosols, as
estimated by Ammann et al. [2003], was quite small
(0.02 W m2) at both ends of the century. Although the
central value of the additional forcing is small compared to
greenhouse gas forcing over the twentieth century, the
uncertainty range extends to include either substantial cool-
ing (1.3 W m2) or substantial warming (+0.7 W m2).
The most likely candidate for much of this additional
forcing would be shortwave direct and indirect forcing by
tropospheric aerosols [Gregory et al., 2002; Andreae et al.,
2005] although forcing by all other changes in the climate
system must be taken into account [Rodhe et al., 2000], of
which the most likely class would appear to be changes in
surface albedo [Feddema et al., 2005]. The upper limit
(one-sigma) of the (negative) forcing by tropospheric aero-
sols obtained in this way, 1.3 W m2, is consistent with
other estimates of this forcing by ‘‘inverse calculations’’
[Anderson et al., 2003] and is broadly consistent with the
range of estimates of this forcing by IPCC [2007] within the
quite high uncertainty of those estimates, but is substantially
less than some estimates of this forcing by ‘‘forward
calculations’’ obtained with aerosol loadings calculated with
chemical transport models [Anderson et al., 2003].
[33] The rapid equilibration of Earth’s climate system to
applied forcings implies that forcings by individual forcing
agents over a specified time period contribute to changes in
GMST over that time period and that these temperature
changes may be considered additive to yield the total
change in GMST, just as the individual forcings are con-
sidered additive to yield the total forcing. Thus the green-
house gas forcing over the twentieth century of FG,20 results
in an increase in GMST of 0.66 ± 0.32 K. Within the
uncertainty range associated with the forcings the increase
in GMST due to greenhouse gases may be substantially
offset by a countervailing decrease in GMST of as much as
0.38 K (one-sigma) due to other forcings. If this temperature
decrease is due to tropospheric aerosols a consequence
would be that if emissions of these aerosols and their
precursors were abruptly decreased, resulting in the forcing
by these aerosols decreasing quite rapidly on account of
their very short atmospheric residence time (about a week),
GMST would be expected to rapidly increase to a new,
higher value. While the possibility of such a hypothetical
increase in GMST following cessation of emissions of
tropospheric aerosols and precursor gases has been noted
in previous studies [Andreae et al., 2005; Brasseur and
Roeckner, 2005], neither study recognized the rapidity of
the increase in GMST that would be expected. In contrast an
abrupt decrease in emissions of CO2 would result in only
minimal decrease in GMST because of the long lifetime
(	100 a) associated with excess atmospheric CO2.
7. Discussion, Conclusions, and Implications
[34] The findings of the present study may be considered
surprising in several respects:
[35] 1. The relatively small effective heat capacity of the
global ocean that is coupled to the increase in global mean
surface temperature over the 5-decade period for which
ocean heat content measurements are available, 14 ±
6 W a m2 K1 (0.44 G J m2 K1), equivalent to about
150 m of the world ocean, and the correspondingly low
effective planetary heat capacity C, 16.7 ± 7.0 W a m2 K1
(0.5 ± 0.2 G J m2 K1).
[36] 2. The relaxation time constant of global mean
surface temperature in response to perturbations t is short,
5 ± 1 a.
[37] 3. The equilibrium climate sensitivity ls
1 inferred
from (1) and (2) as ls
1 = t/C, 0.30 ± 0.14 K/(W m2) is
low, equivalent to equilibrium temperature increase for
doubled CO2 DT2 = 1.1 ± 0.5 K. This value is well below
current best estimates of this quantity, summarized in the
Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC [2007] to be ‘‘2 to
4.5 K with a best estimate of about 3 K and . . . very
unlikely to be less than 1.5 K.’’
D24S05 SCHWARTZ: SENSITIVITY OF EARTH’S CLIMATE SYSTEM

D24S05
[38] This situation invites a scrutiny of the each of these
findings for possible sources of error of interpretation in the
present study.
[39] Is the effective heat capacity that is coupled to the
climate system, as determined from trends in ocean heat
content and GMST, too low, or too high? For a given
relaxation time constant t, a lower value of C would result
in a greater climate sensitivity, and vice versa. As noted
above previous investigators have used similar considera-
tions to suggest different values for C, in one instance
substantially greater than the value reported here (20–50 W
a m2 K1) and in one instance with a range of a factor of
20, (3.2–65 W a m2 K1) that encompasses the value
determined here. Examination of Figure 4 suggests that it
would be hard to justify a slope less than about 8Wam2 K1.
Perhaps a more fundamental question has to do with the
representativeness of the data that comprise the Levitus et
al. [2005] compilation. In this context it might be noted that
Willis et al. [2004] reported a heat uptake rate in the upper
750 m of the ocean, based on satellite altimetry as well as in
situ measurements, of 0.86 ± 0.12 W m2, a factor of
7 greater than the Levitus et al. [2005] average for 1958–
1995; a greater heat uptake rate would result in a greater
effective ocean heat capacity and a lower climate sensitivity.
However, in a subsequent publication a year later Lyman et
al. [2006] reported a rapid net loss of ocean heat for 2003–
2005 that led those investigators to estimate the heat uptake
rate for 1993–2005 as 0.33 ± 0.23 W m2, a value much
more consistent with the long-term record in the Levitus et
al. [2005] data set. The previous instances of several-year
periods of net loss of heat from the ocean exhibited in the
Levitus et al. [2005] data and shown in Figure 2 suggest the
necessity of evaluating the effective heat capacity based on
a long-term record.
[40] Is the relaxation time constant of the climate system
determined by autocorrelation analysis the pertinent time
constant of the climate system? Of the several assumptions
on which the present analysis rests, this would seem to
invite the greatest scrutiny. A possible explanation for the
short time constant inferred from the autocorrelation
analysis might be that the autocorrelation is dominated by
short-term variability, such as that resulting from volcanic
eruptions, and that the thermal signal from such a short
perturbations would not be expected to penetrate substan-
tially into the deep ocean. Two considerations would speak
against such an explanation. First, the autocorrelation lead-
ing to the 5-a time constant extended out to lag times of 15 a
or more with little indication of increased time constant for
lag time greater than about 5–8 a (Figure 6). Also, recent
studies with coupled ocean atmosphere GCMs have shown
that the thermal signal from even a short-duration volcanic
event is transported into the deep ocean and can persist for
decades [Delworth et al., 2005; Gleckler et al., 2006a,
2006b]; such penetration of the thermal signal from a
short-duration forcing would suggest that the autocorrela-
tion of GMST over a decade or more would be represen-
tative of the longer time constant associated with the
coupling to the deep ocean and not reflective simply of a
short time constant associated with the ocean mixed layer.
[41] Finally, as the present analysis rests on a simple
single-compartment energy balance model, the question
must inevitably arise whether the rather obdurate climate
system might be amenable to determination of its key
properties through empirical analysis based on such a
simple model. In response to that question it might have
to be said that it remains to be seen. In this context it is
hoped that the present study might stimulate further work
along these lines with more complex models. It might also
prove valuable to apply the present analysis approach to the
output of global climate models to ascertain the fidelity with
which these models reproduce ‘‘whole Earth’’ properties of
the climate system such as are empirically determined here.
Ultimately of course the climate models are essential to
provide much more refined projections of climate change
than would be available from the global mean quantities that
result from an analysis of the present sort. Still it would
seem that empirical examination of these global mean
quantities, effective heat capacity, time constant, and sensi-
tivity, can usefully constrain climate models and thereby
help to identify means for improving the confidence in these
models.
[42] The empirical determinations presented here of global
heat capacity and of the time constant of climate response to
perturbations on the multidecadal timescale lead to a value
of equilibrium global climate sensitivity of 0.30 ± 0.14 K/
(W m2), where the uncertainty range denotes a one-sigma
estimate. This sensitivity together with the increase in
global mean surface temperature over the twentieth century
would imply a total forcing 1.9 ± 0.9 W m2; although the
central value of this range is fairly close to the total
greenhouse gas forcing over this time period, 2.2 W m2,
this result is consistent with an additional forcing over the
twentieth century of 0.30 ± 0.97 W m2. The rather large
uncertainty range could be consistent with either substantial
cooling forcing (1.3 W m2) or substantial warming
forcing (+0.7 W m2), with aerosol forcing a likely major
contributor. Because of the short response time of the
climate system to perturbations, the climate system may
be considered in near steady state to applied forcings and
hence, within the linear forcing-response model, the change
in temperature over a given time period may be apportioned
to the several forcings. The estimated increase in GMST by
well mixed greenhouse gases from preindustrial times to the
present, 0.7 ± 0.3 K; the upper end of this range approaches
the threshold for ‘‘dangerous anthropogenic interference
with the climate system,’’ which is considered to be in the
range 1 to 2 K [O’Neill and Oppenheimer, 2002; Hansen,
2004].
