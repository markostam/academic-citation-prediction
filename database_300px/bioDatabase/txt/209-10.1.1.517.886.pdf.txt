ABSTRACT
Rfam is a collection of multiple sequence alignments
and covariance models representing non-coding
RNA families. Rfam is available on the web in the
UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/ and
in the US at http://rfam.wustl.edu/. These websites
allow the user to search a query sequence against a
library of covariance models, and view multiple
sequence alignments and family annotation. The
database can also be downloaded in ﬂatﬁle form and
searched locally using the INFERNAL package
(http://infernal.wustl.edu/). The ﬁrst release of Rfam
(1.0) contains 25 families, which annotate over 50 000
non-coding RNA genes in the taxonomic divisions of
the EMBL nucleotide database.
INTRODUCTION
Non-coding RNA genes produce a functional RNA molecule as
a final product, rather than a translated protein. Current gene-
finding methods largely ignore non-coding RNA genes, yet they
produce some of the cell’s most important products—transfer
RNA and ribosomal RNA are two of the well-known examples.
The number of known RNA genes is expanding rapidly due to
the deluge of genomic data, but also aided by recent systematic
efforts to detect RNA genes [reviewed in (1–3)].
Just like protein coding genes ncRNAs fall into families that
have evolved from a common ancestor. By making alignments
of these families of ncRNA genes we can learn about their
structure and function. Indeed, accurate prediction of RNA
secondary structure relies on multiple sequence alignments to
provide data on co-varying bases (4). Ribosomal RNA
alignments are used to make molecular phylogenies that guide
taxonomic classification of all species (5).
Many RNA sequence families conserve a consensus base-
paired secondary structure. Standard primary sequence
analysis tools [such as BLAST (6) for database searches and
CLUSTALW (7) for multiple alignment] are useful for closely
related RNAs, but recognition and alignment of more distantly
related structural RNAs is greatly aided by consensus
secondary structure information. Historically, structure-based
RNA sequence analysis has been difficult to automate. Most
RNA structural alignments are the product of expert manual
curation. Recent software advances (8) using secondary
structure profiles called ‘covariance models’ (CMs—also
called profile stochastic context-free grammars) (1,9) have
led us to begin the development and automated maintenance of
a database of structural RNA alignments. This is analogous to
the use of profile hidden Markov models of primary sequence
consensus in the development and maintenance of thousands
of protein sequence alignments in the Pfam database (10).
Several databases already exist that contain RNA alignments
and information—for example, the European Large Subunit
Ribosomal RNA Database (11), the SRP database (12), the
uRNA database (13), the Comparative RNA Web (14), and
others (15–22). These databases are well curated and provide a
large amount of information to the specialist. However, they
vary greatly in the file formats used and the data presented.
There are also several specialised computational tools to aid
identification of specific RNA types. For example, tRNAscan-
SE is a standard tool in the genome annotation field for
identifying tRNA genes with extremely high sensitivity and
specificity (23). A recent report describes a new tool, BRUCE,
which aims to predict tmRNA genes in genomic sequence (24).
However, the RNA analysis field lacks any analogue to the
comprehensive secondary sequence databases that greatly aid
protein annotation, such as Pfam (10), SMART (25) and
Prosite (26).
The aims of the Rfam database are (i) to integrate the many
existing curated structural RNA alignments (in addition to new
alignments) into a common structure-annotated format,
analogous to Pfam’s curated seed alignments; (ii) to use
covariance model software to search the growing sequence
databases and maintain automatically-generated alignments of
all detectable homologues, analogous to Pfam’s automatically-
generated full alignments; and (iii) to provide a system for
automatically analysing and annotating sequences (including
complete genome sequences) for the presence of homologues
to known structural RNAs, analogous to the public Pfam
search servers.
METHODS
Each family in Rfam is represented by two multiple sequence
alignments and a covariance model. The seed alignment

contains known representative members of the family, is hand-
curated, and is annotated with structural information. The
seed alignment is used to build a covariance model using
the CMBUILD program from the INFERNAL suite (http://
infernal.wustl.edu/) (8). The model is then used to search a
nucleotide sequence database using the CMSEARCH
program. CMSEARCH reports scores for matches to the
model, and a family-specific threshold is chosen such that we
believe no false positives fall above the threshold. The matches
are then aligned to the model using the CMALIGN program.
The nucleotide database searched is called RFAMSEQ, and
is built from a subset of the EMBL nucleotide database (27).
RFAMSEQ 1 is based on EMBL release 71. RFAMSEQ
includes the ‘finished’ portion of EMBL distributed in the
organism specific data files, and excludes the EST, GSS, HTG,
HTC, STS and patent sections of the database. Despite these
exclusions, RFAMSEQ 1 contains 1 075 317 sequences and
over 5.3 billion bases. CM searches are particularly compu-
tationally expensive, with a small model (such as tRNA)
searching around 200 bases per second on a 600 MHz Compaq
ALPHA. A full CM search of RFAMSEQ with one small
model would take around 300 cpu days. The search time scales
roughly with the cube of the query consensus length, so this
quickly becomes entirely infeasible for larger RNAs. We,
therefore, employ an initial BLAST search (6) with relaxed
search parameters to reduce the search space. All BLAST hits
with P-value <10 to a member of the seed alignment are
retrieved, a family specific window size added to each end of
the matches, and the reduced database subjected to a full CM
search. This approach is similar to that employed by the
tRNAscan-SE program which uses an heuristic first step
followed by full covariance model search (23), but is generally
applicable to any ncRNA search. We anticipate that techno-
logical and software improvements will in the future allow us
to conduct full CM searches to build family alignments.
AVAILABILITY
Rfam is available on the web at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
Software/Rfam/ in the UK, and http://rfam.wustl.edu/ in the
US. The database is also available in flatfile format for local
installation. To search Rfam locally, the user will also need the
INFERNAL software suite, available from http://infernal.
wustl.edu/. Table 1 shows a list of families contained in
Rfam 1.0. These families annotate over 50 000 ncRNAs in the
RFAMSEQ database.
WEBSITE FEATURES
The Rfam websites have been designed to be intuitive to use—
users of the Pfam database of protein families will recognise
the layout and format of the database. The websites provide the
facility to search a DNA sequence against the library of CMs.
The user can view annotation on each RNA family, and follow
links to other databases and literature references. The multiple
sequence alignments on which Rfam is based are available in a
number of formats for viewing in a browser or for down-
loading. Both the seed and full alignments contain secondary
structure mark-up to describe the base-paired positions in the
member sequences, and the web view provides a colour-
encoded representation of these co-varying columns (Fig. 1).
In addition the web pages allow the user to quickly determine
the species distribution within a family.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Rfam is under active development and will increase sig-
nificantly in size and scope over the next 12 months. Novel
ncRNA genes are being discovered at a rapid rate, and we aim
to quickly translate such discoveries into useful and searchable
RNA families. However, we recognise a number of limitations
with our approach. The most obvious of these is the
computational cost of using CMs. We predict that technolo-
gical advances will soon make these searches far more feasible,
and will allow full CM genome-wide searches for ncRNAs
using Rfam. Until such a time narrowing the search space
using BLAST greatly facilitates such searches, though at an
inevitable and unknown cost in search sensitivity. In addition,
there are RNA families that we cannot model using the
alignment- and profile-based approach at present—for exam-
ple, microRNAs (miRNA precursor secondary structures are
only vaguely similar stem-loops) and many small nucleolar
RNAs (the consensus of modification guide snoRNAs includes

Despite such limitations, the Rfam library of alignments and
CMs provides a useful tool for genome annotation, as well as a
comprehensive resource for RNA family information and
multiple sequence alignments.
