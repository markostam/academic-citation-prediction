ABSTRACT
There are abundance of transcripts that code for
no particular protein and that remain functionally
uncharacterized. Some of these transcripts may
have novel functions while others might be junk
transcripts. Unfortunately, the experimental valida-
tion of such transcripts to find functional non-
coding RNA candidates is very costly. Therefore,
our primary interest is to computationally mine
candidate functional transcripts from a pool of
uncharacterized transcripts. We introduce fRNAdb:
a novel database service that hosts a large collec-
tion of non-coding transcripts including annotated/
non-annotated sequences from the H-inv database,
NONCODE and RNAdb. A set of computational
analyses have been performed on the included
sequences. These analyses include RNA secondary
structure motif discovery, EST support evaluation,
cis-regulatory element search, protein homology
search, etc. fRNAdb provides an efficient interface
to help users filter out particular transcripts under
their own criteria to sort out functional RNA
candidates. fRNAdb is available at http://www.
ncrna.org/
INTRODUCTION
fRNAdb is a database that helps in annotating non-coding
transcripts acquired from publicly available databases.
H-inv: human full-length non-coding cDNAs (1); NON-
CODE: experimentally validated non-coding transcripts (2);
and RNAdb: non-coding transcripts curated from the litera-
ture, human chromosome 7 project, and RIKEN antisense
pipeline and other putative non-coding RNAs (3). Details
are shown in Table 1. Each transcript is analyzed for various
features such as maximum ORF length, the number of protein
homologs, the average conservation score, transcription regu-
latory element motifs, existence of CpG islands and so on
(listed in Table 2) that help in filtering out promising non-
coding candidates. Transcripts can be filtered with fRNAdb’s
main listing interface in many different ways (see Figure 1).
This main listing interface is linked to our custom UCSC
Genome Browser (4) for functional RNAs equipped with
our RNA-specific original custom tracks that are specific to
screening of functional RNA. Users can inspect a transcript
of interest from a genomic view with rich genomic informa-
tion surrounding the mapped transcript. The information
includes the UCSC original tracks such as known genes, gen-
ome conservation and Affymetrix transcriptome tracks (5),
and our original tracks such as conserved potential secondary
structure, existence of known RNA secondary structure
motifs and significant RNA secondary structure Z-score
regions (for details see Table 3).

35 columns including ones for the attributes described in
Table 2 (Figure 1B). The tabular control panel is placed
above the table, which presents five tabs labeled ‘Basic’,
‘DB/ID’, ‘Expert’, ‘Sort’ and ‘Column’ (Figure 1A). The
Basic tab contains the basic filters: a collection of frequently
used filters that provide simple and quick selection of tran-
scripts that match common criteria of functional non-coding
RNAs. For example, checking ‘Mapped’ to select only
genome-mapped transcripts, ‘Well conserved at best (Max
> 50%)’ for transcripts that have maximum conservation
score >50% among 17 vertebrates (4) in their exonic regions,
‘EST-supported’ for reliable expression evidence, ‘Tiny ORF
(<40 aa)’ enriching for non-coding transcripts, ‘Low Repeat
Coverage (<30%)’ for no repeat element contamination,
‘No protein homolog’ for another condition which enriches
non-coding transcripts, ‘No overlapping known gene’ is for
removing the possibility of being part of a protein-coding
gene transcript. After checking the boxes, the ‘refresh’ button
runs filtering action and presents results. Our example condi-
tions yield nine hits including one H-inv non-protein coding
cDNA and eight RNAdb literature-curated miRNAs. In other
words, these criteria match real functional RNAs and also
indicate that one non-coding transcript shares the same
properties. Clicking on the ID of this transcript produces a
detailed view of this transcript shown in Figure 2. This
feature visualizer shows graphical representation of a vari-
ety of sequence elements found in the transcript including
cis-regulatory elements, repeat elements, EST mapping
regions and six frame stop codon positions. There are many
different ways to filter these non-coding transcripts and
there are many more potential candidates hidden in this
dataset. More details of the basic filters are provided on the
website.
The rest of the tabs offer additional functionality to further
improve usability. The DB/ID tab contains DB selection and
ID selection boxes. The DB selection box allows you to
limit the target databases from currently available databases:
H-inv, NONCODE and RNAdb. The ID selection box lets
you choose target transcripts that match given string patterns.
For example, specifying ‘FR000001’ (fRNAdb ID) in this
box limits the target transcript FR000001 alone. The wild-
card ‘%’ is allowed for pattern matching. Specifying
‘LIT%’ lets you limit the search to targets whose original
IDs start with ‘LIT’. The string pattern is matched against
ID, Acc. and Original columns. The Expert tab provides an
interface to specify multiple conditions that let you perform
more complex filtering than the basic filters. Please refer to
the website for more details about the expert filters. The
Sort tab has a sorting interface that lets you sort the table
with multiple sorting keys. The Column tab allows you to
limit visible columns of the main listing table. Since the
35-column table is too wide for ordinary browsers to display
on a single screen, you can narrow the width of the table
with this interface for better visibility.

UCSC GENOME BROWSER FOR
FUNCTIONAL RNAs
We mirrored the UCSC Genome Browser and added our
custom tracks specific to functional RNAs and miRNAs as
shown in Tables 3 and 4. Most of the tracks have their
own sources and reference papers. Our original tracks are
RNA clusters, Rfam seed folds, tRNAscan-SE, Ultra
Conserved Elements 17way and Z-score (details are shown
in Table 3). Besides, we mapped RNA sequences from public
functional RNA sequence databases including Erdmann (6),
NONCODE, RNAdb and Rfam. The UCSC Genome Browser
has several tracks for miRNA genes and targets but we added
more tracks including miRBase (7) known miRNA genes,
miRNAMap (8) and Berezikov’s predicted miRNA genes
(9), TarBase (10) known miRNA targets, and predicted
miRNA targets from RNAhybrid (11), PicTar 4 species and
5 species (12), miRBase targets and T-ScanS miRNA targets
Figure 1. The first page shows a set of selection interfaces (A) and the listing table of 13 693 transcripts (B).

(13). Our custom tracks can be downloaded by using
Table browser which can be accessed via ‘Table’ menu of
the UCSC Genome Browser.
In the near future, fRNAdb will include more transcripts
from other sequence databases or non-coding gene prediction
results. For example, Human Accelerated Region (14) is
currently included as our custom track of the Genome Brow-
ser. Sequences of these non-coding gene candidates will
be included in fRNAdb. We will also add more attributes to
fRNAdb. Especially attributes representing expression patterns
of the transcripts or protein genes related to the transcripts.
