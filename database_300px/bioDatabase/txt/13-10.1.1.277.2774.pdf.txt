ABSTRACT
Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) is a structure-specific
nuclease best known for its involvement in RNA
primer removal and long-patch base excision repair.
This enzyme is known to possess 50-flap endo- (FEN)
and 50–30 exo- (EXO) nuclease activities. Recently,
FEN-1 has been reported to also possess a gap endo-
nuclease (GEN) activity, which is possibly involved in
apoptotic DNA fragmentation and the resolution of
stalled DNA replication forks. In the current study,
we compare the kinetics of these activities to shed
light on the aspects of DNA structure and FEN-1
DNA-binding elements that affect substrate cleavage.
By using DNA binding deficient mutants of FEN-1, we
determine that the GEN activity is analogous to FEN
activity in that the single-stranded DNA region of DNA
substrates interacts with the clamp region of FEN-1. In
addition, we show that the C-terminal extension of
human FEN-1 likely interacts with the downstream
duplex portion of all substrates. Taken together, a
substrate-binding model that explains how FEN-1,
which has a single active center, can have seemingly
different activities is proposed. Furthermore,
based on the evidence that GEN activity in complex
with WRN protein cleaves hairpin and internal loop
substrates, we suggest that the GEN activity may
prevent repeat expansions and duplication
mutations.
INTRODUCTION
Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) is a multifunctional structure-
specific nuclease involved in various nucleic acid metabolic
pathways (1–3). The enzyme possesses 50-flap endo- (FEN)
and 50–30 exonuclease (EXO) activities that are critical for
RNA primer removal during lagging strand DNA synthesis
and long-patch base excision repair (lpBER) (4–6). In addi-
tion, some evidence suggests that FEN-1 is involved in HIV
replication (7), non-homologous end joining repair (8), sup-
pression of short sequence recombination (9) and homologous
recombination (10). A RAD27 (FEN-1 homolog) null mutation
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in retarded growth and
increased sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate, which are
consistent with the role of FEN-1 in DNA replication and
repair (11,12). In addition, the RAD27 null mutants display
a strong mutator phenotype in that the duplication mutations
are significantly increased and tracts of repetitive sequences
become highly unstable (13–17).
Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans surprisingly revealed
that the FEN-1 homolog (CRN-1) promotes apoptotic DNA
degradation in collaboration with the EndoG homolog CPS-6,
which is a mitochondrial endonuclease known to be involved
in apoptotic DNA fragmentation (18). Besides the previously
described FEN and EXO nuclease activities, CeFEN-1 was
shown to possess a gap endonuclease activity, which could be
stimulated by CeEndoG (CPS-6). Based on these data,
CeFEN-1 and CeEndoG were proposed to function cooperat-
ively in apoptotic DNA degradation (18). Recently, human
FEN-1 (hFEN-1) was also shown to possess a GEN activity
similar to its C.elegans counterpart (19). It was shown that
hFEN-1 cleaves DNA structures resembling stalled replication
forks using its GEN activity. In addition, the Werner syndrome
protein (WRN), which is a RecQ helicase family protein
known to stimulate the FEN and EXO activities of hFEN-1,
was shown to stimulate the GEN activity of hFEN-1 to cleave
stalled replication fork substrates. Further studies in yeast
demonstrated that the UV irradiation sensitivity of rad27
null mutant was alleviated by expression of wild-type
hFEN-1, but could not be complemented by the hFEN-1

mutants E160D or E178A, which show a deficiency in GEN
activity with little effect on the FEN activity (19). Taken
together, these results suggested that FEN1 might be involved
in break-induced repair of stalled replication forks. Interest-
ingly, FEN-1 expression was shown to be up-regulated in
mouse fibroblast cells upon UV exposure in a p53 dependent
manner, presumably to assist in stalled replication fork rescue.
Furthermore, over-expression of FEN-1 can rescue
p53-deficient cells from UV exposure (20).
The X-ray structure analysis and biochemical studies of
FEN-1 have provided some insights into how FEN-1 selects
and cleaves its DNA substrates (21–24). The global structure
of archaeal and human FEN-1 consists of the nuclease core
domain and C-terminal extension (Figure 1). Within the
nuclease core domain, three major FEN-1 motifs that mediate
interaction with DNA substrates have been identified via site-
directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses (21,25)
(Figure 1). The positively charged groove formed by Helix–
3Turn–Helix motif (H3TH, containing residues Lys244,
Arg245, Lys252 and Lys254 in hFEN-1) has been identified
as the site that binds the duplex DNA downstream from the
FEN or EXO cleavage site. The helices and loops on the other
side of the active center groove (containing residues Arg70,
Lys326 and Arg327 in hFEN-1) form another positively charged
groove that binds to the upstream duplex DNA, which is
defined as the duplex portion upstream of the DNA cleavage
site. The 3D structure of FEN-1 and FRET analysis suggest
that the two duplex DNA arms must kink or bend to bind
simultaneously (21). A small hydrophobic pocket near the
hydrophobic wedge that stacks with the 30-face of the upstream
duplex DNA interacts with a single nucleotide 30 flap that can
further position the flap substrate, thereby ensuring that FEN-1
cleaves exactly 1 nucleotide (nt) into the downstream duplex
(21,26). The final DNA-binding motif within FEN-1 is the
‘helical clamp’ region (also called ‘arch’), which consists
mainly of charged and hydrophobic amino acid residues
that are thought to mediate the interaction with the single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) flap of 50-flap DNA substrates
(21,22). In the absence of DNA binding, the clamp region
is relatively far from the active center and is partly disordered
(24). However, the binding of the upstream duplex DNA along
with a single-nucleotide 30 flap to FEN-1 is thought to trigger a
conformational change in FEN-1 that results in the disordered
loops to form a-helices (21). This is consistent with previous
report of increased helical content in FEN-1 upon DNA bind-
ing (27). In addition, such a conformational rearrangement is
suspected to bring some residues such as Arg100 in the clamp
region closer to the active center and to allow them to parti-
cipate in catalysis (25,28). The C-terminal extensions of
FEN-1s from archaea to humans contain a conserved short
sequence motif (Q-x-x-L-D-x-F-F) that is required for high
affinity interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) in vitro. The C-terminal extension in human
FEN-1 was revealed to be also involved in DNA substrate
binding (29). However, it is still unclear which part of the
DNA substrate the C-terminus interacts.
Although FEN-1 possesses three activities that vary in
efficacy, the crystal structures of archaebacterial and human

FEN-1 show that FEN-1s have only one active center to perform
these various cleavages. How FEN-1 can cleave various sub-
strates and why the three activities vary so widely in efficacy are
unknown. In this study, we have sought to determine the reasons
for the above questions using extensive kinetic and mutational
analysis with various DNA substrates. We have devised a gen-
eral DNA substrate-binding model that explains how the single
active center of FEN-1 can perform cleavage on various sub-
strates. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of the WRN protein
on the GEN activity of FEN-1 as an example as to how other
proteins can stimulate the relatively weak in vitro activities of
FEN-1 to physiologically relevant levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Human FEN-1 protein and WRN protein expression and puri-
fication were performed as described previously (25,30). Pro-
tein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using
BSA to generate a standard curve. DNA oligos were synthes-
ized at the City of Hope DNA/RNA/peptide synthesis core
facility and purified by denaturing PAGE. The oligo concen-
trations were determined using A260 and calculated extinction
coefficients. Oligos used to build various DNA substrates are
shown in Table 1.
Three-dimensional structure modeling of hFEN-1/DNA
complexes
The hFEN-1 model (Figure 1) was constructed using initial
coordinates from the crystal structure of hFEN-1 (Molecule Z)
bound to PCNA (PDB code 1UL1) (24). The DNA substrate
backbone was then positioned onto the FEN-1 model based on
previous DNA–FEN-1 interaction models (21,25). Because
the hFEN-1 structure is based on a DNA-free and PCNA-
tethered FEN-1 state, this figure is not a precise interaction
model.
DNA substrate preparation
DNA substrate preparation was performed as described
previously (25). Briefly, oligos were labeled with ddATP at
the 30 end by incubating 40 pmol of the oligo with 15 mCi of
[a-32P]ddATP and 1 ml (400 U/ml) of terminal transferase
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at 37C for 60 min. The enzyme
was then inactivated by heating at 72C for 10 min. To make
substrates, 80 pmol of cold oligos were added to 40 pmol of
radiolabled oligo (Table 1 and Figure 2) and heated for 7 min
followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Substrates
were precipitated by ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol and
resuspended in water. The schematic configurations for all the
substrates used in this study are shown in Figure 2.
FEN-1 nuclease activity assays
Reactions were carried out with the indicated amount of
hFEN-1 and 40 nM DNA substrates in reaction buffer con-
taining 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mg/ml
BSA and 1 mM DTT in a final volume of 10 ml. Reactions
were incubated at 37C for 15 min and terminated by adding
2 vol of stop-solution (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05%
bromophenol blue and 0.05% xylene cyanol). Reactions were
analyzed on a 7 M urea, 15% denaturing PAGE in 1· TBE.
Gels were dried, and bands were visualized by phosphorimager
analysis (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
Kinetic analyses
Steady-state kinetic studies of human FEN-1 were performed
at 37C under the standard conditions described in the enzyme
assay. Varying concentrations of DNA substrates (5, 10, 20,
40 and 80 nM) (final) and a constant amount of FEN1 for
each reaction were utilized. Assays were performed at least in
triplicate. Reactions were initiated by adding FEN-1 to the
reaction mixture, and 10 ml aliquots were removed at 0, 0.5, 1,
1.5, 2 and 2.5 min and immediately mixed with 20 ml of 4C
stop-solution. Under our experimental conditions, the cleav-
age percentage in each reaction was <10%. The initial velocity
was calculated according the equation v ¼ d[P]/dt, where [P]
is the product concentration in nM and t is the reaction time
in seconds. The product concentration was calculated by
the equation [P] ¼ {IP/(IS+IP)} · [initial substrate], where
IP ¼ product intensity and IS ¼ remaining substrate intensity.
The Km and Vmax values were derived from Lineweaver–Burk
plot (1/v  1/s). kcat was calculated using the equation
kcat ¼ Vmax/[E], where [E] is the enzyme concentration in
the reaction. The raw data of kinetic analyses are shown in
supplementary figures.
RESULTS
Characterization of FEN-1 GEN activity on various gap
substrates
FEN-1 was reported previously to possess a GEN activity on
duplex gap substrates (18) and fork gap substrates (19). As
shown in Figure 3, FEN-1 activities on these substrates were

compared with the well-characterized FEN and EXO
activities. FEN-1 cleavage efficiency is DflapT13 >
DforkT13 > ExoT13 > GapT13. As can be seen using the
ExoT13 substrate, the 50–30 EXO activity of FEN-1 pro-
cessively digests the downstream primer (downstream and
upstream are defined based on the cleavage site, as mentioned
previously), but stops when the downstream duplex is 10 bp.
This suggests that FEN-1 has a minimum length requirement
for the downstream duplex DNA region when performing
exonuclease activity (Figure 1). If the 32P-radiolabel on the
ExoT13 substrate is changed to the template strand (i.e.
GapT13), it is observed that FEN-1 utilizes a GEN activity
that is less efficient than EXO activity. Therefore, FEN-1,
which has only one active center, has two different activities
varying in efficacy on a single DNA substrate (ExoT13 and
GapT13; Figure 2B and C).
Parrish et al. (18) reported that C.elegans FEN-1 displays
better GEN activity on gap substrates having a gap size of 4 nt
compared with 2 or 1 nt gap substrates. Because only a few gap
sizes were assayed, we sought to more comprehensively deter-
mine the effect of gap size on the GEN activity of human
FEN-1. We designed two series of substrates (duplex gap
substrates and fork gap substrates, Figure 4A and B) that
have fixed duplex DNA arms and gap lengths that vary
with the number of dTs between the duplex arms. Preparing
the substrates in this way ensures that the duplex stability is
constant with increasing gap size. Using equivalent amounts of
FEN-1 in each reaction while varying the gap size of the
substrate, the efficiency of GEN activity increases with gap
size (Figure 4A and B). These results indicate that FEN-1’s
GEN activity is more efficient on GEN substrates with larger
ssDNA region. Interestingly, the cleavage site is always at the
ssDNA/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) junction for both series
of substrates regardless of the length of the gap. In addition,
for the duplex gap substrates, the cleavage sites are restricted to
one of the two ssDNA/dsDNA junctions, which indicates that
FEN-1 still selects the ssDNA region with 50–30 polarity similar
to that observed with FEN activity. Based on these observations,
we conclude that cleavage site selection of fork gap and duplex
gap substrate is similar to that of the flap (Figure 3) and
50-overhang substrates (25), respectively. This further suggests
that the ssDNA region of GEN substrates might interact with the
clamp region of FEN-1, which is predicted to interact with
ssDNA flap of FEN substrates (21).
Comparison of the steady-state kinetic parameters of
FEN-1 with various FEN, EXO and GEN substrates
To understand why the cleavage efficiency of FEN-1 activities
(FEN, EXO and GEN) varies so much, we performed
steady-state kinetic analyses of FEN-1 with DflapT13,
FlapT13, Overhang, Nick, ExoT13, DforkT13 and GapT13
substrates (Figure 2, substrates 1–7) by varying substrate con-
centration (5–80 nM for all substrates) while holding the
FEN-1 concentration constant. The kcat value reported here
is comparable with other DNA repair nucleases, such as Sulfo-
lobus solfataricus Hje endonuclease (31), Escherichia coli
endonuclease III and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase
(32). However, it is faster than the kcat of FEN-1 reported
before (25,33,34). This can be explained by the fact that dif-
ferent reaction buffer and temperature are used in these kinetic
assays.
As shown in Table 2, the kcat values for DflapT13, FlapT13
and DforkT13 substrates are similar, suggesting that with
these substrates, the enzyme can perform cleavage optimally.
However, the Km value of fork gap substrate (DforkT13) is
29 times greater than DflapT13 (Table 2), which likely
accounts for the decreased cleavage efficiency (Figure 3).
We do note that there is a small change in kcat between
DforkT13 and DgapT13 that is outside of the range of
error, but it is likely only a minor reason for the difference
in cleavage efficiency between the two substrates. The 50-
overhang substrate (Overhang), which is missing the upstream
duplex of DflapT13, has a Km value 32 times greater. This
highlights the importance of the interaction of FEN-1 with
upstream duplex DNA in substrate binding. As can be seen
by comparing the Km for Nick and FlapT13 substrates, the loss
of the 50-ssDNA flap increases the Km, which indicates that
contacts between FEN-1 and the 50-ssDNA flap stabilize the
FEN-1/flap-DNA complex. In addition, the kcat value for over-
hang and EXO substrates is much smaller than the value for
flap substrates. It is worth noting that the downstream duplex
portion in FEN-1 substrates, which is defined as downstream

(B) and (C), respectively. The arrows indicate the cleavage sites on the DNA
substrates. The names of the oligos that correspond to Table 1 are also shown.

to the cleavage site, is by definition indispensable. Thus,
optimal FEN-1 catalysis and DNA binding requires interaction
with three major DNA elements: 50-ssDNA flap, upstream
duplex and downstream duplex.
Interestingly, the ExoT13 and GapT13 substrates are
the same structures that only differ in the position of the
32P-radiolabel, but our kinetic analyses show that these
two substrates are 15-fold different in Km value although
they are similar in kcat, indicating that the difference in the
ability of the protein to bind these substrates accounts for
the difference in cleavage efficiency. In fact, there are
two different binding modes of FEN-1 with this substrate
as will be demonstrated and discussed below.
Site-directed mutagenesis studies of FEN-1 to determine
how gap substrates bind
In a previous study, we mutated 28 positively charged amino
acids on the surface of human FEN-1 to identify key residues
that are involved in the interaction with flap and nick sub-
strates (25). Residues R70 and K326/R327 are in the region of
FEN-1 that interact with the upstream duplex DNA of flap and
nick substrates. Residues K244/R245 and K252/K254 are part
of the H3TH motif, which interacts with downstream duplex
DNA of flap and nick substrates (Figure 1) (21). Here, we use
the same strategy to determine how FEN-1 binds to GEN
substrates. Four DNA-binding-deficient FEN-1 mutants
(R70A, K326A/R327A, K244A/R245A and K252A/K254A)
were used in cleavage assays with DflapT13, DforkT13,
ExoT13 and GapT13 substrates (Figure 5A). As discussed
above, the ssDNA region of the gap substrates possibly inter-
acts with the clamp region of FEN-1. If this hypothesis is
correct, FEN-1 should bind to the fork gap substrate DforkT13
and double-flap substrate DflapT13 similarly, and mutations
that alter DNA binding should affect FEN-1’s activity on these
two substrates similarly. As shown in Figure 5A, for
DflapT13 and DforkT13 substrates, all mutants show
deficiency in cleavage, indicating that the upstream and
downstream duplex binding regions are important for the
interaction with both substrates. This is consistent with our
hypothesis that FEN-1 binds DforkT13 and DflapT13 simil-
arly (Figure 5B). In addition, all four mutants show decreased
activity with ExoT13 substrate like that seen with the nick
substrate (25), suggesting that FEN-1 binds the up- and down-
stream duplex arms of the ExoT13 like the nick substrate
(Figure 5B). For the duplex gap substrate GapT13, we hypo-
thesized that in addition to binding like an EXO substrate
(ExoT13), the GapT13 substrate can bind FEN-1 in a manner
similar to DforkT13. This alternative mode of binding places
the ssDNA region of GapT13 in the helical clamp region and
the downstream duplex arm on the H3TH motif of FEN-1. As
can be seen in the model (Figure 5B), this orientation retains
the 50–30 polarity of the ssDNA region in the helical clamp and
explains ssDNA/dsDNA cleavage site selection. In addition,
when GapT13 is bound in this orientation, the substrate is
analogous to the 50-overhang substrate (Figure 2A), for
which cleavage is not affected by FEN-1 mutations in the
upstream duplex DNA binding region (25). Mutation of
R70 and K326/R327, but not K252/K254 and K244/R245,
did not impair the cleavage on GapT13 substrate
(Figure 5A), thereby supporting our binding model for the
GapT13 substrate with FEN-1. Thus, the duplex gap substrate,
which can be cleaved as GEN or EXO substrate by FEN-1,
has two modes to bind to FEN-1 (Figure 5B). In one mode
(EXO mode), the duplex DNA arms bind the dsDNA-binding

elements of FEN-1 (R70/K326/R327 element and H3TH
motif), thereby placing the 50 recessed end adjacent to the
active center. In another mode (GEN mode), one duplex
DNA arm interacts with the H3TH motif, and the ssDNA
gap interacts with the helical clamp region, thereby
positioning the ssDNA/dsDNA junction adjacent to the active
center.
The C-terminus stabilizes the interaction of FEN-1 with
the downstream duplex of DNA substrates
The C-terminus of FEN-1 is rich in positively charged residues
and has been shown to participate in DNA binding (29). We
hypothesized previously that C-terminal tail interacts with the
upstream duplex DNA arm of substrates (25). We rationalized
that if the C-terminus interacts with the upstream duplex of
DNA substrates, then removal of the C-terminal tail should
affect cleavage on all substrates except GapT13. Here, we
constructed several FEN-1 C-terminal deletion mutants
(Figure 6A), and assayed for the ability to cleave all four
substrates as above. As shown in Figure 6B, progressive
deletion of the C-terminus of FEN-1 adversely affects cleav-
age of all FEN, EXO and GEN substrates. This characteristic is
similar to mutations in the H3TH motif; therefore, the FEN-1
C-terminus likely interacts with the downstream duplex
portion of substrates in vitro.
FEN-1 cleaves hairpin-flap and internal loop DNA
substrates
During lagging strand DNA replication, polymerase d dis-
places the RNA primer and adjuvant DNA of an Okazaki
fragment to create a flap structure. The displaced flap is usually
removed very rapidly by FEN-1. However, if the flap contains
direct repeat sequences or di-/tri-nucleotide repeats, flaps can
sometimes form hairpins and/or internal loop structures (also
called bubble structures) by slip-pairing before they are
removed (35). If not resolved, these structures can be ligated
into the genome leading to duplication mutations. Evidence
indicating a critical role for FEN-1 in avoiding duplication
mutation came from studies in yeast RAD27/FEN-1 knock-out
mutants, which displayed an increase in the number of
duplication mutations and tri-nucleotide repeat expansions
(13,17). Based on the track-down model, which explains
how FEN-1 recognizes flap DNA substrates, it was thought
that FEN-1 is unable to cleave hairpin-flaps and internal loop
structures due to the lack of a free 50 end in these structures
(36). However, the presence or absence of FEN-1 in yeast cells
made significant difference in the stability of triple repeat

sequences (16). This suggests that FEN-1 may have a more
active role in the maintenance of triple repeat stability. The
GEN activity of FEN-1 is a good candidate mechanism. There-
fore, FEN-1 was assayed in vitro to determine if it could cleave
hairpin-flap and internal loop DNA structures, the intermedi-
ate DNA structures in generating duplication mutations. As
seen in Figure 7, FEN-1 can cleave, albeit weakly, hairpin-flap
and internal loop structures.
The hairpin-flap DNA substrate is similar to the fork gap
substrate, except that the end of flap is a hairpin turn instead of
a blunt ended duplex. Therefore, it is not surprising that the site
and efficiency of FEN-1 cleavage are very similar (Figure 7A).
Moreover, as gap size of the hairpin-flap structure increases
(i.e. shorten the fold-back length), FEN-1 cleavage efficiency
increases as well, similar to that seen with fork gap substrates
(Figure 4B). No cleavage on the 50 end of the hairpin-flap
was detected, which rules out the possibility that this cleavage
of fork gap substrates resulted from FEN-1 using its 50–30
exonuclease activity to processively digest the 50 end to
make an ssDNA flap.
With the internal loop substrate, the site of cleavage is at the
ssDNA/dsDNA junction on the 30 side of the internal loop,
which suggests that FEN-1 binds ssDNA loop with 50–30 polar-
ity. In addition, owing to the high concentration of FEN-1
necessary to observe cleavage, processive exonucleolytic
cleavage occurs post endonucleolytic cleavage (Figure 7B).
Previously, FEN-1 was shown to be unable to cleave internal
loop structures with <12 nt in the loop. In addition, the ability
of FEN-1 to cleave such a substrate increased significantly
when the loop size was increased from 12 to 24 nt (37). To
further understand how the loop size affects FEN-1 cleavage,
we performed FEN-1 assay with substrates of varying loop
sizes (24, 36 and 48 nt). The efficiency of FEN-1 cleavage is
similar for these three substrates, indicating that FEN-1’s
activity on internal loop substrates does not increase once
the loop size is 24 nt or greater.

WRN protein significantly stimulated GEN activity on
hairpin-flap and internal loop substrates
FEN-1 has been shown to have activities on hairpin-flap
and internal loop substrates, although these activities are
less efficient compared with FEN activity in vitro. FEN-1 is
known to interact with 17 different proteins, some of which
modulate FEN-1 nuclease activities (3). Therefore, other
cellular proteins may facilitate cleavage of substrates
in vivo that are poor in vitro substrates. One such FEN-1
interaction partner is the WRN protein, which has been
shown to stimulate FEN-1’s activities (FEN, EXO and
GEN) in vitro (19,30) and to interact with FEN-1 in vivo
(30). WRN is a RecQ helicase possessing helicase and
30–50 exonuclease activities, but its ability to stimulate
FEN-1 solely depends on a conserved non-catalytic domain
(30). To see if WRN can also stimulate FEN-1’s activity on
hairpin-flap and internal loop substrates, we performed FEN-1
assays on these DNA substrates with the WRN protein.
Because no ATP was included in the reaction and WRN
has a very weak exonuclease activity on the DNA with
30 protruding strand (38), the helicase and exonuclease activity
of WRN can be ignored. As shown in Figure 8, WRN signi-
ficantly stimulates (10-fold) FEN-1 cleavage on hairpin-flap
substrate FB10 to a level similar to the cleavage on double flap
substrate DflapT2. FEN-1’s activity on internal loop substrate
IL36 can also be stimulated by WRN (Figure 8). As a control,
BSA did not stimulate cleavage of these substrates (Figure 8).
This suggests that the WRN/FEN-1 may be important to
resolve aberrant DNA structures that can arise during Okazaki
fragment maturation.
DISCUSSION
DNA binding modes and catalytic properties of FEN-1
FEN-1 has long been known as the primary nuclease for
RNA-primer/DNA flap removal in Okazaki fragment matura-
tion and lpBER (4–6). Early mechanistic studies suggested
that FEN-1 recognizes the free 50 end of flap substrates and
then proceeds to track down the flap to the cleavage site. This
track-down model explained how FEN-1 can bypass blocks
such as DNA branch and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum
adducts, but not DNA duplex (39,40). However, recently pub-
lished work (18,19) and the current study have shown that
FEN-1 also possesses a GEN activity. Why GEN activity is
weaker than FEN activity on comparable substrates and how
EXO and GEN substrates are recognized without a free 50 end
is unknown. Here, we present a model based on kinetic and
site-directed mutagenesis data that can explain how flapless
structures like EXO and GEN substrates bind FEN-1. In
addition, our model explains how an enzyme with a single
active center can have seemingly different activities.
Structural studies have revealed that FEN-1 has two
dsDNA-binding regions and an ssDNA-binding region (helical
clamp). Based on previous work, flap DNA substrates were
determined to require all three major DNA binding elements
for optimal cleavage (25). Because the EXO substrates (Nick
Figure 7. FEN-1 cleaves hairpin-flap and internal loop DNA substrates. (A) Substrates with four gap sizes (2,6,10,14) due to flap hairpin formation were assayed with
three concentrations (4, 8 and 16 nM) of FEN-1. (B) Substrates with three internal loop size (24, 36 and 48 nt) were assayed with three concentrations (20, 80 and
200 nM) of FEN-1. The internal loop size was changed by adding dTs between the two duplex arms. The bar graph below represents the relative cleavage fraction for
each substrate and is an average of three independent experiments.

and ExoT13) have no ssDNA 50-flap, they presumably only
need the two duplex DNA-binding regions of FEN-1 for inter-
action. Owing to the loss of the ssDNA flap interaction, an
increased Km is observed for these substrates compared to the
double-flap substrate, suggesting that the ssDNA flap contacts
FEN-1 in the helical clamp for optimal affinity. Interestingly, a
lower kcat is also observed for EXO substrates when compared
with flap or fork substrates (Table 2). As stated before, studies
have shown that FEN-1 conformational changes are induced
upon DNA binding, especially in the clamp region (21,27). In
light of this, the loss of catalytic efficiency suggests that
important structural rearrangements occur in the clamp region
upon ssDNA binding that are required for optimal catalysis.
Interestingly, EXO cleavage is usually one nucleotide into the
downstream duplex DNA region, but to a lesser extent
di-nucleotide cleavage into the downstream duplex can also
be detected, which is similar to that seen for flap substrates
lacking the 30 nt flap (26). In fact, like double flap substrates,
addition of a 30-single nucleotide flap to a nick substrate
resulted in complete loss of detectable di-nucleotide cleavage
products (26). We suggest that EXO activity may be due to
breathing of the terminal base pair such that a single 50 nt flap
enters into the active site for cleavage. Depending on the
stability of the duplex, the terminal nucleotide of the down-
stream duplex may fray and enter the ssDNA binding region
resulting in the second nucleotide entering the active site for
cleavage. In support of this, the duplex arms are kinked rel-
ative to one another (21), and stress due to this conformational
change may facilitate formation of a single nucleotide 50-flap
at a nick site similar to that seen with the 30–50 exonuclease
activity of the Klenow fragment (41). The fact that ExoT13 has
smaller Km value than Nick (Table 2) may also be explained by
this mechanism in that ExoT13 has longer flexible ssDNA
region and can be more easily kinked.
The GEN activity on the fork DNA substrate used here only
differs from the double-flap substrate by the presence of an
additional oligo annealed to the flap portion of the DNA.
We have proposed that DforkT13 binds FEN-1 in a manner
analogous to the flap substrates, and have some evidence to
support this from mutational studies (Figure 5B). Unlike EXO
and duplex gap substrates, we detected a large difference in the
Km of fork gap substrates in comparison with flap substrates,
thereby suggesting that for the most part, the cleavage effici-
ency of DforkT13 is less due to a decreased binding affinity for
this substrate. One reason for this major decrease in binding
affinity could be the loss of a free 50-ssDNA flap. FEN-1 has
been proposed to recognize the free 50 ends of ssDNA on flap
structures and track-down to the cleavage site. If FEN-1 is not
capable of tracking due to the loss of a ssDNA flap, FEN-1
may utilize a less efficient alternative substrate recognition
mode in which dsDNA binding occurs first with the helical
arch subsequently clamping onto the ssDNA region of the fork
gap substrate. Another possibility to explain the decreased
binding affinity is a steric argument in that the dsDNA portion
of the flap strand prevents some portion of the ssDNA from
binding, thereby causing a loss in affinity. This hypothesis is
consistent with our result that GEN activity increases along
with the expansion of gap size (Figure 4). In addition, because
upon DNA binding, the clamp region undergoes conforma-
tional changes, the loss of binding to some portion of the
Figure 8. WRN protein stimulates FEN-1 to cleave hairpin-flap and internal loop substrates. The simulation of FEN-1 activity by WRN protein on hairpin-flap DNA
FB10 and internal loop DNA IL36 was compared with the stimulation on double flap DNA substrate DflapT2. The FEN-1 concentration was 3, 3 and 10 nM for
DflapT2, FB10 and IL36, respectively. Lanes 1, 7 and 13 only has DNA substrates in the reaction. Plus, 100 nM WRN protein. Double plus, 400 nM WRN or BSA.
The reaction buffer for stimulation assay contained 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM NaCl. The bar graph below represents the relative cleavage
fraction for each substrate and is an average of three independent experiments.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 6 1781
ssDNA may also prevent all the necessary conformational
rearrangements for optimal catalysis or affect substrate posi-
tioning, thereby explaining the small change in kcat. Another
possibility for the decrease in observed affinity is that instead
of two dsDNA duplexes for two dsDNA-binding motifs, fork
gap substrates, which have three dsDNA duplexes, may bind
in more than one manner and hence decrease the observable
cleavage. In support of this, we have seen that depending on
the position of the label (i.e. labeling the 50 end of the oligo
annealed to the flap portion), EXO activity can be observed on
the same substrate (data not shown).
The GEN activity on duplex gap substrates is the weakest
activity of FEN-1. Kinetic characterization of duplex gap
cleavage has revealed that the binding affinity of FEN-1 for
this type of substrate is the poorest, while the kcat is compar-
able with the EXO activity and FEN activity on 50-overhang
substrates. Based on our mutational data and by analogy to 50-
overhang and fork gap substrates, we have proposed that
duplex gap substrates bind the helical clamp and H3TH
motif of FEN-1 (Figure 5B). Thus, loss of binding affinity
can be easily explained due to loss of interaction with the
upstream duplex DNA-binding region of FEN-1 similar to
that seen for 50-overhang substrates. In addition, the duplex
on the flap-like portion of the substrate may prevent optimal
binding in a manner similar to that proposed for fork gap
substrates. Furthermore, the decrease in the kcat can be ration-
alized similarly to the 50-overhang substrate in that conforma-
tional rearrangements necessary for optimal catalysis do not
occur due to loss of binding to the upstream duplex DNA-
binding motif.
By comparing the substrate specificity constant kcat/Km
(Table 2), the best substrate for FEN-1 is the double-flap
structure, consistent with the crucial roles of FEN-1 in
Okazaki fragment maturation and lpBER. The fork gap
substrate used here, which to some degree mimics a stalled
replication fork, is not as favored as the flap substrates. The
least favored substrate is duplex-gap DNA, which is proposed
to be the substrate of FEN-1 in apoptotic DNA fragmentation
(18). Considering that high levels of FEN-1 GEN activity
would likely create dsDNA breaks in vivo, it is probably bene-
ficial that this enzyme is an inefficient gap endonuclease.
FEN-1 may require the assistance of other proteins like
WRN (19) or EndoG (18) to facilitate GEN activity on stalled
replication forks and duplex gap substrates, respectively.
The role of the extreme C-terminus of FEN-1 in substrate
binding
We have shown that the C-terminus of FEN-1 likely interacts
with the downstream DNA duplex in vitro. Because the PCNA
interaction site on FEN-1 is a portion of the C-terminus,
whether the C-terminus participates in DNA binding when
bound to PCNA in vivo is questionable. Stucki, et al. reported
that removal of the last 21 amino acids of human FEN-1 did
not affect FEN-1/PCNA binding, but did adversely affect
FEN-1 cleavage assays in the presence of PCNA and
FEN-1/DNAbinding assays, suggesting that even when
PCNA is present, the extreme C-terminus of FEN-1 influences
substrate binding (29). Whether the FEN-1/PCNA and FEN-1
C-terminus/DNA interactions can occur simultaneously
remains to be shown. Recent data from the Cardoso lab
suggest that FEN-1 is only transiently associated with
PCNA at replication foci (42). Therefore, FEN-1 is likely
loaded onto PCNA for flap removal and then dissociates
very rapidly once it has cleaved the flap. The FEN-1/PCNA
co-crystal structure contained three conformational states of
the FEN-1/PCNA interaction. The conformation displaying
the most protein–protein interaction was the inactive state,
in which FEN-1 is likely very distant form the DNA substrate.
The other two conformations of FEN-1, which result from
rotation about a hinge region, showed that FEN-1 was captured
in a conformation that may represent an intermediate to DNA
binding. These conformations, which are likely more similar
to the active form of FEN-1, had less protein–protein contacts
with PCNA, suggesting that FEN-1/substrate binding may
be coupled to the release of the C-terminus from PCNA.
Therefore, the C-terminus may be able to interact with the
downstream duplex DNA in vivo. It should also be noted that
the extreme C-terminus of FEN-1 is acetylated in vitro and
in vivo on lysine residues, and this modification does affect
FEN-1 cleavage and substrate binding in vitro (43). Further-
more, the extreme C-terminus of FEN-1 has been reported to
interact with WRN and BLM (44). Therefore, how these
functions of FEN-1 C-terminus coordinate in vivo needs
further investigation.
The implication of the involvement of FEN-1/WRN in
preventing duplication mutations
Certain sequences can form stable secondary structures
(hairpins or loops) in vivo and inhibit the DNA replication
machinery (45). Since FEN-1 was originally thought to only be
able to bind substrates having free 50-ssDNA ends, FEN-1 was
thought to be unable to remove these structures. Therefore, the
dramatically increased duplication mutation and tri-nucleotide
expansion rate observed in RAD27 null mutant (13,17) were
explained by the greatly increased life-time of flaps in vivo
(35). In this study, we show that FEN-1 alone can weakly
cleave hairpin and internal loop substrates. In addition, the
cleavage of these substrates can be significantly stimulated by
WRN (Figure 8), thereby implicating the FEN-1/WRN com-
plex in the removal of aberrant DNA structures that can form
during Okazaki fragment maturation. Ruggiero and Topal (46)
reported that FEN-1 cannot cleave the hairpin and bubble
structures formed by GAA repeat sequences in vitro. However
the substrates in their assays were only labeled at the 50 end,
which makes the endonuclease cleavage undetectable because
FEN-1’s 50 exonuclease activity removes the radiolabeled
base. We must admit that the GEN activity is indeed much
weaker than the FEN activity in in vitro assays. We suggest
that with the stimulation by other protein partners such as
WRN (Figure 8), the GEN activity of FEN-1 might be relevant
in vivo. In support of this, the non-catalytic WRN C-terminus
(RQC) domain, which is responsible for FEN-1 activity stimu-
lation, has been shown to rescue a temperature-sensitive dna2
mutant in vivo, presumabaly via stimulation of FEN-1 activity
(47). Some evidences also suggest that WRN and FEN-1 are
present in replication foci and recruited to stalled replication
forks (19,48). How WRN stimulates FEN-1 on substrates is
not well understood. However, the RQC domain binds to DNA
(49), and its DNA-binding properties are crucial for stimula-
tion of FEN-1 (50). Therefore, RQC domain may facilitate
1782 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 6
FEN-1 cleavage by loading the GEN substrates onto FEN-1
and/or stabilizing the enzyme/substrate complex. Pre-steady
and steady-state kinetic studies investigating the effect of
this domain on FEN-1 activities should shed light on this
possibility.
The Bloom Syndrome protein (BLM), a RecQ helicase
closely related to WRN, has also been shown to assist
FEN-1 in the resolution of hairpin and internal loop structures
(37). Although BLM can stimulate FEN-1 cleavage on these
substrates in the absence of helicase activity, the helicase
activity of BLM can further increase the cleavage efficiency
of FEN-1. Therefore, Wang and Bambara (37) proposed a
sequential mechanism in which BLM resolves aberrant
DNA secondary structures first with subsequent removal of
the flap by FEN-1. In light of this, the RQC domain and the
helicase domain of WRN may also work together to help
FEN-1 remove aberrant DNA structures formed during
Okazaki fragment maturation, thereby avoiding duplication
mutations and repeat expansions.
