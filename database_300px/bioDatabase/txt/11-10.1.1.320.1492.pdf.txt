ABSTRACT
Although efficient methods exist to assemble syn-
thetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes,
these suffer from the presence of 1–3 random
errors/kb of DNA. Here, we introduce a new method
termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use
to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic
DNA. In this method, errors are revealed as mis-
matches by re-hybridization of the population. The
DNA is fragmented, and mismatched fragments are
removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch
binding protein (MutS). PCR assembly of the remain-
ing fragments yields a new population of full-length
sequences enriched for the consensus sequence
of the input population. We show that two iterations
of consensus shuffling improved a population of syn-
thetic green fluorescent protein (GFPuv ) clones from
60 to .90% fluorescent, and decreased errors 3.5-
to 4.3-fold to final values of 1 error per 3500 bp. In
addition, two iterations of consensus shuffling cor-
rected a population of GFPuv clones where all mem-
bers were non-functional, to a population where 82%
of clones were fluorescent. Consensus shuffling
should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of
long DNA sequences.
INTRODUCTION
Methods for the automated chemical synthesis of oligonucleo-
tides (1,2) and their assembly into long double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) sequences by PCR (3,4) and LCR (5) have enabled
the chemical synthesis of genes and even entire viral genomes
(6,7). These technological advances have helped spur the
formation of the new field of synthetic biology (8), which aims
at defining the functional units of living organisms through the
modular engineering of synthetic organisms. In addition, the
demand for fully synthetic gene length DNA fragments of
defined sequence has dramatically increased in recent years
for use in applications such as codon optimization (9), con-
struction of DNA vaccines (10), de novo synthesis of novel
biopolymers (11), or simply to gain access to known DNA
sequences when original templates are unavailable. The future
demand for long synthetic DNA is likely to dramatically
increase when it becomes cheaper/faster to synthesize a
desired sequence than to obtain it by other means.
The assembly of DNA is currently limited by the presence
of random sequence errors in synthetic oligonucleotides that
arise from side reactions during synthesis (incomplete coup-
lings, misincorporations, etc.) and resulting in 1–3 errors/kb
(7,12,13). The deleterious impact of these errors becomes
more significant as the desired lengths of synthetic DNA
increase. Indeed, in the remarkable assembly of the PhiX
174 bacteriophage genome (5386 bp) using gel-purified, syn-
thetic oligonucleotides, the products contained an average of
2 lethal errors/kb resulting in 1 plaque-forming genomes per
20 000 clones (7). A functional selection (plaque formation)
was required in this study to identify a clone with the correct
sequence. Thus, error reduction/correction is a requirement for
the efficient production of long synthetic DNA of defined
sequence. However, the process of sequencing multiple
clones and manual correction of errors is both costly and
time consuming.
Several methods have been reported for the removal of
error-containing sequences in populations of DNA. These
methods rely upon the selective destruction (14,15) or physical
separation (16,17) of mismatch-containing heteroduplexes.
Smith and Modrich (14) reported the selective destruction
of error-containing sequences in PCR products by generating
dsDNA breaks upon overdigestion with the Escherichia coli
mismatch-specific endonuclease MutHLS (18). Gel purifica-
tion and cloning of the remaining full-length DNA resulted in
an apparent 10-fold reduction in the error rate for PCR pro-
ducts. However, the existing approaches are not well suited for
error removal in long synthetic DNA sequences where virtu-
ally all members in the population contain multiple errors.

Error correction with MutS is outlined in Figure 1. The
population of DNA molecules containing random errors is
first re-hybridized to expose synthesis errors as mismatches
(Figure 1A). Duplexes containing mismatches can then be
removed from the population by affinity capture with immob-
ilized MutS (Figure 1B), a process we term coincidence
filtering, since both strands of the duplex must match to
pass this filtering step. For long synthetic DNA sequences
or for sequences with high error rates, coincidence filtering
is ineffective, since the likelihood of both strands being per-
fectly matched after re-hybridization is very low. To gener-
alize MutS error filtering for application on synthetic DNA,
the synthetic DNA is cleaved into small overlapping fragments
before MutS filtering. Fragments containing mismatches are
selectively removed through absorption to an immobilized
maltose-binding protein (MBP)–Thermus aquaticus (Taq)
MutS–His6 fusion protein (MBP–MutS–H6) (18–20). The
remaining mixture of fragments (enriched with fragments of
the correct sequence) serves as a template for assembly PCR
to produce the full-length product (Figure 1C). This process
can be iterated until the consensus sequence emerges as the
dominant species in the population. This approach is equival-
ent to DNA shuffling (21) with additional mismatch exposure
and removal steps.
In this report, we assemble GFPuv from synthetic oligo-
nucleotides and apply both coincidence filtering and consensus
shuffling protocols to reduce errors in the resultant DNA
populations. The error rates are characterized by gene function
(fluorescence) and by DNA sequencing. We also provide
a mathematical model describing the error reduction proto-
cols to aid predictions about parameters influencing their
effectiveness.

overnight at 4C. MBP–MutS–H6 was eluted using 20 ml
buffer B + 10 mM maltose. Eluate was applied to 4 ml of
Ni-NTA resin pre-equilibrated in buffer B. Bound MBP–
MutS–H6 was washed four times using 20 ml buffer B + 25
mM imidazole. Bound MBP–MutS–H6 was eluted using buf-
fer B + 1 M imidazole. Eluate was concentrated via ultrafiltra-
tion using Amicon Ultra 5 kDa MWCO at 4C. Concentrated
sample was dialyzed extensively against 2· storage buffer
(100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA
and 0.2 mM DTT) using a Slide-A-Lyzer 10 kDa MWCO
cassette at 4C. Protein concentration was determined using
A280 and a calculated extinction coefficient of 119 070 M
1
cm1. Dialyzed sample was diluted using an equal volume of
glycerol and stored at 20C. The final concentration of
MBP–MutS–H6 (M.W. 135, 085) was 19.1 mM for a total
yield of 1.5 mg of protein. Aliquots of sample were taken at
each stage of the purification and resolved on an 8% SDS–
PAGE gel (Supplementary Figure 1).
GFPuv assembly
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen with ‘salt-free’
purification. Sequence 261–1020 of pGFPuv (GenBank
accession no. U62636 with T357C, T811A and C812G base
substitutions) was assembled using 40mer (37) and 20mer (2)
oligonucleotides with 20 bp overlap (Supplementary Table 1).
Assembly reactions contained the following components:
64 nM each oligonucleotide, 200 mM dNTPs, 1 mM MgSO4,
1· buffer and 0.02 U/ml KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase.
Assembly was carried out using 25 cycles of 94C for 30 s,
52C for 30 s and 72C for 2 min. PCR amplification of assem-
bly products contained the following components: 10-fold
dilution of assembly reaction, 25 mM of 20 bp outside primers,
200 mM dNTPs, 1 mM MgSO4, 1· buffer and 0.02 U/ml KOD
Hot Start DNA Polymerase. PCR was carried out using
35 cycles of 94C for 30 s, 55C for 30 s and 72C for 1 min
followed by a final extension at 72C for 10 min. PCR products
were purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit
with elution in dH2O followed by speed-vac concentration.
Assuming an error rate of 1 · 106/bp/duplication for KOD
DNA polymerase (24), 35 cycles of PCR would be expected to
introduce 0.053 mutations per assembled GFPuv molecule.
Mismatch exposure and GFPuv fragmentation
Assembled GFPuv was diluted to 250 ng/ml in 10 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl and heated to 95C for 5 min
followed by cooling 0.1C/s to 25C. Heteroduplex for con-
sensus filtering was split into three pools and digested to com-
pletion with NlaIII (NEB), TaqI (NEB) or NcoI plus XhoI
(Promega) for 2 h following the manufacturer’s protocols.
Digests were purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR puri-
fication kit with elution in dH2O. Samples were pooled and the
concentration was determined by measuring A260.
MBP–MutS–H6 binding
MBP–MutS–H6 binding reactions contained 11.5 ng/ml
DNA and 950 nM MBP–MutS–H6 dimers in 1· binding
buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM DTT and 5% glycerol). Reactions were allowed
to incubate at room temperature for 10 min before incubation
for 30 min with an equal volume of amylose resin
pre-equilibrated in 1· binding buffer. Protein–DNA com-
plexes were removed by low-speed centrifugation and aliquots
of supernatant were removed for subsequent processing.
Reassembly, amplification and cloning
Supernatant (50 ml) from consensus filtering experiments
was desalted using Centri-Sep spin columns (Princeton
Separations) and concentrated. Purified and concentrated
DNA fragments were reassembled as above with aliquots
removed at varying cycles. Aliquots of assembly reactions
were resolved on 2% agarose gels to monitor the reassembly
process. Aliquots showing predominantly reassembled full-
length GFPuv were PCR amplified as above. Aliquots
of supernatant from coincidence filtering experiments were
diluted 10-fold and PCR amplified as above. PCR products
were digested with BamHI/EcoRI and ligated into the 2595 bp
BamHI–EcoRI fragment of pGFPuv. Ligations were trans-
formed into E.coli DH5 and fluorescent colonies were scored
using a handheld 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) lamp.
Preparation of substrate for consensus shuffling
from 10 non-fluorescent GFPuv clones
Ten non-fluorescent GFPuv clones were pooled in equal
amounts. The nature and location of the mutations in these
clones is shown in Figure 4. The GFP coding region was PCR
amplified from the mixture and submitted to the consensus
shuffling protocol with and without the application of the
MBP–MutS–H6 error filter.
RESULTS
To create an error filter, we constructed a fusion protein
between MBP (19) and the mismatch binding protein from
T.aquaticus (22) with a C-terminal His6 tag (MBP–MutS–H6).
MBP–MutS–H6 was overexpressed and purified from E.coli
to >95% purity (Supplementary Figure 1). MBP–MutS–H6
immobilized on amylose resin was shown to selectively retain
a 40mer heteroduplex containing a deletion mutation over
wild-type homoduplex (Supplementary Figure 2).
To demonstrate error correction, unpurified 40mer oligo-
nucleotides were assembled by PCR (3) to produce a 760 bp
gene encoding green fluorescent protein (25) (GFPuv). Two
independent preparations of GFPuv containing typical gene
synthesis errors (Figure 3 and Table 1) were re-hybridized
and subjected to two iterations of coincidence filtering or con-
sensus shuffling. For consensus shuffling, the GFPuv assembly
product was split into three pools and digested into sets of
overlapping fragments using distinct Type II restriction
enzymes (Figure 2). The digests were pooled and subjected
to error filtering with or without added MBP–MutS–H6. The
unbound fragments were reassembled into full-length products
and PCR amplified. For coincidence filtering, unbound full-
length GFPuv was PCR amplified following treatment with
the error filter. After cloning in E.coli, error rates were estim-
ated by scoring colonies for fluorescence under a handheld UV
lamp (Figure 3). The actual error rates of the input and con-
sensus shuffled populations were determined by sequencing
plasmid DNA from randomly selected colonies (Figure 3). The
results show that two rounds of consensus shuffling increased
the percentage of fluorescent colonies from 60 to >90% and

reduced the error rate of the populations 4.3- and 3.5-fold from
values of 1.3 to 0.3 and 0.98 to 0.28 errors/kb, respectively.
MBP–MutS–H6 was required to increase the fraction of fluor-
escent colonies in each round of error filtering. The nature of
the errors in the input and consensus shuffled populations are
reported in Table 1.
Although DNA shuffling has traditionally been used to cre-
ate diversity through the combinatorial shuffling of mutations
in a population, DNA shuffling also creates a sub-population
of sequences with a reduction in diversity, as correct fragments
can recombine to produce error-free sequences. Indeed, with
consensus shuffling, it is possible to start with a population of
DNA molecules wherein every individual in the population
contains errors and create a new population where the dom-
inant sequence is error free. To demonstrate this, 10 non-
fluorescent GFPuv clones, each containing a deletion mutation
(Figure 4), were pooled and subjected to either DNA shuffling
alone or two iterations of consensus shuffling. Products were
cloned in E.coli, and the percentage of fluorescent colonies was
monitored as an indication of progress toward the consensus
sequence. DNA shuffling alone (no MBP–MutS–H6) increased
the percentage of fluorescent colonies to 30% (387 colonies
total) similar to a previous report (26). Two rounds of consensus
shuffling gave a new population that was 82% fluorescent
(551 colonies total), indicating that the dominant species
was likely the consensus sequence of the input population.
DISCUSSION
Both consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering protocols
were effective in reducing errors in synthetic GFPuv popula-
tions (Figure 3). In both cases, two iterations of either
consensus shuffling or coincidence filtering increased fluores-
cent colonies from average values of 60 to >90%. Seq-
uencing data from two independent experiments showed a
4.3- and 3.5-fold reduction in the error rate for the consensus
shuffled populations compared with the input populations
giving final error rates of 0.3 and 0.28 errors/kb, respect-
ively. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the
MBP–MutS–H6 error filter in both consensus shuffling and
coincidence filtering protocols. Taq MutS has previously been
shown to bind to deletion mutations with high affinity (27),
a mutation common in synthetic DNA. However, it is import-
ant to note that Taq MutS has lower affinity for specific point
mutations and binds weakly to homoduplex DNA (27). These
factors may limit the stepwise efficiency of the error filter.
Moreover, specific point mutations may be refractory
to removal even after multiple rounds of consensus shuffling.
Two rounds of consensus shuffling using the MBP–MutS–H6
error filter proved most effective in reducing deletions and G/C
to A/T transitions, consistent with previous reports for the
selectivity of Taq MutS (27). However, it must be emphasized
that each synthetic oligonucleotide point mutation would
generate two heteroduplex DNA molecules containing unique
mismatches after PCR amplification and re-hybridization
(Figure 1A and Table 1). For example, a G to A transition
mutation in a synthetic oligonucleotide would generate het-
eroduplexes with G–T or A–C mismatches after PCR ampli-
fication and re-hybridization. For consensus shuffling, either
of these mismatch containing heteroduplexes could evade
precipitation by the MBP–MutS–H6 error filter and participate
in the reassembly of full-length GFPuv. Therefore, Table 1
lists the pair of mismatches that could give rise to the observed
transition or transversion mutation. These results show that the
MBP–MutS–H6 error filter was most effective at removing
insertion/deletion loops and G–T/A–C mismatches from the
population.
It should be possible to generalize the consensus shuffling
protocol to a large number of synthetic DNA constructs. GFPuv
was chosen as the synthetic construct in this study for its
advantages as a fluorescent reporter gene. This allowed easy
optimization of our protocol without the need to sequence
thousands of base pairs of DNA. We expect the results reported
here for consensus shuffling to readily translate to synthetic
DNA constructs of varied sequence, greater overall length and/
or higher initial errors/kb. Synthetic DNA constructs of varied
sequence can be digested into a defined set of fragments using
Type II restriction enzymes or fragmented into any desired size
range using controlled DNase I digestion (26). Digestion and
reassembly of a large number of different genes is expected to
be as robust as the protocol of DNA shuffling (28), which has
been broadly applied to a variety of gene sequences. Synthetic
DNA constructs larger than GFPuv are expected to be amen-
able to error correction by consensus shuffling, as the error
filtering is conducted on gene fragments before reassembly
of the full-length gene. Thus, the errors/kb data presented in
this study are expected to translate to larger genes with similar
initial errors/kb (excepting mutations introduced by PCR amp-
lification following the final application of the error filter).
Synthetic DNA constructs of higher initial errors/kb are expec-
ted to be amenable for error correction by consensus shuffling.
However, these constructs will require digestion into smaller
sized gene fragments that may affect the efficiency of error
correction. In contrast to consensus shuffling, an increase in the
size of the synthetic DNA product or an increase in errors/kb
would preclude the use of the coincidence filtering protocol,
as every molecule in the population would contain one or more
errors. As proof of the utility of the consensus shuffling
Figure 4. Locations of mutations in the 10 non-fluorescent clones used as input for a consensus shuffling experiment. The number designation for each clone is
followed by the type of mutation (D = 1 base deletion; X:X point mutations = GFPuv sense strand wt nucleotide:nucleotide substitution for wt nucleotide) and its
position in assembled GFPuv. All 10 clones contain a single deletion mutation at distributed positions throughout the GFPuv open reading frame with 3/10 containing
an additional point mutation. The generation of a GFPuv sequence encoding a fluorescent product is expected to coincide with the correction of all 10 deletion
mutations. Therefore, percent fluorescent colonies are an indication of progress toward the consensus sequence of the population. The numbering system used is that
of pGFPuv (GenBank accession no. U62636). Assembled GFPuv begins at position 261 and ends at position 1020.

protocol, 10 non-fluorescent GFPuv clones containing one or
more errors (Figure 4) were converted into a population where
82% of the clones were fluorescent. It is important to note that
DNA shuffling alone shows an improvement in percent fluor-
escent colonies in this example (from 0 to 30%). For synthetic
DNA populations, DNA shuffling alone shows no improvement
in percent fluorescent colonies (see Figure 3 ‘no MutS’ treat-
ments). DNA shuffling alone improves the overall number of
correct sequences only for small DNA populations with low
error rates. For example, when shuffling 10 clones with a
unique mutation in each clone, one would expect the fraction
of correct products to be (9/10)10 = 35% (26), very close to the
value of 30% that we observed. A mathematical model describ-
ing the error rates for shuffling and error filtering of synthetic
DNA populations is presented below.
To estimate some parameters of consensus shuffling
and coincidence filtering, a simple mathematical model
(Equations 1–6) was constructed. An input population of
dsDNA molecules of length N, containing E errors/base is
re-hybridized, fragmented into shorter dsDNA fragments of
average length S, error filtered and reassembled. P(F) is the
probability a fragment of length S will have a correct sequence.
We determine the probability that re-hybridized duplexes
will have zero (C), one (H ) or both (I ) strands with errors.
Equation 5 estimates the probability that a fragment will be
correct after a cycle of MutS filtering, P(F0), by applying a
MutS selectivity factor (M ) to adjust the relative amounts of
mismatch containing duplexes (I, H ) while accounting for the
total fraction of correct strands in the re-hybridized duplexes.
The probability of obtaining an error free assembly product,
P(A), is then given by Equation 6.

From our consensus shuffling error rate data (Figure 3), we
estimate the MutS selectivity factor M to be 2.2. Figure 5
shows some predictions that emerge from this model assuming

(1.8 errors/kb). Consensus shuffling is predicted to be most
effective with smaller fragment sizes (Figure 5A). As men-
tioned above, smaller fragment sizes could be obtained by
controlled digestion with DNase I (21). In addition, multiple
iterations of MutS filtering can have dramatic results on popu-
lations with few correct sequences (Figure 5B), although the
model does not account for the differing specificity of MutS
toward the various types of mismatches. The model also pre-
dicts that even modest improvements in the MutS selectivity
factor through optimization of the MutS–DNA binding con-
ditions and/or the use of a combination of MutS homologs with
varying mismatch specificity (29) could dramatically improve
the consensus shuffling protocol (Figure 5C). Coincidence
filtering (N = S) is predicted to be effective for populations
with low error rates per clone (Figure 5D) but becomes inef-
fective when the majority of re-hybridized duplexes contain
mismatches.
We have demonstrated consensus shuffling and coincidence
filtering as experimental methods to significantly reduce errors
in synthetic DNA. Consensus shuffling should be generally
applicable for error correction on synthetic genes of typical
lengths and error rates. Two iterations of consensus shuffling
(6 h/iteration) generated a population with 1 error/3500 bp.
This reduction in error rate will allow the identification of a
correct clone after sequencing DNA from a reduced number of
colonies. Coincidence filtering is a simple and effective pro-
cedure to reduce errors in synthetic DNA populations with low
error rates per clone. These methods should significantly
increase the speed and decrease the cost of production of
synthetic genes.
Note: While this manuscript was under review, Carr et al.
(30) independently reported the application of Taq MutS in
protocols for error reduction on synthetic DNA.
