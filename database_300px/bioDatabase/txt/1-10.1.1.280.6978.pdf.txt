ABSTRACT
We have synthesized triple helix forming oligo-
nucleotides (TFOs) that target a psoralen (pso) inter-
strand crosslink to a specific chromosomal site in
mammalian cells. Mutagenesis of the targeted cross-
links results in base substitutions and deletions.
Identification of the gene products involved in muta-
tion formation is important for developing practical
applications of pso-TFOs, and may be informative
about the metabolism of other interstrand crosslinks.
We have studied mutagenesis of a pso-TFO genomic
crosslink in repair proficient and deficient cells.
Deficiencies in non homologous end joining and mis-
match repair do not influence mutation patterns. In
contrast, the frequency of base substitutions is
dependent on the activity of ERCC1/XPF and poly-
merase z, but independent of other nucleotide exci-
sion repair (NER) or transcription coupled repair
(TCR) genes. In NER/TCR deficient cells the frequency
of deletions rises, indicating that in wild-type cells
NER/TCR functions divert pso-TFO crosslinks from
processes that result in deletions. We conclude that
targeted pso-TFO crosslinks can enter genetically
distinct mutational routes that resolve to base substi-
tutions or deletions.
INTRODUCTION
Triple helix forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) (1) have been
under development for many years as gene targeting reagents
(2–4). Triplexes form most readily on intact duplexes contain-
ing uninterrupted polypurine:polypyrimidine elements. They
are stabilized, in sequence-specific fashion, by hydrogen
bonds between the bases of the third strand and purine strand
of the duplex. Third strands may be composed of either purines
or pyrimidines, depending on the nature of the target sequence.
One goal of triplex research is bioactive TFOs that could bind
specific chromosomal sequences in living cells, and provoke
events that yield a desired outcome, such as gene knockout by
mutagenesis, targeted recombination/gene conversion, etc.
With certain purine motif third strands, it appears that the
triplex structure is sufficiently distorting to provoke a response
by cellular repair functions resulting in detectable mutagenesis
of the target site (5,6). However, linkage of TFOs to a DNA
reactive compound, such as the interstrand crosslinking agent
psoralen (7,8), results in much higher mutation frequencies
(9,10). We have described pyrimidine motif pso-TFOs, with
modified sugar residues, that have strong biological activity in
living cells as measured in an assay of gene knockout at a
specific chromosomal site (11,12). These TFOs did not have
any inherent mutagenic activity, and the targeted mutagenesis
was dependent on photoactivation of the psoralen. Pso-TFOs
can be viewed as dual component reagents, (oligonucleotide
and psoralen) and further development and exploitation will
require an understanding of both components. Thus, in addi-
tion to continued studies on the chemistry and activity of
TFOs, it is also important to understand the factors that influ-
ence the ultimate fate of the target sequence crosslinked by the
pso-TFO. In turn, the information gained from these studies
might reveal new insights into the processing of crosslinks
formed by well characterized compounds such as psoralens,
Mitomycin C, nitrogen mustards, etc.
Early studies in Escherichia coli on the repair of crosslinks
concluded that incision, by the NER apparatus, of one strand
on either side of the crosslink, produced a gapped, ‘unhooked’,
substrate with the excised fragment still attached to the non-
incised strand by the crosslinking agent. The gap is repaired
by homologous recombinational repair mediated (HRR) by
recA, using information from an undamaged homologous

chromosome (13–17). The ‘other side’ of the crosslink can
then be repaired by conventional NER. In the absence of
recombination, the gap may be filled by lesion bypass by
polB polymerase (18,19). These studies define the essentials
of a major crosslink repair pathway-recognition followed by
incision and gap formation (unhooking), then gap repair by
recombination or lesion bypass synthesis.
In yeast multiple pathways for crosslink metabolism have
been defined, engaging NER, error prone polymerases, recom-
binational functions and post replication lesion avoidance (20–
22). In mammalian cells the situation is also complex and there
are many unresolved questions. Based on biochemical studies,
it is widely accepted that the ERCC1/XPF complex (23,24) is
essential for ‘unhooking’ crosslinks (25,26), although this has
not been shown directly in vivo. However, experiments
employing the alkaline comet assay demonstrate that incision
of genomic DNA in cells following exposure to crosslinking
agents is markedly reduced in cells deficient in ERCC1/XPF
(27,28). Attention has also been called to the activity of this
complex at replication forks stalled or broken at crosslinks
(27–32). While cells with deficiencies in ERCC1 or XPF are
quite sensitive to crosslinking agents, cells with defects in
other NER genes are only moderately sensitive, suggesting
that conventional NER does not make an essential contribution
to crosslink repair (27,33,34). However, the literature on the
role of NER is contradictory, with different conclusions
reached in different experimental systems. For example, repair
synthesis on crosslinked plasmids in cell extracts was depen-
dent on ERCC1 and XPF, but not other NER genes (35).
Similarly, incision in cells treated with crosslinking agents
was unaffected by NER deficiency other than ERCC1/XPF
(27,28).
In contrast, a dependence on NER genes other than ERCC1/
XPF was demonstrated in another plasmid system (36). Tran-
scription coupled repair (TCR) was also implicated (37), con-
sistent with an earlier report (38). Psoralen crosslink repair was
defective in CHO cells deficient in the XPD helicase (39). It
has also been proposed that the NER apparatus introduces gaps
on one side of a crosslink without actually unhooking the
crosslinked strands, leading to a ‘futile cycle’ of incision
and gap filling (40,41).
Although most recent work has addressed aspects of cross-
link repair such as incision or resolution of stalled or broken
replication forks, there have been a few studies of sequence
alterations induced by crosslinking agents. Psoralen induced
base substitutions were recovered in the HPRT gene (42,43)
presumably due to error prone lesion bypass during gap filling
across templates still carrying the unhooked crosslink and
associated oligonucleotide. It has been proposed that poly-
merase h contributes to this process (37,44), while the role
of other lesion bypass polymerases has yet to be established.
Unrepaired crosslinks can provoke the formation of breaks in
one of the daughter arms at a replication fork, resulting in
chromosome rearrangements (32). Deletions and insertions
are also recovered although how these occur is not understood
(45,46). The relationship between different repair pathways
and different sequence alterations for chromosomal crosslinks
has not been established.
In the experiments reported here we have determined the
mutational consequences of targeted crosslinks in cells with
different repair deficiencies. We show that the frequency of
base substitutions reflects the activities of the ERCC1/XPF
complex and pol z. NER/TCR functions are involved in
crosslink metabolism, although they are not necessary for
the formation of base substitutions. The generation of dele-
tions is independent for all NER/TCR activity, including
ERCC1/XPF.
METHODS
Cell lines
The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) wild-type cell lines AA8
and V79, and various CHO repair deficient cell lines (UV5/
XPD, UV41/XPF, UV24/XPB, UV61/CSB, XR-V15B/Ku86)
were obtained from Dr Larry Thompson (Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory) and grown in a-MEM supplemented with peni-
cillin, streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mis-
match repair deficient D35 and the parental CHO-pro3- cell
lines were obtained from Dr Lawrence Chasin (47,48). ERCC1
deficient (knockout) CHO727 cells (49) were transfected with
an expression vector containing hamster ERCC1 cDNA under
the control of a CMV promoter and stable integrants were
selected by growth in medium containing 200 mg/ml
hygromycin B (Invitrogen) to generate ERCC1 complemented
cell lines. XR-V15B (Ku86 deficient) cells were obtained from
the ATCC. The 9N human fibroblasts and the 6I derivative
expressing antisense message against the REV3 subunit of pol
z have been described (50,51). The Artemis deficient fibroblast
cell line (52) was the kind gift of Dr Jean Pierre Villartay.
Werner Syndrome skin fibroblasts supplemented with the tert
gene were obtained from Dr J. Shay (53).
Triplex forming oligonucleotides and
HPRT deletion assay
The 17 nt triplex forming oligonucleotide, AE-07, against the
hamster hprt target, and the 16 nt human version were syn-
thesized and purified as described previously (54). Prior to
experiments, cells were cultured in medium containing
HAT (104 M hypoxanthine, 5 · 106 M aminopterin,
105 M thymidine) to remove pre-existing HPRT-deficient
cells. Chinese hamster cells were synchronized in G0/G1 by
a variation of the method described by Sawai et al. (55,56).
Briefly, cells were plated at subconfluent levels and the next
day the medium changed to DMEM with 2% FBS and 2%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After 48 h the cells were washed
with (85–88% G0/G1 cells by FACS analysis) and either elec-
troporated or fed with complete medium (for G1 phase experi-
ments), or incubated with complete medium containing 100
mM mimosine for 16 h to block them in early S phase (90%
early S phase cells) (57). After 16 h the cells were released
from the mimosine block by feeding with DMEM/10% FBS.
Pso-TFOs were introduced by electroporation using an Amaxa
nucleoporator. Conditions were developed for each cell line
such that transfection efficiencies were on the order of 60–
80%, as monitored by expression of GFP following electro-
poration with a GFP encoding plasmid. Transfection was
followed by incubation and exposure in the Rayonet chamber
to UVA light for 3 min at 1.8 J/cm2. The cells were passaged
twice over an 8 day period and then plated in culture medium
containing 20 mM 6-thioguanine (6-TG). Cells were also
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17 5383
plated in medium without 6-TG to determine plating effici-
ency. After 7–10 days, colonies were counted and the deletion
frequencies calculated as the ratio of 6-TG resistant colonies/
total colony forming cells. The relationship between dose of
TFO and the frequency of 6-TG resistant colonies is given in
the Supplementary Data.
Small pool PCR
TFO treated cells were harvested at the time of 6-TG selection
at which time the cells had undergone 8–10 population
doublings. Crosslinks cannot persist in proliferating cells,
and so the targeted crosslinks would be cleared from the
cell population by the time of harvest. DNA was extracted
and PCR performed on 50 pg aliquots of DNA (five diploid
genome equivalents). Typical reactions contained 50 pg DNA,
0.2mM primers (E5Fb: CTAGTTTGAGGCCAGCTTTGGC;
E5Rb: GGGATTCCAGGCATGCCTTACTG), 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP and 0.5 U Taq polymerase in a final
volume of 20 ml. A total of 10 ml aliquots of the 750 bp PCR
product were digested completely with XbaI in 0.5· NEB
buffer 2 containing BSA in a total volume of 30 ml, elec-
trophoresed on a 2.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium
bromide staining. Fragments with mutations were identified by
resistance to cleavage by XbaI. A nested PCR amplification
was performed on 1 ml of the XbaI digested small pool PCR
products diluted 1/100–1/1000 using previously published
Exon 5 PCR primers (E5R: GGCTTACCTATAGTATACAC-
TAAGCTG; E5F: AACATATGGGTCAAATATTCTTTC-
TAATAG). The resultant PCR products were digested with
XbaI to check for resistance to cleavage and sequenced using
the Sequitherm cycle sequencing kit (Epicentre) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions using the forward PCR reac-
tions primer as the sequencing primer. Base substitution
frequencies were calculated as the number of mutations
detected over the total number of successful PCR multiplied
by five (since each reaction consisted of five genome equiva-
lents). Typical analyses were based on 960 or, in some cases,
1440 genome equivalents. The validation of this approach is
given in the Supplementary Data.
Characterization of deletions
Colonies from 6-TG selected plates were picked and grown up
on 96-well plates in medium containing 6-TG. DNA was
extracted and the Exon 5 region amplified and the PCR
products were sequenced.
Determination of ICL induced incision by
alkaline comet assay
The comet assay is based on the differences in electrophoretic
mobility of supercoiled and relaxed (by breaks) loops of
genomic DNA from single cells. The DNA in relaxed loops
migrates in an electrophoretic field forming a tail relative to
the ‘head’ of non-migrating unbroken DNA. DNA from cells
treated with crosslinking agents failed to migrate but incision
of the crosslinked genomic DNA during repair restores the
comet tail (28,58). Cells treated with 8-methoxypsoralen
(8-MOP) and irradiated with UVA were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped immediately
or 6 h after the UVA treatment, and suspended in PBS.
Approximately 1.5 · 104 cells were mixed with 1.5%
low-melting-point agarose, and spread on a microscope
slide that had been pre-coated with 1% agarose. A total of
100 ml of low-melting-point agarose was applied on top of the
sample layer as the last step of slide preparation. Slides were
placed in cold lysis buffer for at least 1h at 4C (2.5 M NaCl,
100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100 and 10%
DMSO), followed by rinsing three times in PBS for 5 min.
After lysis, slides were incubated in DMSO free lysis solution
containing 1 mg/ml of proteinase K for 2 h at 37C. Slides
were washed in PBS three times before incubation in cold
unwinding solution [300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA (pH
13)] in the dark at 4C for 45 min. Electrophoresis was carried
out under the same condition at 25 V for 45 min. Slides were
then rinsed in neutralizing solution [0.4 M Tris (pH 7.5)] three
times for 5 min and fixed in 100% ethanol before staining with
ethidium bromide. Images of 50–100 cells per sample were
obtained by using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 M,
Carl Zeiss) and Axiovision 4.2 software. Individual comet
images were evaluated by using Komet 5 image software.
The relative tail intensity was used as a measure of DNA
ICL damage. The removal of ICL was analyzed by comparing
the tail intensity of the UVA irradiated 8-MOP treated cells
with that of the UVA irradiated control cells.
RESULTS
hprt target sequence
The CHO hprt triplex target sequence is next to the splice
acceptor sequence adjacent to Exon 5 (Figure 1). At the end of
the sequence is a TA step which is a preferred site for psoralen
crosslinking. The crosslink is between the T at the end of the
triplex target (proximal T) and the T on the complementary
strand one base removed (distal T). The site also includes the
recognition sequence for the XbaI restriction enzyme. The
schematic of the pso-TFO, AE-07, described previously
(12), is shown. This TFO has 4 clustered 20-O-(2-aminoethyl)-
ribose (20-AE) residues, which are important for bioactivity
(11,12), with the remainder 20-O-methylribose (20-OMe)
(Figure 1). The corresponding human target has the same
sequence except for a run of 5 Ts instead of the 6 Ts in the
hamster.
Sequence alterations are similar in wild-type, MMR and
NHEJ deficient cells
We have determined the frequency and character of deletions
and base substitutions in cells with several DNA repair defi-
ciencies. These were chosen because prior studies argued for a
direct role of the relevant genes in crosslink repair, or because
they might be expected to influence the processing of inter-
mediates formed during pso-TFO crosslink metabolism. For
example, based on experiments in cell free extracts it has been
suggested that MutSb (the heterodimer of MSH2-MSH3) is
involved in crosslink recognition (59). We found a slight dif-
ference (reproducible, but not statistically significant) between
wild-type and MutSb deficient hamster cells in their deletion
frequencies (Figure 2a), but no difference in base substitution
frequencies (Figure 2b). We repeated the analysis in the
human MMR deficient lines HHUAchr2 (MSH3) and
HHUAchr5 (MSH6), and found similar results with both
5384 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17
(data not shown). The base substitutions in all the lines were
largely T->C transitions as well as some T->A transversions,
and were located at the enlarged T in the target sequence as
shown in Figure 1 (proximal T). These data do not contradict a
role for MMR in the recognition of pso-TFO crosslinks, but
they do indicate MMR is not a major influence on the muta-
genesis of targeted genomic crosslinks.
We performed the experiments in cells deficient in two
components of the NHEJ pathway, Artemis (52) and Ku86,
found wild-type deletion and base substitution frequencies,
and the standard pattern of base substitutions (data not
shown). The protein defective in Werner Syndrome (WS)
interacts with the Ku proteins (60), and cells derived
from patients with WS have been shown to have a mild
sensitivity to crosslinking agents (61). However, the frequen-
cies and patterns of base substitutions and deletions in cells
derived from a WS patient were similar to wild-type (data not
shown).
Role of ERCC1/XPF
Previous studies indicated that the pso-TFO targeted deletions
were consistent with the processing of double-strand breaks
(45,54). A dependence on ERCC1/XPF in the formation of
double-strand breaks at crosslinks has been reported (59).
Rothfuss and Grompe concluded that efficient DSB formation
during ICL repair was dependent on preceding ERCC1-
dependent incision events (28). However, DSB formation,
independent of ERCC1/XPF, has been linked to breakage
of replication forks stalled at crosslinks (27,32). We treated
wild-type AA8, CHO727 (ERCC1 deficient) and UV41 (XPF
deficient) cells with the pso-TFO in mid S phase and found that
the frequency of deletions was much greater in the CHO727
Figure 1. Schematic of the CHO hprt target sequence. The psoralen crosslink site, 50 TA, lies between the triplex target sequence and the start of Exon 5 (lower case
letters). The crosslink site is also included in an XbaI recognition site. The human target sequence differs from the hamster in that there is a run of 5 rather than 6 Ts.
The AE-07 pso-TFO contains a patch of four 20-AE substitutions at the 30 end, and 20OMe residues in the remainder of the molecule. The structures of the 20-AE and
20-OMe ribose nucleosides are shown.

and UV41 cells than in the wild-type cells (Figure 3a). We
considered the possibility that these deletions might be differ-
ent from those generated in wild-type cells, since they were
derived from a pathway necessarily independent of ERCC1/
XPF. We analyzed the sequence of 26 deletions from UV41
cells from cells treated in mid S phase. The deletion size
ranged from a few nucleotides to 40. We found that 85%
were bounded by microhomologies of 1–4 nt (Figure 3b).
These results were similar to those obtained with wild-type
cells (54,56).
The hprt gene replicates early in S phase (62,63). It has been
proposed that crosslinks provoke double-strand breaks as a
result of collision with replication forks (30,32,64). Thus, in
cells treated in mid S phase there would be many hours before
a pso-TFO crosslink would have the opportunity to block a
fork in the hprt gene. During that time other repair pathways
might be operative, and the frequency and kinds of events
might differ from those arising from fork encounters. In
order to consider this possibility we treated AA8 and
CHO727 cells in late G1 phase with the pso-TFO. We
found that the frequency of deletions in the CHO727 cells
treated in late G1 phase was the same as that from the S
phase experiments. Furthermore, the size distribution was
similar.
In contrast to the rise in deletions, there was a dramatic
decline in the frequency of base substitutions in the XPF
and ERCC1 deficient cells, with a complete loss of these
events in the CHO727 cells (Figure 3c). To verify the require-
ment for the ERCC1/XPF complex for base substitutions we
complemented the CHO727 cells by transfection with wild-
type hamster ERCC1 cDNA. Stable clones were isolated and
shown to be as resistant to psoralen and MMC as wild-type
cells. Treatment of the complemented cells with the pso-TFO
yielded targeted base substitution and deletion frequencies
similar to those in wild-type cells (data not shown).
These results demonstrated that the ERCC1/XPF complex
was necessary for the base substitutions. However, the forma-
tion of deletions was independent of the activity of the com-
plex, and the absence of the complex did not influence their
properties.
Lesion bypass polymerases and base substitution
mutagenesis of pso-TFO crosslinks
Base substitutions at sites of DNA damage are a result of
lesion bypass by specialized error prone polymerases (65).
Polymerase h has been implicated in this process for cross-
links, based on a plasmid assay (37). We asked if the frequency

or pattern of base substitutions would be influenced by a
deficiency in polymerase h. The Xeroderma pigmentosum
variant cells (polymerase h-null) were not amenable to colony
forming assays, and so a measurement of deletion frequency
was not possible. However, we were able to recover and
characterize base substitutions, and these proved to be ident-
ical to those recovered from wild-type human cells, T!C and
T!A at the proximal T.
We then examined the targeted mutagenesis in cells engi-
neered by cDNA antisense expression to be deficient in poly-
merase z (50,51). Survival assays with these cells and the
parental counterparts demonstrated no enhanced sensitivity
to psoralen (data not shown). The analysis showed no effect
on deletion frequency by pol z suppression (Figure 4a). How-
ever we saw a 3-fold decline in base substitution frequency
(Figure 4b). Sequence analysis indicated a shift in the nature
and location of base substitutions, as compared to the wild-
type control (Figure 4c). Those from the control cells were
located exclusively at the site of the proximal T in Figure 1.
Only a few were recovered from the pol z antisense cells.
These were located at positions outside the crosslink site,
as well as at the proximal T. The results contrasted with
the wild-type control and with the compilation of 341 events,
derived from experiments with cell lines that showed the

wild-type base substitution pattern (Figure 4d). Those patterns
were dominated by T to C and, to a lesser extent, T to A, at
the site of the proximal T. A few substitutions (4/341) in the
compilation were located outside the crosslink site. These
were similar to those in the pattern from the pol z antisense
cells, although they were proportionately much less common.
The simplest interpretation of these results was that the poly-
merase z was required for base substitutions at the crosslinked
proximal T, while other polymerases introduced mutations
at the sites away from the targeted crosslink. The two events
at the wild-type site in the spectrum from the antisense cells
most likely reflected the incomplete suppression of pol z in
those cells.
Role of NER and TCR in incision of crosslinked
genomic DNA in G1 cells
As discussed above, the role of NER/TCR functions in cross-
link repair in mammalian cells is unresolved. It has been
argued that replication forks blocked or broken by crosslinks
would present a substrate to the ERCC1/XPF complex (32).
In proliferating cells the activity of ERCC1/XPF at crosslink
stalled forks could obscure contributions by the larger ensem-
ble of NER/TCR activities, which might function independent
of replication (22). Thus it was important to ask if components
of NER/TCR were involved in the metabolism of crosslinked
genomic DNA, in the absence of replication. To address this
question we chose an assay that could report a cellular res-
ponse to treatment with a crosslinking agent in a phase of the
cell cycle and time frame that would preclude replication. We
treated wild-type and XPD deficient cells with psoralen/UVA
in early G1 phase, and then measured the introduction of DNA
breaks into genomic DNA by comet assay. We found that the
tail intensity had nearly recovered to control levels after 6 hr in
the wild-type cells, before entry into S phase, in good agree-
ment with a recent report (28). However, in XPD deficient
cells there was essentially no recovery in this time (Figure 5a
and b). Transcription coupled repair of psoralen crosslinks was
demonstrated by Hanawalt et al. (38) and is consistent with the
strand asymmetry of mutations described by several groups
(37,42,43,66) and our own data (56). The experiment was
repeated in CSB deficient UV61 cells in G1 phase. The results

were quite similar to those obtained with the XPD deficient
cells-relative to the 0 time sample there was little recovery in
the 6 h after treatment (Figure 5b). Thus it appeared that NER/
TCR functions played a role in the response to treatment with
the crosslinking agent.
Mutagenesis of pso-TFO crosslinks in
NER and TCR deficient cells
In the light of these results and the pronounced effect of
ERCC1/XPF deficiency shown in Figure 3 we were curious
to examine the effect of NER/TCR deficiency on the mutation
pattern. Treatment of the XPD deficient cells with the pso-
TFO resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in deletions relative to
wild-type cells (Figure 6a) with no change in the frequency
of base substitutions (Figure 6b). Similar results were obtained
with XPB deficient CHO UV24 cells (data not shown). We
found that the frequency of deletions was elevated 5-fold in
CSB deficient UV61 cells, while the base substitution fre-
quency was unchanged (Figure 6a and b). Sequence analysis
showed that the pronounced strand asymmetry of base substi-
tutions was the same as in wild-type cells, indicating that the
CSB function was not critical to the strand asymmetry.
These data in these two series of experiments indicated that
NER/TCR functions were involved in the processing of DNA
crosslinked by both psoralen and the pso-TFO. They demon-
strated that in wild-type cells NER/TCR activities were unnec-
essary for entry into pathways that resulted in base
substitutions, but drew targeted crosslinks away from path-
ways that resulted in deletions.
DISCUSSION
Targeted DNA damage by TFO conjugates
Previous studies on the metabolism of site specific chromo-
somal damage have been limited to double-strand breaks
introduced by rare site restriction endonucleases (67).
TFOs, under development for many years (2), have been con-
jugated to a variety of DNA damaging agents. These TFO
conjugates would appear to offer an approach to covalent
modification of specific chromosomal sites in mammalian
cells. However TFOs with genomic targeting activity have
become available only recently. We have described a pattern
of 20-AE substitution (68) in TFOs that confers bioactivity
(11,12), and have used these modified TFOs to place a pso-
ralen crosslink at a defined genomic site in living cells (12,56).
The experiments described here are the first analysis of some
of the genetic factors involved in the metabolism of targeted
DNA damage.
NER-triplex interactions
Based on experiments with plasmids and cell extracts it has
been suggested that a triplex linked to a psoralen crosslink can
be an inhibitor of NER mediated incision activity (69,70), or a
target of repair activities (5). It is not technically possible at
this time to compare the metabolism of the targeted psoralen-
TFO crosslink with an unconjugated psoralen crosslink at the
same chromosomal target site. However it should be noted that
the sequence alterations described in this report required pso-
ralen photoactivation. Thus they were dependent on psoralen
crosslink formation, rather than on attack by cellular functions
on the triplex structure itself. This is probably the consequence
of our use of an RNA analogue pyrimidine TFO, which
imposes very little distortion on the underlying duplex (71),
in contrast to the greater deformation that results from the
formation of non isomorphous triplets by the deoxy purine
TFOs (2) employed in earlier studies (6,9). Furthermore, if
the TFO used in our experiments were a potent inhibitor of
NER, we would have expected to see little difference in results
between wild-type cells and NER deficient cells. As indicated
in Figure 6, however, there are clear quantitative differences
between wild-type and NER deficient cells, implying that
NER must contribute to the processing of the chromosomal
pso-TFO crosslink in wild-type cells.

Base substitution mutagenesis of pso-TFO crosslinks
Recent work in yeast (20–22) identifies multiple pathways
available for crosslink metabolism, some of which are likely
to be operative in mammalian cells and applicable to the pso-
TFO crosslinks. From the perspective of this report, those
pathways that proceed through intermediates generated by
the activity of ERCC1/XPF on the targeted crosslink would
have some probability of terminating in base substitutions. An
increase in the activity of the ERCC1/XPF incision complex
(drawing more lesions into the pathway) and/or increased
levels of polymerase z would result in enhanced base substi-
tutions. It is likely that there is more than one entry into this
pathway, perhaps dependent on cell cycle status (22) (see
Figure 7).
The results with CSB deficient cells are consistent with a
role for CSB in processing the pso-TFO crosslink, perhaps
through its association with RNA polymerase II and function
in TCR. However CSB has several additional activities,
including chromatin remodeling and DNA wrapping (72),
and could influence pso-TFO crosslink metabolism via a
mechanism independent of TCR. Our data are in accord
with a role for TCR/NER genes in the processing of the
pso-TFO crosslinks, although it should be noted that the struc-
ture(s) of intermediates generated by these activities is/are not
known. At the same time our results also indicate that these
functions (other than ERCC1/XPF) are not essential for the
formation of base substitutions. Deficiencies in XPD, XPB and
CSB had no effect on base substitution frequencies. This con-
clusion contrasts with that from studies of error prone repair of
psoralen crosslinks in a transcribed gene in a non-replicating
plasmid. Repair, which was accompanied by base substitu-
tions, was reduced when the reporter plasmid was transfected
into NER deficient cells (36). A resolution of this apparent
contradiction would be that in proliferating cells deficiencies
in NER/TCR would be compensated for by the eventual
encounter of a crosslink with a replication fork. There is an
origin of replication near the transcriptional promoter of the
HPRT gene (73), and the replication fork and transcription
bubbles would move through the gene in the same direction.
This would explain the same mutational strand bias observed
in both wild-type and TCR deficient cells in our experiments.
Deletion events
The deletions in all of our experiments are typical of those
resulting from resolution of a double-strand break by NHEJ.
An invariant property of all the deletions is the loss of the
nucleotides engaged in the pso-TFO crosslink. A key inter-
mediate would be a target region with double-strand breaks
on both sides of the crosslink. Our experiments indicate
quite clearly that deletion formation can occur in the absence
of NER/TCR functions, including ERCC1/XPF. Thus,
models which invoke successive rounds of incision by the
Figure 7. Schematic of mutation pathways for pso-TFO crosslinks. The pso-TFO crosslinks enter an ERCC1/XPF dependent base substitution pathway as a result of a
block to duplex unwinding incurred during transcription, replication, etc. An intermediate may also be formed in the absence of replication through the action of NER/
CSB, although this is speculative. Base substitutions are introduced during translesion synthesis by pol z. Translesion synthesis could be by error free polymerase(s)
without mutation. Error free recombination pathways may also resolve the intermediates generated by ERCC1/XPF. Deletion formation is not dependent on NER/
TCR/ or ERCC1/XPF and but does require cleavage of strands on either side of the crosslink (heavy arrows). These may arise in duplex DNA (A) or at a blocked
replication fork through a series of breakage and cleavage reactions (B) or as a result of the collision of two replication forks on either side of the crosslink, followed by
breakage of one arm of each fork (C). Unresolved crosslinks, or unrepaired ends may be the precursors for large rearrangements.
5390 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 17
ERCC1/XPF or the NER apparatus on either side of the pso-
TFO crosslink cannot explain our results. Indeed, in wild-type
cells these activities draw crosslinks away from entry into
pathways that result in deletions. There are multiple, specu-
lative, routes to deletion formation at the pso-TFO crosslink.
One would derive from a series of cleavage events on either
side of the crosslink in intact duplex DNA, likely involving
more than one activity (Figure 7A). A replication fork, broken
on one side of the crosslink, could be a precursor to the dele-
tions, but only if there were additional cleavage events on the
other side of the crosslink in the unreplicated DNA
(Figure 7B). Otherwise there would be no partner for the
end joining reaction [see (74) for a detailed discussion of
the repair of broken replication forks]. Another possibility
would be the collision of two replication forks, traveling
towards each other, with the crosslink (Figure 7C). Breakage
of one arm of each fork would release two broken ends that
could be joined by NHEJ or similar pathway. In the two rep-
lication models unjoined ends would be candidates for large
scale rearrangements or broken chromosomes which might be
lost if cells carrying them failed to survive expansion of the
culture before selection. Double-strand breaks enhance the
frequency of recombination, and an understanding of their
generation and repair will have implications for protocols
for pso-TFO targeted gene conversion and recombination.
