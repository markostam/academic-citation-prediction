ABSTRACT
It was described earlier that the Drosophila GAGA
factor [Trithorax-like (Trl)] interacts with dSAP18,
which, in mammals, was reported to be a component
of the Sin3–HDAC co-repressor complex. GAGA–
dSAP18 interaction was proposed to contribute to
the functional regulation of the bithorax complex
(BX-C). Here, we show that mutant alleles of Trl,
dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1 enhance A6-to-A5 trans-
formation indicating a contribution to the regulation
of Abd-B expression at A6. In A6, expression of Abd-B
is driven by the iab-6 enhancer, which is insulated
from iab-7 by the Fab-7 element. Here, we report
that GAGA, dSAP18 and dRPD3/HDAC1 co-localize
to ectopic Fab-7 sites in polytene chromosomes
and that mutant Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1 alleles
affect Fab-7-dependent silencing. Consistent with
these findings, chromatin immunoprecipitation ana-
lysis shows that, in Drosophila embryos, the endo-
genous Fab-7 element is hypoacetylated at histones
H3 and H4. These results indicate a contribution of
GAGA, dSAP18 and dRPD3/HDAC1 to the regulation
of Fab-7 function.
INTRODUCTION
The GAGA protein of Drosophila is a sequence-specific
DNA-binding protein that plays essential roles during devel-
opment (1–3). In particular, GAGA, which is encoded by the
Trithorax-like (Trl) gene (4), contributes to the maintenance of
homeotic gene expression and to silencing. Mutant Trl alleles
show posterior-to-anterior transformations indicating a loss of
Ubx and Abd-B function (4). GAGA was also found to bind
in vitro and in vivo to several polycomb-response-elements
(PREs) of the bithorax complex (BX-C), and to be required for
their silencing activity (5–12). In this context, GAGA was
found to co-immunoprecipitate with components of the poly-
comb repressive complex 1 (7,13), suggesting a contribution to
its recruitment.
GAGA was also shown to interact with dSAP18 (14), a poly-
peptide that, in mammals, associates with the Sin3–HDAC
co-repressor complex (15). The GAGA–dSAP18 interaction
was proposed to contribute to the regulation of BX-C (14) as,
in polytene chromosomes, GAGA and dSAP18 co-localize
at BX-C and deficiencies uncovering dsap18 enhance the
homeotic A6-to-A5 transformation associated with some Trl
mutations. In this study, the contribution of dSAP18 to the
regulation of Abd-B expression is confirmed through the ana-
lysis of mutant dsap18 alleles. Moreover, mutations in drpd3/
hdac1 were also found to enhance A6-to-A5 transformation.
Expression of Abd-B in A6 is under the control of the iab-6
enhancer that is insulated from the iab-7 enhancer by the
Fab-7 element. Fab-7 contains two functionally independent
elements: a PRE, responsible for polycomb-dependent silen-
cing of the iab-7 enhancer, and a boundary element located
50 of the PRE (6,16). Here, we show that GAGA, dSAP18
and dRPD3/HDAC1 co-localize to ectopic Fab-7 elements
and that mutant alleles of these genes affect silencing imposed
by Fab-7. These results indicate that GAGA, dSAP18 and
dRPD3/HDAC1 contribute to the regulation of Fab-7 function.

insertion in the 50-untranslated region (50-UTR) of dsap18, and
Df(3R)sbd45, which uncovers dsap18 (19), were obtained from
the Bloomington Stock Center. The transgenic GCD6 and
5F24(25,2) lines are described previously (20,21). dsap1818
(this study) and dsap18117 (22) were generated as imprecise
excisions from EP(3)3462 by P-element mobilization.
dsap1818 carries 5.4 kb of the original P-element insertion
and shows no alteration of the dsap18 open reading frame
(ORF) (data not shown). dsap18117 corresponds to a deficiency
of 341 bp of the 50 region of the dsap18 ORF and carries 1.7
kb of the original P-element insertion (22). dsap18117 is a null
dsap18 allele as judged by northern and western analyses of
dsap18117/Df(3R)sbd45 flies (data not shown). dsap18R718
stock was obtained from the original dsap18117 line by meiotic
recombination (22). All three dsap18 mutations used here are
lethal in homozygous or trans-heterozygous. For the rescue
experiment, a transgenic line was generated carrying a pCaS-
peR vector containing 4 kb of the 50 region of the dsap18
ORF and the coding sequence of dsap18 fused to a HA-tag.
Details of the construct are available upon request. The
transgene was mapped onto chromosome X. Expression of
dSAP18-HA protein was characterized by western and
immunofluorescence analyses (data not shown) using an
a-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche).
Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunostaining of polytene chromosomes with rat aGAGA
(1:50), rabbit adSAP18 (1:20) and rabbit adRPD3 (1:100) was
performed according to the method of James et al. (23). For
in situ hybridization the 3.6 kb long Fab-7 element was labeled
with fluorescein and used as a probe. Images were recorded in
a computer-controlled Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence micro-
scope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics).
The fluorescent signals, recorded separately as gray-scale
digital images, were pseudocoloured and were merged using
Adobe Photoshop.
Analysis of the effects on silencing
To analyze the effects of different mutations on Fab-7-
dependent silencing of the mini-white gene in GCD6 flies,
all stocks were crossed to a w background. GCD6 flies homo-
zygous for the Fab-7-transgene were crossed with flies het-
erozygous for the indicated mutations and the eye phenotype
of the progeny carrying the mutations compared with their
wild-type siblings.
To analyze the effects on pairing-sensitive silencing of the
sd gene, homozygous 5F24(25,2) fly stocks carrying the
different mutations to be analyzed were generated by conven-
tional crosses.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
Drosophila embryos 0–18 h old were dechorionated and resus-
pended in ENB buffer [10% sucrose, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH
8.0, 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF)]. Embryos were transferred to a 15 ml dounce homo-
genizer, disrupted with 20 strokes and filtered. Nuclei were
pelleted at 2300 g for 5 min at 4C, and resuspended in buffer I
(15 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA and
1 mM DTT). Cross-linking was carried out with 1% formal-
dehyde in buffer I for 30 min at 4C. To stop the cross-linking
reaction glycine was added to 0.125 M. After centrifugation,
nuclei were resuspended in buffer I and sonicated in a Branson
sonifier set at 30% output, 10 s for three times. The sonicate
was spun at 14 000 g for 15 min at 4C. For immunoprecip-
itation assays the extract was diluted 1/10 with IP buffer
(1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM PMSF, 2 mg/ml aprotinin and
1 mg/ml leupeptin). Preclearing was performed by adding
2 mg single-stranded salmon sperm DNA, 1 mg preimmune
serum and 30 ml of equilibrated Protein A beads (Protein A–
Sepharose CL-4B; Amersham Biosciences) in IP buffer and
samples were rotated for 1 h at 4C. Beads were removed
by centrifugation and the appropriate antibody (2 mg of
anti-acetyl-Histone H3 ref. 06-599 upstate and 2 ml anti-
acetyl-Histone H4 ref. 06-866 upstate) was added and incub-
ated overnight at 4C with gentle mixing. Immunocomplexes
were purified by adding 2 mg single-stranded salmon sperm
DNA and 50 ml of equilibrated Protein A beads and were
incubated for 3 h at 4C. Beads were recovered by centrifu-
gation for 2 min at 3000 g and washed sequentially with TSE I
buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl), TSE II buffer (1%
Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 8.0 and 500 mM NaCl), buffer III (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40,
1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 8.0) and twice with TE. Samples were extracted for three
times with 100 ml of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M
NaHCO3) and were incubated for 6 h at 65
C to reverse form-
aldehyde cross-links. DNA was purified by GFX PCR Kit
(Amersham Biosciences) and was resuspended in 50 ml. Input
samples were obtained using 10% of the sonicated chromatin
solution used for immunoprecipitation reactions. PCRs were
performed by standard procedures with 2 ml of undiluted sam-
ples and 1/5 and 1/25 dilutions. The following primer pairs
were used: boundary, 50-TTGCGGTGGTGTGCGTGC-30 and
50-TCAAGCTGTGTGGCGGGG-30; PRE, 50-GTCGGCAAT-
TCGGATTCCC-30 and 50-TTCGGTCGCTCACGTCGC-30;
Fab7-X, 50-GTAGGTGCAAAAGGCGATG-30 and 50-TCAA-
TCCACACGCACTGCC-30; Trl, 50-AGTGGGCAGTGATG-
GAGCAG-30 and 50-ATGATTGAAGGCTCGGCTGG-30;
and Sap18, 50-GTGCGATAGGATTGCTGC-30 and 50-GTT-
GGGGTACACGACAGC-30. The amplified DNA was separ-
ated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by using ethidium
bromide. Quantification of the results was carried out by deter-
mining for each genomic region the fold-enrichment obtained
after immunoprecipitation with respect to the background
precipitation obtained in the absence of any added antibody.
Relative enrichment was determined by normalizing the fold-
enrichment obtained for each genomic region for that corres-
ponding to the dsap18 promoter region. Results are the
average of three independent experiments.
RESULTS
Mutations in Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1 enhance
A6-to-A5 transformation
It was shown elsewhere (4) that males homozygous for the
hypomorphic Trl13C allele contain bristles on the sixth sternite,
which in the wild-type is devoid of any bristles, indicating
that cells of A6 have acquired an A5 identity. This homeotic

transformation results from a partial loss of Abd-B function at
A6 and, therefore, indicates a contribution of GAGA to the
regulation of Abd-B. This transformation is enhanced in flies
heterozygous for the null Trl67 allele and hemizygous for a
deficiency uncovering dsap18 (14). Approximately 60% of
Trl67/Df(3R)sbd45 males showed A6-to-A5 transformation,
as judged by the presence of at least one bristle at the sixth
sternite (Table 1, effect of Trl genotype). This transformation
is infrequent in Trl67/+ (6%) or Df(3R)sbd45/+ (18%) males.
Similar results were obtained with other mutant Trl alleles
(data not shown). This genetic interaction might reflect a
contribution of dSAP18 to the regulation of Abd-B expression.
Confirming this hypothesis, a null dsap18117 mutation (22)
shows a strong A6-to-A5 transformation with 80% of
dsap18117/Df(3R)sbd45 males containing at least one bristle
in the sixth sternite (Table 1, effect of dsap18 genotype).
Similar results were obtained with dsap18R718, a stock
derived from sap18117, where recessive background mutations
were removed by meiotic recombination (22) (Table 1, effect
of dsap18 genotype). Other dsap18 mutations, such as
EP(3R)3462 and dsap1818, show a significantly weaker trans-
formation (Table 1, effect of dsap18 genotype). The trans-
formation observed in dsap18117/Df(3R)sbd45 flies is
significantly rescued by a transgene expressing dSAP18
under the control of its own promoter, as the number of
males containing at least one bristle in the sixth sternite is
reduced from 80%, in the absence of the transgene, to 50%, in
flies carrying the transgene in the heterozygous condition.
Moreover, the intensity of the transformation is strongly
reduced as the frequency of flies showing >2 bristles highly
diminishes in the presence of the transgene (from 34 to 4%)
(Table 1, effect of dsap18 genotype). Altogether, these results
demonstrate the contribution of dsap18 to the regulation of A6
identity.
In mammals, SAP18 was found to be associated with the
Sin3–HDAC co-repressor complex (15). Therefore, we
analyzed whether mutations in drpd3/hdac1 also enhance
the A6-to-A5 transformation. Three different mutant alleles
were analyzed: deficiency HDAC1def24, a null mutation in
which most of the 50-UTR region into the second exon is
deleted, and two specific missense mutations, HDAC1303
and HDAC1313, each carrying single amino acid substitutions
in highly conserved protein regions (18). As shown in Table 1
(effect of drpd3/hdac1 genotype) all three mutants show
intense A6-to-A5 transformation in trans-heterozygous to
Df(3R)sbd45, as shown by the high frequency of flies contain-
ing >2 bristles in the sixth sternite, with some individuals
having up to 10 bristles. These results indicate that similar
to dSAP18, dRPD3/HDAC1 also participates in the regulation
of Abd-B expression at A6 and are consistent with the asso-
ciation of dSAP18 with the Sin3–HDAC complex.
The homeotic A6-to-A5 transformation observed in Trl67/
Df(3R)sbd45 or HDAC1def24/Df(3R)sbd45 flies cannot be attrib-
uted only to a loss of dsap18 function since no transformation
is detected in Trl67/dsap18117 (Table 1, effect of dsap18 geno-
type) or HDAC1def24/dsap18117 flies (data not shown), indic-
ating that additional elements contained within the genomic
region uncovered by Df(3R)sbd45 are also contributing to the
observed effects. In particular, Df(3R)sbd45 uncovers taranis,
an essential trithorax gene (17), which could contribute to the
observed homeotic transformation. Null taranis alleles, as
taraL4, are lethal in trans-heterozygous to Df(3R)sbd45.
However, no significant homeotic transformation is observed
in flies trans-heterozygous for taraL4 and Trl67, dsap18117,
HDACdef24 or HDAC313 (data not shown), indicating that the
homeotic transformation described above is not due only to a
loss of taranis function either.
GAGA, dSAP18 and dRPD3/HDAC1 co-localize at
ectopic Fab-7 copies
At A6, the expression of Abd-B is regulated by the iab-6
enhancer. Therefore, the homeotic transformation observed
in the mutant conditions described above could reflect their
contribution to the activation of iab-6. It is also possible that
GAGA, dSAP18 and dRPD3/HDAC1 are required for the
function of the Fab-7 element, so that in their absence, iab-
6 is not insulated efficiently from the negative regulators that
maintain silencing of iab-7 in A6.
To test this hypothesis, we performed immunolocalization
experiments to determine whether GAGA, dSAP18 and
dRPD3/HDAC1 were present at the Fab-7 element. For
these experiments, we used the transgenic GCD-6 line,
which carries, at position 61C9, a transgene containing two
copies of the Fab-7 element flanking a UAS-lacZ construct
upstream of a mini-white gene (20). As shown in Figure 1A, in
polytene chromosomes from GCD-6 flies, a strong aGAGA
signal is observed at position 61C9 (indicated by the arrow),
which overlaps with the in situ signal corresponding to the
transgene, and is not detected in wild-type ORE-R flies. This
additional aGAGA signal is located close to a significantly
less intense endogenous aGAGA band that is observed both in

wild-type and GCD-6 chromosomes (indicated by an asterisk
in Figure 1).
As shown in Figure 1B, dSAP18 also localizes to the
position of the transgene in GCD-6 chromosomes. A sharp
adSAP18 signal is detected at position 61C9 overlapping with
the additional aGAGA signal that marks the position of the
transgene but not with the endogenous aGAGA signal men-
tioned above. This adSAP18 signal is not present in ORE-R
chromosomes. Localization of GAGA and dSAP18 to the
transgene is associated with the presence of the Fab-7 element
in the construct since no recruitment is observed in a control
transgenic U/15 1,1 line that, at position 93B, carries a trans-
gene similar to that in GCD-6, but missing the two Fab-7
elements (20). The immunolocalization patterns of GAGA
and dSAP18 at region 93B show no significant differences
in polytene chromosomes from U/15 1,1 flies compared
with ORE-R (Figure 1C). Recruitment of dRPD3/HDAC1
to the transgene was also tested (Figure 1D). In this case,
the analysis was more difficult due to the large number of
adRPD3/HDAC1 bands detected at position 61C9. Actually,
as described by others (24), the global immunolocalization
pattern of dRPD3/HDAC1 in polytene chromosomes is much
more complex than the patterns of GAGA and dSAP18.
Nevertheless, in GCD-6 chromosomes, a faint adRPD3/
HDAC1 band could be detected that co-localizes with the
additional aGAGA band associated with the presence of
the transgene and which does not appear to be present in
ORE-R chromosomes.

(20,21,25,26). In the transgenic GCD-6 line, the expression of
the mini-white gene is silenced in cis by Fab-7 so that strong
silencing is observed in flies carrying the transgene in a het-
erozygous state. Heterozygous GCD-6 flies show strongly
patterned variegated eyes with a red triangle in a pale yellow
background (Figure 2, +/+). Silencing imposed by Fab-7 is
known to depend on PcG (20,21). Consistent with these obser-
vations, in heterozygous GCD-6 flies, the mutant Pc3 allele
relieves silencing of the mini-white gene (data not shown). In
contrast, cis-silencing by Fab-7 is enhanced in GCD-6 flies
heterozygous for the Trl13C mutation (20). A similar enhance-
ment is observed in the presence of other mutant Trl alleles,
such as Trl67 (data not shown). Here, the effects of mutations
in dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1 on Fab-7-dependent cis-silencing
were also analyzed. In heterozygous GCD-6 flies, Fab-7-silen-
cing is enhanced by the presence of the mutant dsap18117
allele, where the red triangle characteristic of the eye pheno-
type of GCD6 flies is hardly detectable (Figure 2). Similarly,
drpd3/hdac1 mutations, such as hdacdef24 and hdac313, also
enhance Fab-7-dependent cis-silencing (Figure 2).
Fab-7 is also known to mediate silencing in trans, so that, in
some transgenic lines, Fab-7-mediated silencing is pairing-
sensitive being observed only when the transgene is in a homo-
zygous state (6,21,26). In the GCD-6 line described above,
silencing of the mini-white gene is not pairing-sensitive; het-
erozygous flies show strong silencing and a higher expression
is observed in the homozygous condition. On the contrary, a
different transgenic line, the 5F24(25,2), that carries a similar
transgene as GCD-6 but missing one of the two Fab-7 ele-
ments, shows strong silencing only in the homozygous con-
dition (26). In the 5F24(25,2) line, two copies of the transgene
are inserted in tandem, at position 13F on the X-chromosome,
9.6 kb upstream from the scalloped (sd) gene that is involved
in wing development (27). It was shown earlier that, in the
5F24(25,2) line, the Fab-7 insertion silences sd expression in a
pairing-dependent manner (26). Reduced expression of the sd
gene causes characteristic wing defects, from small lesions
in the margin to complete destruction of the wing blade. As
shown previously (26), homozygous 5F24(25,2) females
manifest a strong sd phenotype with a high penetrance;
destruction of the two wings is observed in 72% of the indi-
viduals and 16% showed destruction of at least one wing
(Table 2). Heterozygous females or hemizygous males showed
no sd phenotype at all (data not shown) (26). The sd phenotype
of homozygous 5F24(25,2) females is strongly suppressed
in trans-heterozygous dsap18117/Df(3R)sbd45 flies (Table 2),
with only 4% of the individuals showing destruction of both
wings. Significant suppression is also observed in heterozyg-
ous dsap18117 flies (Table 2), which showed destruction of
both wings only in 36% of the individuals. Mutations in Trl
and drpd3/hdac1 showed similar effects (Table 2). In the
presence of the HDACdef24 mutation a similar suppression
of the sd phenotype is detected with only 30% of the flies
showing destruction of the two wings (Table 2). On the other
hand suppression by the Trl67 mutation was slightly weaker
with destruction of both wings observed in up to 51% of the
females (Table 2). A similar suppression of Fab-7-dependent
pairing-sensitive silencing was reported earlier in the presence
of a different Trl13C mutant allele (6,10).
Histones at the endogenous Fab-7 element of BX-C are
hypoacetylated
The results reported above indicate a contribution of
drpd3/hdac1 to the regulation of Fab-7 function suggesting
that chromatin at the endogenous Fab-7 element of BX-C is
likely to be hypoacetylated. Indeed, as judged by ChIP-
analysis, both the PRE and the boundary elements of Fab-7
are significantly hypoacetylated (Figure 3). In these experi-
ments, cross-linked chromatin from Drosophila embryos was
subjected to immunoprecipitation with a-acetylH3 antibodies,
recognizing histone H3 acetylated at residues K9 and K14,
and with a-acetylH4 antibodies, recognizing histone H4

the boundary regions of Fab-7 are poorly represented in the
immunoprecipitated material when compared with the dsap18
promoter region (Figure 3B, columns PRE and boundary).
In contrast, a proximal Fab-7 region located 1 kb from the
boundary shows a higher relative enrichment (Figure 3B, col-
umns Fab7-X) similar to that observed for the Trl coding
region (Figure 3B, columns Trl). These results indicate
that, in Drosophila embryos, the endogenous Fab-7 of BX-
C is hypoacetylated at the boundary and PRE regions. It was
reported earlier that, in cultured S2 cells, the Fab-7 PRE is
methylated at histone H3 (28,29), which is in agreement with
our results as deacetylation is a pre-requisite for histone
methylation.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have shown results indicating that GAGA, dSAP18
and dRPD3/HDAC1 contribute to the function of the Fab-7
element of BX-C. This conclusion is based on the following
observations:
(i) the localization of GAGA, dSAP18 and dRPD3/HDAC1 at
ectopic Fab-7 elements.
(ii) the effects of Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1 mutations on
Fab-7-dependent silencing. Ectopic Fab-7 constructs are
known to mediate silencing of flanking reporter genes
(20,21,25,26) both in cis, as in heterozygous GCD6 flies
(20,21), as well as in trans, as in 5F24(25,2) flies (26),
where silencing is pairing-sensitive being observed only
when the transgene is in a homozygous state (26). Here,
we have shown that Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1 muta-
tions affect both cis- and trans-silencing mediated by
Fab-7.
(iii) the homeotic A6-to-A5 transformation observed in flies
heterozygous for various Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1
mutant alleles and hemizygous for Df(3R)sbd45, which
uncovers dsap18. This homeotic transformation results
from the ectopic repression of the iab-6 enhancer at A6
that is insulated from the repressed iab-7 enhancer by the
Fab-7 element. The fact that this homeotic transformation
is very infrequent in hemizygous Df(3R)sbd45 flies, as well
as in the heterozygous mutants, demonstrates that it is
directly associated to the Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1
mutations. Moreover, a single copy of a transgene expres-
sing dsap18 significantly rescues this phenotype. Our
results also indicate that an unidentified element(s)
contained within Df(3R)sbd45 is also contributing to the
establishment of the phenotype. In addition to sap18,
Df(3R)sbd45 uncovers at least 11 other genes includ-
ing the trithorax gene, taranis (17). However, the
homeotic transformation described here does not appear
to be associated to a loss of taranis function as no trans-
formation is observed in flies trans-heterozygous for a
null taranis allele and Trl, dsap18 or drpd3/hdac1
mutations.
Together, these results indicate a contribution of GAGA,
dSAP18 and dRPD3/HDAC1 to the structural and functional
properties of Fab-7. What could this contribution be? Several
models might account for our results. Fab-7 is known to
contain two functional elements: a PRE, which is required
for Pc-dependent silencing, and an adjacent boundary element
that insulates iab-6 from iab-7 (6,16). The finding that, in
heterozygous GCD6 flies, mutant Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/
hdac1 alleles enhance cis-silencing imposed by Fab-7 sug-
gests that their functions might antagonize Pc-dependent silen-
cing. Several observations, however, make this hypothesis
unlikely. First, at some PREs, GAGA helps recruitment of
PcG complexes and contributes to silencing (7,8). Second,
dRPD3/HDAC1 was shown to be a component of several

precipitation from 10% of the material used for the immunoprecipitation. (B) Quantification of the results shown in (A). Relative enrichment with respect to the

PcG complexes (13,30), and genetic analysis indicates a
contribution to homeotic silencing (31). Finally, in mammals,
SAP18 acts as a repressor when targeted to an active
promoter (15).
An alternative possibility is that GAGA, dSAP18 and
dRPD3/HDAC1 contribute to the function of the Fab-7 bound-
ary element. In fact, the Fab-7 boundary contains several
GAGA-binding sites that are required for its enhancer block-
ing activity (32) and, as shown here, it is hypoacetylated at
histones H3 and H4. In GCD-6 flies, the Fab-7 boundary
element is located proximal to the reporter mini-white gene
with respect to the PRE (20) so that it might help to insulate the
reporter gene from repression by the PRE. In this context,
mutations that affect boundary function would result in
a less efficient insulation and, therefore, would enhance
silencing.
In contrast to the enhancer effect observed in heterozygous
GCD6 flies, mutations in Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1 sup-
press pairing-dependent trans-silencing in 5F24(25,2) flies.
A contribution to boundary-functions might also account
for this effect. Pairing-sensitive trans-silencing results from
long-distance chromosomal interactions that involve the
association of the transgenes with each other and with the
endogenous Fab-7 element, even when located in different
chromosomes (26). These long-distance interactions that
require the contribution of PcG proteins might be facilitated
by a functional boundary element as was described previously
for the gypsy insulator (33,34).
The incomplete A6-to-A5 homeotic transformation
observed in the presence of Trl, dsap18 and drpd3/hdac1
mutations might also reflect a contribution to the boundary
function of Fab-7 as, in the mutant conditions, it might not
properly insulate the iab-6 enhancer from the repressing activ-
ity of the Fab-7 PRE, thereby becoming partially inactivated.
Interestingly, mutations that delete the Fab-7 boundary but not
the PRE produce, in addition to strong A6-to-A7 transforma-
tion, incomplete A6-to-A5 transformation (16). Moreover,
replacement of the Fab-7 boundary by the gypsy or the scs
insulator, which are not functional in the context of BX-C,
results in complete A6-to-A5 transformation (35).
Our results indicate that GAGA, dSAP18 and dRPD3/
HDAC1 have similar effects on the functional properties of
Fab-7 suggesting a functional link. A physical interaction
between GAGA and dSAP18 was reported earlier (14). More-
over, in mammals, SAP18 was found to be associated with the
Sin3–HDAC co-repressor complex (15) and, in Drosophila,
dSAP18 modulates bicoid activity through the recruitment of
dRPD3/HDAC1 (19) and it is required to suppress bicoid
activity in the anterior tip of the embryo (22). In this context,
it is tempting to speculate that GAGA helps in the recruitment
of dSAP18 and dRPD3/HDAC1 to Fab-7 resulting in a con-
certed contribution to its boundary function.
In mammals, SAP18 was also found to be associated with
ASAP, a protein complex involved in RNA processing (36).
In Drosophila, dSAP18 could also participate in RNA pro-
cessing as, in cultured S2 cells, a large proportion of dSAP18
co-immunoprecipitates with factors that participate in RNA
processing (M.L. Espina´s et al., unpublished data). It is
possible that, in response to cellular signals, the association
of dSAP18 to different protein complexes would be regulated
during development and/or cell cycle progression.
