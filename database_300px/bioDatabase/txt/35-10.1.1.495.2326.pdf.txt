ABSTRACT
The occurrences of two recurrent motifs in ribosomal
RNA sequences, the Kink-turn and the C-loop, are
examined in crystal structures and systematically
compared with sequence alignments of rRNAs from
the three kingdoms of life in order to identify the range
of the structural and sequence variations. Isostericity
Matricesareusedtoanalyzestructurally thesequence
variations of the characteristic non-Watson–Crick
base pairs for each motif. We show that Isostericity
Matrices for non-Watson–Crick base pairs provide
important tools for deriving the sequence signatures
of recurrent motifs, for scoring and refining sequence
alignments, and for determining whether motifs are
conserved throughout evolution. The systematic
use of Isostericity Matrices identifies the positions
of the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides
relative to the structurally characterized examples of
motifs and, most importantly, specifies whether these
changes result in new motifs. Thus, comparative ana-
lysis coupled with Isostericity Matrices allows one to
produce and refine structural sequence alignments.
The analysis, based on both sequence and structure,
permits therefore the evaluation of the conservation
of motifs across phylogeny and the derivation of rules
of equivalence between structural motifs. The conser-
vations observed in Isostericity Matrices form a pre-
dictive basis for identifying motifs in sequences.
INTRODUCTION
Folded RNA molecules exhibit complex architectures in which
a large fraction of the bases engage in non-Watson–Crick
(non-WC) base pairs and form motifs that mediate long-
range RNA–RNA interactions and create binding sites for
proteins and small molecule ligands. For homologous RNA
molecules, the architectures are highly conserved, more than
the underlying secondary structures, as different secondary
structures can produce basically similar three-dimensional
(3D) folds (1,2). Because of the prevalence and central
roles of non-WC base pairs in RNA tertiary interactions,
we have sought in previous works to extend the isostericity
concept to include them so as to develop rules for identifying
base substitutions in RNA sequences that conserve the 3D
structures of motifs (3,4). Moreover, elucidating these substi-
tution rules is the key for refining and eventually automatizing
sequence alignment, and is crucial for deeper understanding of
the coupling between RNA evolution and RNA architecture.
Our aim is to derive sets of evolutionary and structural rules
for constructing pertinent architectures for RNA molecules on
the basis of an analysis of sequences. Ultimately, the derived
sets of rules should help predict RNA folds from sequences
alone. Thus, the aim of the present analysis is not to classify
RNA motifs or to search for motifs in folded X-ray structures
of RNA (5,6). We wish to relate a previously identified RNA
motif to the sets of constraints between nucleotides which
allow the formation of the motif. The starting point is first
crystal structures and, then, an alignment of RNA sequences
functionally homologous to the one crystallized. Therefore,
the present analysis cannot offer explanations for the kinetics
of folding or its underlying physico-chemical requirements
(e.g. presence of magnesium ions, protein cofactors or
small ligands), since it assumes the final folded state. Experi-
mental and theoretical studies have emphasized the dynamical
flexibility and the magnesium or protein requirements of
K-turns (7–10). Furthermore, while motifs with recurrent con-
formers of the sugar-phosphate backbone but without apparent
sequence conservation are very useful to our understanding
(5,6), they cannot at this stage be used for predicting RNA

structure from sequence alone and are, thus, not considered
here. It is clear that an RNA motif is the result of a combina-
tion of base–base interactions and of backbone preferences; for
example, the double helix has defined backbone preferences
(11) but its identification from sequences alone relies on base–
base WC covariations. Likewise, our present analysis aims at
deriving the covariation rules for more complex RNA motifs
with non-WC base pairs.
We define RNA motifs as ordered arrays of non-WC base
pairs under constraints, which may be interspersed with bulged
out or inserted bases. Motifs are often embedded within regu-
lar helical regions forming internal loops, but may also com-
prise hairpin or junction loops. The concept of isostericity
provides the basis for extracting the constraints acting on
RNA motifs. These constraints can then be applied (i) for
structure-based alignment of homologous sequences; (ii) for
analyzing and classifying RNA motifs; and (iii) for the pre-
diction of 3D structure based on sequence variation in
homologous RNA molecules. In the present contribution,
we develop and apply Isostericity Matrix analysis to determine
sequence signatures for recurrent Kink-turn and C-loop motifs
and to evaluate their conservation at corresponding homolog-
ous positions in families of ribosomal RNA molecules. We
show that this process simultaneously leads to a realignment of
homologous sequences. Therefore, Isostericity Matrices are
not only useful for the analysis, classification and prediction
of the 3D structure of RNA motifs based on sequence signa-
tures in homologous RNA molecules, but also and importantly
for the structure-based alignment of homologous sequences
and the analysis of the evolution of RNA motifs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Definitions
Non-Watson–Crick base pairs. Just as WC base pairs combine
to form regular A-form RNA helices, non-WC base pairs
combine to form more complex ‘local RNA motifs’, which
we define operationally as ‘ordered arrays of non-WC base
pairs’ (12). Local motifs are composed of nucleotides that are
‘bracketed’ by secondary structure and thus include the hair-
pin, internal bulge and junction (or multi-helix) ‘loops’ that
punctuate and organize RNA secondary structures. We distin-
guish ‘local’ motifs from ‘composite’ motifs that are formed
by non-WC interactions involving distant regions of the
RNA, as defined by the secondary structure (see below for
examples). Such ordered arrays of non-WC base pairs are
clearly under structural constraints dictated by the formation
of the covalent linkages characteristic of the polynucleotide,
the stabilization provided by stacking interactions, as well as
the stereochemical preferences of the backbone torsion angles.
Furthermore, motifs can often be interrupted by variable num-
bers of extruded bases. Here, we focus on the constraints on the
base identity which are observable in homologous sequences.
Base pair classification. To systematically describe and anno-
tate non-WC base pairs in a manner that can elucidate the rules
for base substitutions in motifs, we classified them according
to simple geometric criteria: the base edges involved in
H-bonding interactions (Watson–Crick, Hoogsteen/CH or
Sugar-Edges) and the relative orientations of the glycosidic
bonds (cis or trans) of the interacting nucleotides (3). For each
of the twelve distinct geometric families of base pairs that
result from this classification, we introduced symbols to annot-
ate secondary structure drawings so as to display the decom-
position of motifs into non-WC base pairs.
Isosteric base pairs and Isostericity Matrices. To identify
isosteric base pairs, we begin with base pairs that belong to
the same geometric family because they share the same ‘rel-
ative orientations’ of the glycosidic bonds of their interacting
bases and so meet the first criterion for isostericity. However,
owing to the size difference between purine versus pyrimidine
bases, not all base pairs in the same geometric family have the
same C10–C10 distances separating the interacting bases. The
C10–C10 distance is therefore the second criterion for isosteri-
city. Thus, base pairs that are in the same geometric family
have roughly equal C10–C10 distances, and are hydrogen-
bonded between equivalent atomic positions and comprise
‘isosteric subgroups’ of base pairs. As optimal hydrogen-
bonding can result in shifts of one base relative to another,
base pairs that differ only in lateral shifting of the pairing
partners belong to almost isosteric subgroups. These base
pairs, while not exactly isosteric, may also substitute for
each other without significant distortion of motifs, as for
example the wobble and the WC pairs. We have presented
the isosteric subgroups in 4 · 4 Isostericity Matrices, one
for each geometric family (4). Isostericity Matrices therefore
indicate which base pairs in each geometric family can sub-
stitute for each other without distorting the 3D structure of the
motif to which they belong.
Sequence signatures of motifs. We define the ‘sequence sig-
nature’ of a motif as the set of nucleotide sequences that fold
to form the same 3D motif. The sequence signature is different
from the consensus sequence because it takes into account
coordinated changes needed to maintain non-WC base-pairing
and other base-specific interactions. Theoretical sequence sig-
natures for recurrent motifs can be generated combinatorially
from all possible isosteric base pairs for each non-WC pair
in the motif. Generally, it appears that other constraints—e.g.
base stacking and tertiary or quaternary RNA–RNA or RNA–
protein interactions—limit the possibilities to a smaller set of
sequences than predicted combinatorially.
Identical or nearly identical features that occur independ-
ently at non-equivalent positions are recurrent. Thus, ‘recur-
rent motifs’ are motifs that occur independently in RNA
molecules, whether the molecules are homologous or not.
Recurrent motifs usually have very similar 3D structures
and, consequently, similar, if not identical, sequence signa-
tures, depending on other constraints. Most recurrent motifs
are relatively small, but no upper limit on their size has been
determined. Kink-turns and C-loops represent examples of
recurrent motifs and are the focus of this study. Other
examples of recurrent motifs include GNRA and UNCG
‘hairpin’ loops or the sarcin/ricin and loop E ‘internal’ loops.
Corresponding motifs. We say two motifs ‘correspond’ to
each other when they occur at ‘equivalent positions’ in the
3D structures of a family of RNA molecules. For example, the
Kink-turns that occur at equivalent positions in Helix 7 of
different 23S rRNAs are corresponding motifs. Corresponding
motifs themselves are considered equivalent when their 3D
2396 Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 8
structures are essentially the same. The loop E motifs of homo-
logous 5S ribosomal RNAs occur at ‘equivalent positions’ and
interact with the same regions of their respective 23S rRNAs.
The loop E motifs of eukaryal and archaeal 5S rRNAs are also
‘equivalent motifs’ as they have the same 3D structures. How-
ever, the loop E motifs of bacterial and eukaryal 5S rRNAs
have different 3D structures and thus are examples of corres-
ponding motifs that are not equivalent. By definition, corres-
ponding motifs that are not equivalent cannot be aligned
nucleotide-by-nucleotide.
Methodological implementations
We manually aligned a set of ribosomal 16S and 23S rRNA
sequences extracted from fully sequenced genomes against the
available crystal structures of ribosomal RNAs. For Archaea
(A) and Bacteria (B) sequences, the atomic resolution crystal
structures of Haloarcula marismortui (H.m.) 23S rRNA
and Thermus thermophilus (T.th.) 16S rRNA were used to
define secondary structure masks for the sequence alignments
(13,14). In the text below, by default the nucleotide numbering
refers to those two crystal structures. To align the conserved
primary sequences, we added genomic RNA sequences in
a progressive fashion using clustalX (15). Sequences with
unidentified nucleotides within a given motif region were
not included in the statistics of that motif. For Archaea, 24
sequences of 16S and 23S rRNAs were used; for Bacteria,
800 16S rRNA sequences and 805 23S rRNA sequences were
aligned; for Eukarya (E), 5190 18S rRNA sequences and 133
28S rRNA sequences were considered (16). The sequence
alignments were analyzed using COSEQ, BioEdit (http://
www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/) and RNAMLview to deter-
mine covariations and substitutions at sequence positions
corresponding to non-WC pairs observed in crystal struc-
tures and to compare these to the corresponding Isostericity
Matrices (17).
Our procedure for analyzing an RNA motif family begins
with a detailed structural comparison of all occurrences of
the motif in crystal structures to identify characteristic and
variable structural features of the motif family. This step pro-
vides crucial information regarding variations in base-pairing
as well as positions where insertions or deletions occur. The
procedure we devised so as to (i) analyze the conservation of
RNA motifs and (ii) refine the structure-based alignments of
families of RNA molecules is shown in the Flow Chart in
Figure 1. The inputs, framed by rounded boxes, are (i) a set
of preliminary sequence alignments and (ii) the 3D structure of
one of the sequences in the alignment. For each motif, the
bases in the 3D structure forming non-WC base pairs are
identified (first square box, upper right). For each base pair
in the 3D structure, the corresponding nucleotides in each
sequence in the alignment are identified (second box on
right) and a covariation matrix is constructed using the current
alignment and then evaluated by comparison with the corres-
ponding Isostericity Matrix (third box on right). The procedure
is repeated for each base pair in the motif (fourth box on
right). If the base substitutions for all base pairs are isosteric
and insertions or deletions occur at reasonable positions, the
motif is considered aligned and conserved in the sequence
group (last box, lower right). If the covariation matrix for
one or more base pairs in the motif does not conform to the
corresponding Isostericity Matrix, improvement of the align-
ment is attempted, and the isostericities are checked at each
step, in an iterative manner (square box, middle left). When
further improvement is not possible, the sequences are grouped
according to those that conform to the Isostericity Matrices

for each base pair and those that do not, i.e. those in which the
motif is present and those in which it is not. For the latter,
alternative motifs are considered and evaluated in the same
manner (square box, lower left). Two examples, one for each
motif, of the matrices before and after analysis are shown
on Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Material. The
resulting sequence alignments can be obtained from the
authors upon request and on the web site (http://www-
ibmc.u-strasbg.fr/upr9002/westhof/). The secondary struc-
tures, with their attached Isostericity Matrices, for all motifs
analyzed and discussed below are presented in the Supple-
mentary Material (Figures S3 and S4).
RESULTS
Kink-turns
Characteristic features. Kink-turn motifs are recurrent internal
loops that produce sharp bends (kinks) in RNA helices (18).
The bend occurs on the shallow/minor groove side and,
consequently, brings together the shallow/minor grooves of
the two supporting helices. One helix, the so-called ‘C-stem’
(for ‘canonical-stem’), comprises only WC base pairs, while
the other so-called ‘NC-stem’ (for non-canonical-stem) is
composed of non-WC base pairs, usually two tandem sheared
(trans-H/SE) A/G base pairs that present the Watson–Crick
and Sugar-Edges of conserved Adenosines for interaction with
the shallow/minor groove of the C-stem. The interaction
involves tandem trans-SE base pairs, as also observed for
certain long-range RNA tertiary interactions, for example,
the interaction of the tandem ‘sheared’ G/A motif in Helix
101 (H101) of H.m. 23S rRNA (G2874/A2883 and A2875/
G2882) with the minor groove of H63 (C1786/G1806 and
C1787/G1805) (12). With the inclusion of the flanking base
pairs and the bases forming the non-WC base pairs, the
K-turns comprise about 13 nt. Five base pairs characterize
the motif and are found in almost all K-turns. These are num-
bered to facilitate the discussion as follows (see also Figure 2).
Figure 2. Stereographic view of a crystallographic structure of a typical Kink-turn (14,28) with its annotated secondary structure following the nomenclature for
non-WC pairs (3). Each characteristic base pair is circled in the 3D diagram with colors corresponding to those in the 2D diagram. The same color code is used to frame
the Isostericity Matrix attached to each base pair. Base pair 1 (BP1), colored orange, is cis-WC/WC; Base pair 2 (BP2), in red, is trans-H/SE; Base pair 3 (BP3), in
purple, is trans-H/SE; Base pair 4 (BP4), in blue, is trans-SE/SE; Base pair 5, in green, is trans-SE/SE. In each Isostericity Matrix, the families of isosteric pairs (I1, I2,
etc.) have an identical colored background. Parentheses indicate modeled interactions for the isosteric relationships not yet observed in high-resolution X-ray
structures (4).

 Base pair 1 (shown in orange in Figure 2) is the last canonical
cis-WC/WC base pair of the C-stem, flanking the internal
loop. It is usually G=C.
 Base pairs 2 and 3 (in red and purple, respectively) are usually
tandem trans-Hoogsteen/Sugar-Edge (trans-H/SE) and
occur at the end of the NC-stem.
 Base pair 4 (in blue) is trans-Sugar-Edge/Sugar-Edge (trans-
SE/SE) (type I A-minor interaction) and involves the
adenine of base pair 3 (purple) and the first nucleotide of
base pair 1 (orange).
 Base pair 5 (in green) is also trans-SE/SE and comprises the
adenine of base pair 2 in the NC-stem interacting with the
50-most unpaired base of the longer strand of the asym-
metric loop.
The corresponding Isostericity Matrices are also shown in
Figure 2. In the 2D schematic figures representing the motifs,
colored frames are placed around each non-WC base pair to
link them visually to the corresponding covariation tables
and Isostericity Matrices. Thus, red and purple frames indicate
trans-H/SE base pairs in the NC-stem and blue and green
frames indicate the trans-SE/SE tertiary base pairs whereby
the NC- and C-stems interact on their shallow/minor grooves.
The boxes of each matrix are colored to indicate which base
pairs belong to the same isosteric subgroups. Isosteric sub-
groups that are related by lateral shifts (as are the cis-WC and
wobble pairs) are colored with similar colors.
A list of K-turns, together with composite K-turn motifs
identified in the ribosome and other RNAs is given in Table 1.
The K-turn motifs are shown schematically in Figure 3. Each
K-turn in the ribosome is indicated by the molecule (16S or
23S) and the helix (or nearest helices) in which it occurs.
For example, 23S Kt-7 refers to the K-turn in Helix 7 of
23S rRNA and 16S Kt-11 refers to the K-turn in Helix 11
of 16S rRNA. For completeness, we list in Table 1 K-turns
identified in other protein–RNA complexes besides the ribo-
somal subunits: the U4 snRNP (19), the box H/ACA pseudo-
uridine synthases (20), the box C/D methylases (21) and the L1
mRNA autoregulatory element (22). These are not discussed
further. We exclude also from this analysis the ‘reverse K-
turn’, which kinks toward the deep/major groove instead of the
shallow/minor groove (23). Although several examples of
those reverse K-turns exist, they present, among the four
non-WC pairs characteristic of K-turns, only a single invariant
trans-H/SE G/A pair (equivalent to base pair 3 on Figure 2).
Thus, the reverse K-turns constitute an independent RNA
motif with specific constraints different from those of the
standard K-turns.
Structural variants. As noted above, the first non-WC basepair
of the NC-stem (the ‘red’ base pair) is present in almost every
structurally known K-turn and is conserved with regard to
geometry and even sequence (Figure 3). The one exception
is the ‘composite’ K-turn 23S Kt-77/78, in which the con-
served A2167 at this position is not paired. While the geometry
of base pair 1 (red) is very conserved, the second (purple) base
pair can be replaced by other, related base pair types, trans-
WC/H (16S Kt-23 and 16S Kt-11) or trans-H (23S Kt-4/5). All
of these base pair geometries have one feature in common:
they present the conserved A in the shallow/minor groove to
interact with the last base pair in the C-stem, forming Base

pair 4 (blue). Even more variation is displayed by the third
base pair of the NC-stem, which does not participate directly in
K-turn interactions. It is therefore not discussed any further.
Besides variations in base-pairing geometry, K-turn struc-
tures exhibit variations in the number of nucleotides in the
internal loop. Thus, H.m. 23S Kt-38 has one extra nucleotide in
the longer strand, which bulges out just above the NC-stem.
This is the most common point of insertion. Bases inserted
here have very little effect on the 3D structure of the motif.
Insertions also occur in the shorter strand, e.g. 23S Kt-15
(A248), 23S Kt-58 (A1591 and G1592) and 16S Kt-11
(U244 and C245). Unlike the insertions in the longer strand,
these usually participate in additional base pairs, as shown in
Figure 3.

Composite K-turns. Just as for sarcin/ricin loops (24), K-turns
can exist as composite motifs. Composite motifs have the
same (or very similar) base-pairing and base-stacking
interactions but more complex strand topologies. Three
composite K-turns have been identified, all of them in 23S
rRNA. One occurs in the complex junction in Domain I,
between Helix 4 and Helix 5. This K-turn has a discontinuity
in the shorter strand of the internal loop of the canonical motif.
The identical motif is observed in the H.m. and D.r. 23S crystal
structures and the break in the shorter strand occurs at
equivalent positions, between the nucleotides of the NC-
and C-stems (after U115 in the H.m or U118 in the D.r.).
The composite K-turn in the L1 binding region of Domain
V, occurs between Helices 77 and 78. Unlike the other com-
posite K-turns, a discontinuity occurs in the longer strand. This
region, which is not well resolved in the complete 50S struc-
tures, has been crystallized as an RNA fragment corresponding
to the T.th. 23S sequence, and includes all of Helix 77 and
parts of Helices 76 and 78 as well as the loop regions forming
the Kink-turn (22). The discontinuity occurs between C2163
and U2172 in the T.th. sequence. The third composite motif
occurs in Domain VI of H.m. 23S between Helices 94 and
99. Here, the discontinuity occurs in the shorter strand of the
asymmetric loop, between A2914 and G2667. Interestingly,
G2667 is located 30 to A2914 whereas in all other K-turns
the corresponding nucleotides are oriented with the opposite
polarity.
Isostericity Matrix analysis. Covariation tables were calcu-
lated for the characteristic base pairs of each K-turn from
the current alignments and the covariation tables were com-
pared to the corresponding Isostericity Matrices for the base
pair geometry identified in the crystal structures (Figure 2).
Figure 4 shows the annotated secondary structures for a typical
K-turn, Kt-46, for representative sequences from Archaea
(H.m.), Bacteria (D.r.) and Eukarya (Saccharomyces
Cerevisiae, S.c.). Crystal structures, available for the first
two, show that the K-turn is present in both. The secondary
structure and Isostericity Matrix for the S.c. motif indicates the
K-turn is also conserved in this sequence. The sequence vari-
ations for each of the five characteristic base pairs of the
K-turn are shown in the tables in Figure 4. To facilitate the
comparison, the observed values are presented in the tables in
the same orientation as the published Isostericity Matrices,
shown in Figure 2 (4). The three numbers given in each
box indicate the percentage of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryal
sequences in the alignments having the corresponding base
pair. These covariation tables are the result of iterations
carried out as shown in Figure 1.
The sequence variations for the first base pair (orange) are
typical of WC base pairs. All four WC base pairs occur in one
or more phylogenetic domain. The matrices for the trans
H/SE base pairs, the ‘red’ and ‘purple’ base pairs, show almost
exclusively a subset of isosteric group I1 from the Isostericity
Matrix for this base-pairing geometry. The exceptions occur in
Eukarya and include a small fraction of sequences with
disallowed base pairs (C/G) for which it appears that the
K-turn motif is not present. The small number of eukaryal
sequences for the 28S rRNA precludes firm conclusions on
those instances. Interestingly, for a significant percentage
of Eukarya, the ‘purple’ base pair is C/A, which is isosteric
to A/G. The trans-SE/SE base pairs 4 and 5 (green and blue)
involve the Hoogsteen base of the red and purple, which is
usually A and more rarely C, interacting with bases in the
C-stem, which can be A, C, G or U, as shown in the covariation
matrices. Again only a subset of the sequence variations per-
mitted by isostericity considerations is observed for each base
pair, when these are considered in isolation.
Thus, one observes that unsuspected concerted base changes
maintaining the order and the geometrical arrangements of the
base pairs constituting the motif occur. The observed sequence
variations show that the pairings follow the corresponding
Isostericity Matrix and, preferably, the same isosteric sub-
group. For some types of interactions only a sub-class of
pairings can occur. For example, in Figure 2 the matrix of
trans-SE/SE pairing, Bp 5 and Bp 6, show that only A and G
can serve as receptor of 20-OH of the second nucleotide
implicated in the interaction.
Sequence signatures. We have applied the procedure of
Figure 1 to each K-turn in the ribosome (see also Supplement-
ary Material S3). These covariation matrices are the final ones
calculated at the conclusion of the realignment process. The
matrices for individual K-turn motifs are combined in Figure 5
to provide aggregated statistics for K-turns. To construct the
matrices of Figure 5, counts were accumulated only from
sequences for which it was concluded that the corresponding
base pair is present. The resulting matrices define the sequence
signature for K-turns at the level of base pairs. It is apparent
that for each non-WC base pair, the sequence signature
includes a subset of the possible isosteric base pairs expected
from the Isostericity Matrices. This indicates the presence
of other constraints, including stacking interactions and
tertiary interactions involving one or both bases of a pair
(see Discussion).
C-loop motifs
Characteristic features. Like the K-turn, the C-loop motif is
an asymmetric internal loop (Figure 6). Two bases in the
longer strand form non-WC base pairs with bases in the shorter
strand. These bases belong to the flanking canonical base pairs.
A third base in the longer strand, usually an A, can and often
does interact with a third base pair, one removed from the
internal loop (Figure 7). Indeed, in two cases this base forms a
cis-WC/SE interaction. There are three C motifs in 23SrRNA
(14), one in 16SrRNA (13,25) and one in the mRNA of
threonine synthetase (26).
All C-loops in the ribosome are found in hairpin stem–loop
structures that engage in tertiary interactions involving the
hairpin loop. The C-loop itself increases the helical twist of
the stem between the two WC base pairs flanking the motif.
This probably optimizes the geometry of the interaction medi-
ated by the hairpin loop distal to the C-loop. However, the
large helical twist between the flanking base pairs (90)
greatly diminishes the stacking between them. Three nucle-
otides in the longer strand of the C-loop interact with the base
pairs flanking the motif by stacking and forming non-WC base
pairs. The first base in the loop is usually a C (and hence
‘C-loop’), and it stacks below the preceding flanking base
pair where it forms a trans-WC/H interaction in the major/
deep groove with the second base pair flanking the motif, thus
reinforcing the large helical twist between the flanking base
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 8 2401
pairs. The third base of the longer strand stack above the
second flanking base pair and forms cis WC/SE base
pairs with the base pair above it. The shorter strand usually
has one or two unpaired nucleotides that are invariably
extruded. In all C-loops in the ribosome, the extruded bases
engage in tertiary interactions, some of which are long range
and involve RNA elements directly implicated in ribosome
function. A schematic figure of a typical C-loop motif is shown
in Figure 6 with the four characteristic base pairs of the motif
framed in colored boxes to visually link them to the corres-
ponding Isostericity Matrices and covariation tables. Schem-
atic diagrams of C-loops observed in crystal structures are
shown in Figure 7. These diagrams show that C-loops can
differ in the number of extruded bases in the shorter strand
as well as the number of bases in the longer strand. Thus, 23S
C38 has two extruded bases in the shorter strand, C50 has one,
and C96, one or two, while in 16S C15 the extruded base
occurs after the flanking base pair.
Isostericity Matrix analysis. For each of the C-loop motifs
identified in the ribosome, covariation matrices for each of
the base pairs were determined from the current alignments
and compared to the corresponding Isostericity Matrices
(see Supplementary Material S4). The analysis for a typical

Figure 5. Aggregated tables of sequence variations for each of the characteristic base pairs of conserved Kink-turns. The data for the conserved Kink-turns are given.
These serve to define the sequence signatures for Kink-turn motifs. For pair 1 (orange cis-WC/WC), the number of sequences were A= 264, B= 5625, E = 10 846. For
Pair 2 (red trans-H/SE), A = 240, B = 4820, E = 10 713; KT-77/78 was excluded, since pair 2 is absent. For Pair 3 (purple trans-H/SE), A = 168, B = 2415 and E = 266.
The following K-turns were excluded: KT-4/5 where trans-H/SE is replaced by trans-H/H base pair; KT-42 where trans-H/SE is absent in X-ray structure
although bases are present; KT-23 where trans-H/SE is replaced by trans-WC/H base pair (see below); KT-11 where trans-H/SE is replaced by trans-WC/H
base pair (see below). For Pair 3 (purple trans-WC/H), A = 48, B = 1600 and E = 10 377. KT-11 and KT-23 were taken into account. For Pair 4 (blue trans-SE/SE),
A = 216, B = 5625 and E = 10 846. The following were excluded: KT-58 where pair 4 is absent in the structure; KT-15 where trans-SE/SE is replaced by a cis-SE/SE
base pair. For Pair 5 (green trans-SE/SE), A = 264, B = 5625 and E = 10 846.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 8 2403
C-loop motif, 23S C96, is shown in Figure 8. The first cis-WC/
WC pair (red box) of the motif, G2763=C2717 in the
H.m. sequence, is almost exclusively G=C in Archaea and
Bacteria, but in Eukarya A–U and A–C are also represented.
The second cis-WC/WC base pair (green box) of the motif is
almost exclusively A/U in all three phylogenetic groups. They
otherwise follow the diagonal repartition typical of WC pairs.
Base pair 2 (purple), the trans-WC/H pair, is almost exclus-
ively C/A as in the crystal structure, but some isosteric C/G
occur in Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya (isosteric subgroup 1)
while A/A which has a distinctly longer C10–C10 distance and
is not isosteric to the other base pairs (isosteric subgroup 2)
also occurs in Eukarya. No crystal structure of a C-loop with
the trans-WC/H A/A pair is known at this time. Regarding the
cis-WC/SE pair of C96 (BP 3, blue), only C/G is observed for
Archaea while the isosteric C/A base pair also occurs in Bac-
teria. U/A occurs in most eukaryal sequences but U/G and C/
G are also represented too. C/C is observed for BP3 in the
crystal structures C38 and C50, while C/G is observed in C96
and A/C is observed in 16S C15 in the crystal structure of the
T.th. 16S rRNA. The cis-WC/SE A/N pairs form an isosteric
subgroup with a longer C10–C10 distance than the C/N pairs.
The presence of A/C therefore modifies the geometry of the
16S C15 motif noticeably, compared to the other C-loops, but
not so radically as to disrupt the other base pairs of the motif
(see below).
About half the bacterial sequences for C50 have G at the
position corresponding to C1426, implying G1426/C1437
(H.m. numbering) for the trans-WC/H base pair, a pairing
that cannot exist. In these sequences, the second flanking
WC base pair of the motif (BP4) is invariably G1429/
C1437 (H.m. numbering) and the cis-WC/SE (BP3) is always
A1428/C1439. While the D.r. 23S sequence provides an
example of this variant and the crystal structure shows that
the G corresponding to G1426 is in the deep/major groove, the
structure is not resolved well enough to determine the nature
of the interactions. Surprising variations occur in Eukarya for
C50 and C96, which cannot be properly assessed owing to the
lack of structures and the limited number of sequences. Most
Eukarya (65%) have G/G for the trans-WC/H base pair of
C50 (corresponding to C1426/A1437 in H.m.), which is not
observed in other C-loops, but is nearly isosteric to the

the Isostericity Matrix attached to each base pair. Base pair 1 (BP1) is colored red: cis-WC/WC; Base pair 2 (BP2) in purple: trans-WC/H; Base pair 3 (BP3) in blue:
cis-WC/SE; Base pair 4 (BP4) in green: cis-WC/WC. In each Isostericity Matrix, the families of isosteric pairs (I1, I2, etc.) have an identical colored background.
Parentheses indicate modeled interactions for the isosteric relationships not yet observed in high-resolution X-ray structures (4).

subgroup that includes A/A, A/G and G/U. Interestingly, some
Eukarya have A/G (2.3%) or G/U (0.8%). In 23S C96, most
Eukarya have A/A for the trans-WC/H while a small percent-
age show G/G (0.9%). These sequences have U/A or U/G for
the cis-WC/SE pair. U is not observed widely in BP3 of other
C-loops, so this combination may signal a further variant of
the motif.
Sequence signatures. The aggregated covariation matrices
for C-loops are shown in Figure 9. Except for base pair 2,
the Isostericity Matrices are obeyed. Since base pair 2, the
trans-WC/H pair, is central to the definition of a C-motif,
those related motifs are designated ‘C-like motifs’. Some
C-motifs show additional base pairs (e.g. C15 and C38).
The additional base pairs behave differently in their corres-
ponding Isostericity Matrices (Figure 10). The additional base
pair in C15, a cis-WC/SE pair, follows the Isostericity Matrix.
On the contrary, the additional base pair in C38, a trans-WC/
SE pair, occupies three subgroups in the matrix, all compat-
ible, but not isosteric. The latter pair is, thus, rather variable
and opportunistic, and forms in response to the environment.
C-like loops. The 2D diagrams of two C-like motifs are shown
in Figure 11. In those C-like motifs, the high twist angle
between the flanking base pairs is maintained but base pair 2
is absent. The usual C residue is replaced by other nucleotides
and, in the 3D structures, it points away from the loop towards
the exterior, sometimes forming an additional pair. Base pair
3, the cis-WC/SE, is present and, interestingly, a supplement-
ary pair appears, also cis-WC/SE, equivalent to the one which
occasionally, but in a constrained fashion, appears in the
C-motifs (e.g. 16S C15).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The systematic comparisons between structures, sequences
and Isostericity Matrices have shown that deviations of
covariation matrices from the corresponding Isostericity
Matrices indicate either incorrect sequence alignment or
change of motifs between species or phylogenetic groups.
Through the iterative application of the procedures in Figure 1,
it was possible to realign some sequences to correct several

discrepancies between the covariation and Isostericity
Matrices. When realignment did not improve the agreement
between observed covariations and Isostericity Matrices, the
particular motif was identified either as a variant of the struc-
turally characterized parent motif or as absent and replaced by
a structurally distinct motif in that sequence or phylogenetic
group of sequences. Figures 5 and 9 provide data for construct-
ing sequence signatures for K-turn and C-loop motifs. In order
to best take into account the covariations observed for some
non-WC base pairs, isosteric subgroups should be grouped into
structurally similar groups that are related by lateral shifts.
This is exactly what is done for wobble and WC pairs, which
are not identical, but which can co-vary without disrupting
or distorting regular A-type helices. The comparison between
the data in Figures 5 and 9 with the respective Isostericity
Matrices shows that generally a subset of possible base
pairs identified in the Isostericity Matrices actually occur in
the sequence signatures. This observation shows the central
importance of geometrical conservation in the rules of
transformation during RNA evolution.
Thus, the variations in RNA motifs are constrained at
different levels: (i) The base changes follow the Isostericity
Matrices corresponding to the nature of the non-WC pair.
There is a strong tendency to vary within the same isosteric
subgroup within a given matrix. (ii) For some non-WC pairs, a
closely related pair, not strictly isosteric, can occur. (iii)
Within the motif, the length of some unpaired segment of
nucleotides can vary, usually at identical insertion sites. (iv)
The loss of one characteristic non-WC pair leads to structural
variants of the motifs.
Superimposed on those general constraints, other structural
constraints specific to the motif type or due to the particular
environment come into play. For example, each trans-H/SE
base pair in the NC-stem of the K-turn exhibits A as the
Hoogsteen base and almost never C. In other motifs where
trans-H/SE base pairs occur, C is often observed to substitute
for A. The exclusive occurrence of A in the trans-H/SE base
pairs of K-turn motifs can be understood by the added con-
straint due to the observation that these A residues mediate the
shallow/minor-groove interactions with the C-stem, crucial for
the folding of K-turn motifs, and for which adenines are the
best suited (18,27).

motifs. An additional pair is present (black). In grey are shown the usual pairs
of the C-motifs.

Our analysis identifies sequences or groups of sequences in
which K-turns are not conserved. These are given at the level
of phylogenetic groups in Table 1. Some K-turn or C-loop
motifs do not appear to be conserved in some sequences even
though they appear to be present in most other sequences in
their phylogenetic groups. K-turns are not the only motifs
producing sharp bends on the shallow/minor groove sides
of helices. Motifs that produce similar effects occur in
Helix 68 of H.m. 23S rRNA, Helix 41 of T.th. 16S rRNA,
and between P5 and P5a in certain Group I introns. Moreover,
K-turns can occur as complex composite motifs that are dif-
ficult to identify in the absence of 3D structure. Thus, it is not
surprising that for some sequences and even whole phylogen-
etic domains, K-turns are not conserved. Our analysis, sum-
marized in Table 1, shows that Kink-turns are conserved
across the three major phylogenetic domains for Kt-42 and
Kt-46 in 23S rRNA and for Kt-11 and Kt-23 in 16S rRNA. The
Kt-7 motif is conserved in Archaea and Bacteriae, while the
Kt-15, K-38 and Kt-58 motifs are only conserved in Archaea.
Similarly, except for C50, the C-loop motifs in 16S and
23S rRNA appear to be conserved in all three phylogenetic
domains. The composite Kt-4/5 and Kt-77/78 motifs appear to
be conserved in all three domains, but Kt-94/99 does not
appear to be conserved. These examples mirror the composite
sarcin/ricin motifs (24) and emphasize the role of structural
constraints underlying RNA motifs beyond the conservation of
the nature of the base pairs, like stacking, hydrogen bonding,
and 30–50 covalent linkages.
In summary, we have shown that Isostericity Matrices pro-
vide tools for productive iteration of multiple sequence align-
ment of RNA sequences. For this process to be successful,
several goals must be met simultaneously: (i) corresponding
motifs must be identified in homologous sequences and it must
be determined which are structurally conserved. (ii) Insertions
and deletions must be correctly positioned and bases forming
structurally conserved base pairs characteristic of the motif
must be aligned. (iii) Sequences forming alternative motifs
must be identified, segregated from the other sequences, and
aligned separately. We have demonstrated the use of Isosteri-
city Matrix to iteratively refine rRNA sequence alignments
for the biologically significant and recurrent K-turn and
C-loop motifs, and identified sequences or phylogenetic
groups for which the motifs were not conserved. We have
constructed sequence signatures that can be used to search
for these motifs in sequences. This body of data contributes
to a programmed process of automatic identification, annota-
tion and prediction of RNA motifs in sequence alignments.
The key conclusion that emerges from this work is that
the structural content, quality and pertinence of RNA sequence
alignments depends crucially on a careful analysis of
RNA motifs. Together with the use of Isostericity
Matrices of non-WC base pairs and the definition of RNA
motifs as ordered arrays of non-WC base pairs under con-
straints, the rich 3D information hidden within sequences
can be extracted. As a corollary, attempts to align structurally
non-equivalent motifs at the nucleotide level fail and give
nonsensical results.
