ABSTRACT
Like other eukaryotes, plants use DICER-LIKE (DCL)
proteins as the central enzymes of RNA silencing,
which regulates gene expression and mediates
defense against viruses. But why do plants like
Arabidopsis express four DCLs, a diversity un-
matched by other kingdoms? Here we show that
two nuclear DNA viruses (geminivirus CaLCuV and
pararetrovirus CaMV) and a cytoplasmic RNA
tobamovirus ORMV are differentially targeted by
subsets of DCLs. DNA virus-derived small interfer-
ing RNAs (siRNAs) of specific size classes (21, 22
and 24 nt) are produced by all four DCLs, including
DCL1, known to process microRNA precursors.
Specifically, DCL1 generates 21 nt siRNAs from the
CaMV leader region. In contrast, RNA virus infection
is mainly affected by DCL4. While the four DCLs are
partially redundant for CaLCuV-induced mRNA
degradation, DCL4 in conjunction with RDR6 and
HEN1 specifically facilitates extensive virus-induced
silencing in new growth. Additionally, we show that
CaMV infection impairs processing of endogenous
RDR6-derived double-stranded RNA, while ORMV
prevents HEN1-mediated methylation of small RNA
duplexes, suggesting two novel viral strategies of
silencing suppression. Our work highlights the com-
plexity of virus interaction with host silencing
pathways and suggests that DCL multiplicity helps
mediate plant responses to diverse viral infections.
INTRODUCTION
RNA silencing in multicellular plants and animals is
mediated by 21–24 nt small RNAs (sRNAs) that guide
sequence-specific gene regulation, chromatin modification,
and defense against viruses. These sRNAs are broadly classi-
fied into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs), which have similar chemical structures but differ
in function and mode of biogenesis. Production of both
types of sRNAs depends on the activity of dicer proteins.
Plants such as Arabidopsis have evolved a diversity of
RNA silencing pathways, sRNA classes and DICER-LIKE
(DCL) genes that is unmatched in other eukaryotes (1–4).
Like their animal counterparts, plant miRNAs are excised
from stem-loop structures of primary miRNA gene transcripts
by DCL1 in cooperation with its binding partner HYL1 (5,6).
The resulting miRNA/miRNA* duplex is loaded onto the
argonaute family protein AGO1, the slicer component of
the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (7), which in
turn is guided to the complementary target mRNAs by the
miRNA strand.
In contrast to miRNAs, endogenous siRNAs are cleaved
from long perfect double-stranded (ds) RNAs, which are
themselves products of specific RNA-dependent RNA poly-
merase (RDR) activities (8). DCL4 and DCL3 process such
dsRNA substrates to produce the predominant siRNA size
classes, 21 and 24 nt, respectively (3,4). Like miRNAs,
certain DCL4-dependent endogenous 21 nt siRNAs silence
their target genes in trans (9). These trans-acting siRNAs
(ta-siRNAs) associate with AGO-RISC (7) and target com-
plementary mRNAs for cleavage and degradation. The
biogenesis of ta-siRNAs depends on miRNA-directed cleav-
age of non-coding TAS transcripts to generate products that
are converted by RDR6 into dsRNA substrates for DCL4
(10–13). The DCL3-dependent 24 nt siRNAs, mostly derived
from repetitive DNA loci (repeat-associated siRNAs;
ra-siRNA), likely mediate the establishment and maintenance
of chromatin states through RNA-dependent DNA methyla-
tion and histone modification (2). The biogenesis of
ra-siRNAs requires the RNA polymerases POL IVa and
RDR2 (14,15). Another argonaute protein, AGO4, is involved
in the ra-siRNA pathway, probably as the effector component

of the putative RNA-induced transcriptional silencing
complex (16,17).
A subsequent step in the biogenesis of all plant sRNAs is
methylation of their 30-terminal nucleotide at the 20-hydroxyl
group by the methyltransferase HEN1 (18–20), which
protects them from degradation and oligouridylation (21).
RNA silencing that affects transgene expression can spread
locally cell-to-cell and systemically via vascular tissues
throughout the plant (22,23). Although the nature of the
sequence-specific silencing signal is unknown, cell-to-cell
spread of transgene silencing is correlated with DCL4-
generated 21 nt siRNAs (24). Interestingly, longer-range
cell-to-cell movement of transgene silencing requires RDR6
(25), which is normally coupled to DCL4 for the biogenesis
of 21 nt ta-siRNAs. It is speculated that RDR6 is involved
in a relay amplification of the silencing signal (25). RDR6
was also implicated in systemic transgene silencing (26).
The spread of the silencing signal is a potential component
of plant defense against ongoing virus infections, especially
for protection of the shoot apical meristem (26).
More generally, RNA silencing may represent an adaptive
immune response of plants against viruses (27). sRNAs of
distinct size-classes have been detected in plants infected
with RNA viruses of different families (28–31) and DNA
geminiviruses (19,32). RNA viruses are mainly targeted by
DCL4 and DCL2, which produce 21 and 22 nt viral siRNAs
(29–31). Our previous work implicated DCL2 and DCL3 in
production of 22 and 24 nt geminiviral siRNAs, respectively,
and an additional DCL activity producing 21 nt geminiviral
siRNAs (19). Neither the function of these geminivirus-
derived siRNAs, nor siRNA biogenesis for other DNA
viruses has been examined using the genetic resources
acquired from the study of endogenous sRNA species.
Viruses modified to carry a sequence homologous to a
host-encoded gene are informative tools for studying siRNA-
dependent silencing. Such constructs can trigger silencing of
the homologous gene at both post-transcriptional and
transcriptional levels (27). This phenomenon is called virus
induced gene silencing (VIGS). RDR6 and its cofactor
SGS3 are important for VIGS triggered by both RNA virus
(RNA-VIGS) (27) and DNA geminivirus vectors (DNA-
VIGS) (33). Recently, DCL4- and DCL2-dependent viral
siRNAs have been implicated in RNA-VIGS (30). Similar
to transgene-induced silencing, VIGS can spread cell-to-cell
and systemically (27). Peele et al. (34) revealed virus-
independent spreading of DNA-VIGS from geminivirus-
infected tissues to the shoot apical meristem, from which
viruses are normally excluded. The pathways mediating
DNA-VIGS have not been thoroughly dissected; given the
cytoplasmic and nuclear steps in replication of DNA viruses,
they are ideal for studying virus-induced RNA silencing in its
entirety. Furthermore, DNA viruses do not code for their own
RDRs and are therefore useful for examining the role of host
RDRs in different silencing processes.
Despite silencing-based responses to viral infection, plant
viruses can still establish robust infection in susceptible
hosts, in part by suppressing RNA silencing. Plant viruses
encode various suppressor proteins that do not share common
features, although many of them bind short or long dsRNA
(35,36). For example, the RNA tombusvirus-encoded
suppressor P19 binds siRNA duplexes selectively, which
might sequester them from the silencing process (37). Viral
silencing suppressors can cause defects in endogenous silenc-
ing pathways when expressed from transgenes (38), possibly
due to their dsRNA binding property.
Here we describe genetic requirements for the biogenesis
of 21, 22 and 24 nt siRNAs associated with DNA viruses
of the geminivirus [Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV)] and
the pararetrovirus [Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)] fami-
lies, which form circular minichromosomes in the nucleus
(39,40). We contrast this to the predominantly 21 nt siRNAs
derived from a cytoplasmic RNA tobamovirus [Oilseed rape
mosaic virus (ORMV)] (41). We show that the three viruses
are differentially targeted by the four Arabidopsis DCLs
producing specific size classes of viral siRNAs. Using
a geminivirus VIGS vector (42) and Arabidopsis silencing
mutants we find the four DCLs to be partially redundant for
DNA-VIGS targeting an endogenous mRNA. However,
extensive VIGS in newly emerging tissues requires DCL4
in conjunction with RDR6 and HEN1. As a derivative of
this study with CaMV and ORMV, we also uncover two
novel viral strategies of silencing suppression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plants and viruses
The following previously described Arabidopsis mutant lines
were used: dcl1-8 [in Col-gl1, originally: sin1-2; (43)], dcl1-9
[in La-er; originally: caf-1; (43)], dcl2-5 [in Col-0; (19)],
dcl3-1 [in Col-0; (29)], dcl4-2 [in Col-0; (12)], rdr2-1 [in
Col-0; (29)], rdr6-15 [in Col-0; (10)], nrpd1a-3 [in Col-0;
(14)], ago4-1 [in La-er; (16)], hyl1-2 and hen1-5 [both in
Col-0; (44)]. To obtain the double mutant dcl2 dcl3 (d2d3),
dcl2-5 was crossed with dcl3-1. Homozygous d2d3 was
then crossed with dcl4-2 to obtain homozygous double
mutants dcl2 dcl4 (d2d4) and dcl3 dcl4 (d3d4) and the triple
mutant dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 (d2d3d4) in the F2 segregating popula-
tion. Homozygous lines were selected using PCR with allele-
specific primers (see Supplementary Data).
Arabidopsis wt and mutant plants were grown from seeds
in soil in a phytochamber (Sanyo) at 20C with 12 h day and
12 h night. Four to five weeks post-germination, unless
otherwise stated, seedlings were inoculated with CaLCuV
or CaMV by biolistic delivery of a plasmid mixture (0.5 mg
each) of pMTCbLCVA.008 and pCPCbLCVB.002 (42) or 1
mg plasmid pCa122 [the CaMV strain CM1841; (45)],
respectively, as described earlier (19).
One month post-inoculation, unless otherwise stated, virus-
infected plants were harvested in pools and ground in liquid
nitrogen for total RNA (19) and DNA (46) preparations.
Titers of the viruses were determined by semi-quantitative
duplex PCR (see Supplementary Data).
Mechanical inoculation of Arabidopsis plants with ORMV
(41) was performed at around 5 weeks post-germination using
celite 545 (Merck) and sap of ORMV-infected Nicotiana
benthamiana.
RNA blot hybridization
Total RNA preparation, size-fractionation, b-elimination
and RNA blot hybridization were performed as described

replicates).
RESULTS
Three size classes of DNA virus-derived siRNAs
Using a reverse genetics approach we investigated the RNA
silencing-based response of plants to DNA virus infection.
In experiments described separately below, we inoculated
Arabidopsis plants with the pararetrovirus CaMV (45)
and with a recombinant geminivirus CaLCuV, which carries
a segment of the Arabidopsis Chlorata I (ChlI) gene
(CaLCuV::Chl) (42). The latter construct also allowed us to
study the genetic requirements for VIGS.
Both viruses established systemic infections in Arabidopsis,
accompanied by deformations on young and old leaves one
month post-inoculation (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure
S1). As expected, CaLCuV::Chl triggered VIGS of the
endogenous ChlI gene, resulting in a yellow-white (‘chlo-
rata’) phenotype in emerging inner rosette leaves
(Figure 1A), described earlier by Muangsan et al. (42). Infec-
tion with CaLCuV::Chl (Figure 1C), but not with CaMV
(data not shown), greatly reduced the ChlI mRNA content
of total RNA prepared from whole plants, indicating efficient,
sequence-specific VIGS at the whole plant level. Mature
leaves that developed before inoculation with CaLCuV::Chl
did not exhibit the chlorata phenotype, likely due to residual
CHLI protein or its dispensability later in development for
maintaining high chlorophyll content.
Wild-type (wt) accessions Col-0, Col-gl1 and La-er
infected with CaLCuV::Chl and CaMV accumulated similar
patterns of 21, 22 and 24 nt sRNAs of both sense and
antisense polarities, from both coding and non-coding regions
(Figures 2 and 3). Based on these and other findings for
geminiviruses (19), we conclude that both families of DNA
viruses produce three distinct size-classes of siRNAs.

successively hybridized with random-labeled DNA probes for ChlI, ACT2 and CaLCuV AC2/AC3 transcripts. (D) Quantitative real-time PCR was made on
cDNA synthesized from RNA pools. The mean from triplicate determinations of ChlI transcript levels was normalized to each corresponding ACT2 mean; the
Col-0 (mock) level was set to 1.

Since the levels of siRNAs derived from the CaLCuV-
based ChlI sequence and the virus genes (AC4 and AC2)
were equally high [Figure 2 and (19)], we assume that most
ChlI siRNAs are produced from viral AV1-ChlI chimeric
transcripts rather than endogenous ChlI mRNA, which accu-
mulates to lower levels. Further supporting this assertion, sec-
ondary siRNAs from ChlI mRNA regions flanking the target
sequence were barely detectable (data not shown).
Specific deficiencies in endogenous RNA silencing
pathways affect viral siRNA production and impair
VIGS
The presence of different size classes of viral siRNAs
suggested that multiple RNA silencing pathways respond
to DNA viruses. To determine the relative contribution
of these pathways, we examined the effect of well-character-
ized, T-DNA insertion deficiency mutants on the infection
process, VIGS, and the accumulation of viral siRNAs.
We first focused on mutants of DCL2, DCL3, DCL4, RDR2
and RDR6, which mediate the biogenesis of endogenous
siRNAs (4).
None of these mutants differed markedly from wt in devel-
opment or severity of CaLCuV symptoms (Figure 1A). One
month post-inoculation, viral DNA was measured in pools
of 3–4 plants by semi-quantitative duplex PCR. CaLCuV
DNA accumulation in dcl2, dcl3, and rdr2 was comparable
to that of wt, while slightly higher in dcl4 and rdr6
(Figure 1B). Similarly, CaLCuV transcripts measured by
RNA blot hybridization were comparable in dcl2, dcl3,
rdr2 and wt, and elevated in dcl4 and rdr6 (Figure 1C,
viral AC2/3 RNA). Strikingly, dcl4 and rdr6, exhibited
almost no chlorata phenotype in new growth, while dcl2,
dcl3 and rdr2 developed yellow-white inner rosette leaves
similar to the wt infection (Figure 1A). Thus, although
none of these mutants had dramatic effects on virus infection,
DCL4 and RDR6 were required for extensive Chl-VIGS
in newly emerging leaves. Interestingly, DCL4 is required
for cell-to-cell spread of transgene-induced silencing in
Arabidopsis (24), raising a possibility that this dicer is
involved in production of a virus-induced silencing signal
as well (see Discussion).
We compared the effect of these mutants on the accumula-
tion of viral siRNAs and ChlI mRNA. The decreased

markers. (A) Analysis of mock Col-0 and virus-infected Col-0, dcl- and rdr-mutant plants. (B) Analysis of mock Col-0, virus-infected controls (Col-gl1, La-er,

accumulation of siRNAs in mutants relative to wt shows that
DCL4 is required for 21 nt siRNA, DCL2 for 22 nt siRNA,
and DCL3 for 24 nt siRNA accumulation (Figure 2A).
Interestingly, the elimination of 21 nt viral siRNAs and
endogenous ta-siRNAs (siR255) in dcl4 was associated with
an increase in 22 and 24 nt species. Similarly, the elimination
of 24 nt viral siRNAs and reduction in the 24 nt ra-siRNA
(siR1003) in dcl3 correlated with an increase in 22 and 21
nt species. This indicates that other DCLs compensate for
deficiencies in a specific DCL during the production of
viral siRNAs. Similar observations were reported previously
for endogenous sRNAs (11). In contrast, accumulation of
viral siRNAs did not decrease in rdr2 or rdr6 (Figure 2A),
indicating that viral siRNAs do not arise from known
RDR-dependent endogenous RNA silencing pathways.
Levels of ChlI mRNA were reduced in all the mutant and
wt plants infected with CaLCuV::Chl (Figure 1C and D).
Therefore Chl-VIGS at the whole plant level depends neither
on a single, specific size class of viral siRNA nor on RDR6
per se. Nevertheless, VIGS knock-down of ChlI mRNA
was less potent in dcl4 and rdr6 (ca. 50%) than in wt, dcl2,
dcl3 and rdr2 (Figure 1D); this correlated with the absence
of chlorata whitening in newly formed tissues (Figure 1A).
Similar results were obtained when non-inoculated inner
rosette leaves of CaLCuV::Chl-infected dcl4 and rdr6 plants
were analyzed for the ChlI mRNA levels (Supplementary
Figure S2). Either the marginal enrichment in ChlI mRNA
levels in these two mutants is sufficient to exceed the thresh-
old level of CHLI required for chlorophyll synthesis in new
growth or, more likely, the DCL4/RDR6-dependent silencing
process underlying extensive spread of the chlorata pheno-
type initiates at very early stages of leaf development (see
Discussion). We conclude that although DCL4 and RDR6
are not absolutely required for VIGS-mediated knockdown
of ChlI mRNA in infected tissues, these genes play a special
role in the establishment and/or maintenance of extensive
VIGS in newly emerging leaves absent before inoculation.
Similar to our results for CaLCuV, CaMV-infected dcl and
rdr plants exhibited no drastic effect on viral symptoms or
titers (Supplementary Figure S1). Also, the biogenesis of
24 and 22 nt CaMV siRNAs required DCL3 and DCL2,
respectively (Figure 3A). Production of CaMV 21 nt siRNAs

was not abolished in dcl4 (Figure 3A), suggesting that unlike
CaLCuV, a different DCL (e.g. DCL1) produces the remain-
ing fraction of CaMV 21-nt siRNAs. The ratio between
21 and 24 nt siRNAs varied for different CaMV regions
tested, with the lowest ratio for the TAV coding region.
Furthermore, the effect of dcl4 on the relative accumulation
of 21 nt viral siRNAs was more pronounced for TAV coding
and L2 non-coding regions than for the L1 non-coding region
(Figure 3). Presently, it is unclear why relative DCL specifici-
ties vary for different viral regions. An intriguing possibility
is that structural features of viral dsRNA and stem–loop
substrates derived from those regions (see Discussion)
determine the DCL specificity.
The mutants rdr2 and rdr6 showed no deficiency
for CaMV siRNA accumulation, indicating that like for
CaLCuV, RDR2- and RDR6-dependent pathways are not
required (Figure 3A). We obtained further evidence distin-
guishing viral siRNA biogenesis from endogenous pathways
using loss-of-function mutants of POL IVa and AGO4 (com-
ponents of the ra-siRNA pathway). Although accumulation of
siR1003 was abolished in nrpd1a-3, a null allele of the
POL IVa largest subunit (14), no effect was found on
viral symptoms, titers, siRNA production or the spread of
Chl-VIGS (Supplementary Figure S3). Thus POL IVa is not
part of the plant response to DNA viruses associated with
24 nt viral siRNAs. In ago4 plants [La-er background (16)],
a reduced accumulation of CaLCuV and CaMV siRNAs was
observed, which correlated with a similar reduction in
siR1003 levels (Supplementary Figure S3C and D). However,
viral symptoms and titers were similar to those of the wild
type control plants (Supplementary Figure S3A and B).
Note that in CaLCuV::Chl-infected ago4 and La-er plants
the Chl-VIGS phenotype of inner rosette was generally less
developed (Supplementary Figure S3A), possibly because
they bolted soon after inoculation.
DNA virus infection, viral siRNA biogenesis and VIGS
in mutants for miRNA biogenesis
To test whether the miRNA pathway is important for
production of siRNAs from DNA viruses, we inoculated the
mutants dcl1-8, dcl1-9, hyl1-2 and hen1-5, which are all
deficient for miRNA biogenesis (43,44).
Due to these mutants’ retarded, abnormal development, it
was difficult to evaluate virus susceptibility and symptoms.
To obtain comparable sized plants, mutants were inoculated
one month later than wt plants. Symptom development caused
by both viruses was delayed in the mutants. CaLCuV::Chl-
infected hen1-5 showed decreased Chl-VIGS whitening in
emerging leaves compared to wt, dcl1-8, dcl1-9 and hyl1-2
(Supplementary Figure S4A). Two months post-inoculation,
viral titers in all miRNA biogenesis mutants were comparable
to wt levels for CaLCuV (data not shown) and CaMV (Figure
S4B). The accumulation of 21, 22 and 24 nt CaLCuV siRNAs
of both polarities was similar in dcl1-8, dcl1-9, hyl1-2 and wt
plants (Figure 2B), whereas the controls siR255 and miR173
were undetectable in dcl1-8 and dcl1-9 and reduced in
hyl1-2. Therefore, HYL1 and DCL1 are not required for
biogenesis of the CaLCuV siRNAs tested.
During CaMV infection the relative accumulation of 21 nt
viral siRNAs was strongly reduced in dcl1-9 and less strongly
in dcl1-8 (Figure 3B). The fact that dcl1-8 carries a point
mutation in the DCL1 helicase domain, while dcl1-9 has a
T-DNA disruption in the DCL1 dsRNA binding domain
(43) suggests that the latter domain is more important for
21 nt viral siRNA biogenesis. The truncated DCL1 protein
likely expressed in dcl1-9 has been implicated in production
of aberrant miRNAs (5). This defective DCL1 as well as
DCL4 (see above) might therefore contribute together to
production of the remaining fraction of viral 21 nt siRNAs
in this mutant background. A reduced accumulation of 21
nt CaMV siRNA was also observed in hyl1-2 (Figure 3B),
indicating that the DCL1 binding partner HYL1 (6) facilitates
the biogenesis of a fraction of 21 nt CaMV siRNAs.
In hen1-5, the patterns of CaLCuV and CaMV siRNAs
were slightly retarded, with additional 23–25 nt bands
detected (Figures 2B and 3B). All these viral species, as
well as endogenous sRNAs were sensitive to b-elimination
in hen1-5, whereas those from wt plants were resistant (Sup-
plementary Figure S5 and data not shown). Thus all
size-clases of siRNAs derived from both plant DNA viruses
are methylated by HEN1. Since CaLCuV::Chl-infected
hen1-5 exhibited little chlorata whitening in newly formed
tissues (Figure S4A), HEN1-mediated methylation of viral
siRNAs is important for extensive VIGS in emerging leaves.
Effect of double and triple dcl-mutants on viral siRNA
production and DNA-VIGS
Redundancy and compensation in the DCL family was
investigated by examining the effect of double mutants
d2d3, d2d4, d3d4 and the triple mutant d2d3d4 on virus
infection (see Materials and Methods concerning crosses).
CaLCuV::Chl inoculation resulted in normal viral symptom
development; viral titers were similar in wt and mutant plants
(data not shown). However, while d2d3 exhibited chlorata
whitening of emerging leaves (Figure 4A), the mutant
combinations including dcl4 did not. Nevertheless, all
dcl-mutant combinations showed knock-down of endogenous
ChlI mRNA levels (Figure 4B), which correlated with the
presence of viral ChlI siRNAs (Figure 4C). As expected
from our analysis of individual dcl-mutants, d2d3, d3d4 and
d2d4 accumulated single size classes of 21, 22 or 24 nt viral
siRNAs, respectively. Surprisingly, d2d3d4 still accumulated
residual 21 nt viral siRNAs (Figure 4C). Apparently, in the
absence of the other DCLs, DCL1 processes some CaLCuV
dsRNAs. Notably, longer bands of both sense and antisense
polarities, presumably viral dsRNA intermediates, were
detected in d2d3d4 (Figure 4C). In the case of some RNA
viruses, including Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) and Turnip
crinkle virus (TCV) but not Cucumber mosaic virus
(CMV), residual DCL1-derived viral sRNAs have been also
observed (30,31).
Taken together our results indicate that each DCL individu-
ally can mediate VIGS in infected tissues, which correlates
with predominant accumulation of a corresponding single
size-class of siRNA. Based on phenotypic observations for
a different endogenous VIGS marker gene and an RNA
virus TRV vector, Deleris et al. (30) concluded that, despite
the presence of TRV-derived 24 nt siRNAs, RNA-VIGS does
not occur in their Arabidopsis double mutant dcl2 dcl4. Our
DNA-VIGS results show that when DCL3-dependent 24 nt

viral siRNAs are the predominant species produced (i.e. in
our d2d4), knock-down of ChlI mRNA still occurs
(Figure 4B). This might illustrate a difference between
RNA-VIGS and DNA-VIGS phenomena. However, we can-
not formally exclude that trace amounts of DCL1-dependent
siRNAs produced in d2d4 (Figure 4C) also contribute to
DNA-VIGS, as they are capable of triggering ChlI mRNA
knock-down in the triple mutant d2d3d4 (Figure 4B and 4C).
Like for CaLCuV, the triple mutant d2d3d4 did not exhibit
increased susceptibility to CaMV compared to wt: symptom
development and viral DNA titers were comparable (data
not shown). Furthermore, d2d3d4 accumulated high levels
of 21 nt CaMV siRNAs (Figure 4D), confirming the key
role of DCL1 in their biogenesis.
CaMV interferes with dsRNA processing
In CaMV-infected wt plants, but not in CaLCuV-infected
plants, ladders of longer RNA bands were detected. We
observed this with viral and endogenous ta-siRNA probes
(Figure 5). The band patterns were similar for sense and anti-
sense polarities, revealing that they are likely dsRNA inter-
mediates processed from longer precursors. ta-siRNA255 is
generated from TAS 1a/b/c primary transcript(s) by
miR173-mediated cleavage followed by RDR6 catalyzed
second strand synthesis and DCL4 processing of the resulting
dsRNA (10–13). CaMV infection might hinder DCL4-
mediated processing of these precursors. Supporting this
idea, no siR255-specific bands were detected in CaMV-
infected rdr6, while their pattern changed in dcl4 but not in

other dcl mutants (Figure 5B and data not shown).
Consistent with impaired DCL4 processivity is the observed
involvement of DCL1 in producing 21 nt CaMV siRNAs
(Figure 3B).
The long antisense RNAs we detected for different regions
of the CaMV genome (Figure 5C) reflect a considerable
amount of antisense transcription of CaMV, which was not
yet appreciated. In contrast to the aforementioned TAS
precursors, accumulation of sense and antisense viral long
RNA was RDR6-independent (data not shown).
Silencing and its suppression during RNA tobamovirus
infection
To compare our results for nuclear DNA viruses with a
cytoplasmic RNA virus, we inoculated the Arabidopsis
silencing mutants with ORMV. None of the mutants tested
showed a dramatic difference in ORMV symptoms (data
not shown). However, 22 days post-inoculation, viral RNA
was significantly elevated in dcl4, d2d4 and d2d3d4 com-
pared to wt or other mutants that did not affect DCL4
(Figure 6A and C). In contrast to the DNA viruses, ORMV
siRNAs were predominantly of the 21 nt size class
(Figure 6B and D), which was abolished in dcl4, d2d4 and
d2d3d4, but not other mutants (Figure 6B and D). In dcl4,
22 nt siRNAs appeared, mostly of viral sense polarity
(Figure 6B), while in d2d4 a 24 nt siRNA signal was detected
(Figure 6D). In d2d3d4, nearly all siRNAs were abolished.
Thus, DCL4 is the major dicer generating ORMV siRNAs.
In its absence, DCL2 acts to generate 22 nt viral siRNAs,
and when both DCL4 and DCL2 are absent, DCL3 generates
24 nt viral siRNAs. This compensation effect was reflected in
viral long RNA titers, which were inversely correlated with
siRNAs levels in the respective dcl mutants. RDR2, RDR6
and HYL1 do not play a role in ORMV siRNA biogenesis
(Figure 6). Most recently, the primacy of DCL4 in produc-
ing viral siRNAs was demonstrated for infections with two
different RNA viruses (30,31).
We showed previously that viral and endogenous sRNAs
are sensitive to b-elimination in ORMV-infected wt plants
(19). This suggests that ORMV suppresses HEN1 activity.
Here we analyzed ORMV-infected silencing mutants, looking
for changes in accumulation and modification of viral
siRNAs, endogenous sRNAs (miRNA and ta-siRNA) and
their passenger strands (miRNA* and siRNA*). In contrast
to CaMV-, CaLCuV- and non-infected plants, miR173*
(21 nt) and siR255* (20 and 21 nt) species accumulated in
ORMV-infected plants (Figures 6C and Supplementary Fig-
ure S5). Using the b-elimination test comparing wt and
hen1-5 plants, we found that endogenous sRNA passenger (*)
strands, a fraction of corresponding sRNAs and most ORMV
siRNAs were not methylated (Supplementary Figure S5). We
conclude that unmethylated sRNA duplexes over-accumulate
in ORMV-infected cells.
Upon ORMV infection aberrant 20, 23 and 24 nt miR173
species accumulate (Figure 6C) and are sensitive to b-
elimination (Supplementary Figure S5). Moreover, miR173*
patterns resembled those of miR173, although they migrated
faster on the gel (Figure 6C). This observation fits the pre-
dicted 21 nt length of miR173* (one nt shorter than
miR173). Thus, ORMV infection phenocopies HEN1 defi-
ciency, where unmethylated miRNAs are subject to both par-
tial degradation and oligourydilation (21), although the latter
effect was not detectable for every type of sRNA (Figures 6C
and Supplementary Figure S5 and data not shown).

than sense strands due to their lower molecular weight (see Supplementary

DISCUSSION
Viral siRNA biogenesis varies between plant viruses
and is primarily determined by the DCL step
Our analysis of viral siRNAs in Arabidopsis RNA silencing
mutants shows that both gemini- and pararetro-viruses—
two families of nuclear DNA viruses—are targeted by all
four DCL activities. This process results in 21, 22 and
24 nt siRNA production from viral coding and non-coding
regions, but the relative contributions of DCL4 and DCL1
differ between CaLCuV and CaMV. In contrast, the cytoplas-
mic tobamovirus ORMV is primarily targeted by DCL4,
resulting in production of predominantly 21 nt viral siRNAs.
Thus, the three viruses are differentially targeted by subsets
of the four plant DCLs.
We observed no significant contribution of the plant RNA
polymerases RDR6, RDR2 or POL IVa to viral siRNA
biogenesis. Endogenous 21 nt ta-siRNA biogenesis requires

RDR6 to produce dsRNA for DCL4 and 24 nt ra-siRNA
biogenesis requires POL IVa and RDR2 to produce dsRNA
for DCL3 (4,15). The equivalent size-classes of viral siRNAs
accumulate in the same DCL-determined manner without
utilizing the upstream part of the endogenous pathways.
Taken together with the findings of Gasciolli et al. (11) and
Xie et al. (12), we conclude that Arabidopsis DCLs are
versatile size-specific enzymes, acting on many different
dsRNA substrates present in plant cells.
Our results do not exclude involvement of POL IVb (47),
or RDRs 1, 3a, 3b and 3c (8) in viral siRNA production.
However, POL IVb appears to be involved in maintaining
heterochromatin at certain genomic repeats rather than
ra-siRNA biogenesis (15,47). RDR1, although inducible by
RNA viruses, is not required for the biogenesis of siRNAs
derived from RNA viruses (30,48), the two DNA viruses
(our unpublished data) or any endogenous loci tested so far
(29). To date, there is no evidence that RDR3a/b/c have a
function.
The three size-classes of DNA viral siRNAs detected
here are probably produced from dsRNA rather than from
hairpin precursors, since sense and antisense strands accumu-
late for each size class. However, certain hairpin-like regions
of viral transcripts might be recognized as quasi-miRNA pre-
cursors by DCL1. Interestingly, two of the three CaMV
regions we probed (L1 and L2) are part of a 450 nt long,
branched stem–loop structure within the 35S RNA leader
(46). Whether plant DNA viruses, like some of their animal
counterparts (49,50), code for true miRNAs is still an open
question.
DCL1 can process viral dsRNA
Our results suggest that DCL1, thought to mainly process
hairpins in the miRNA pathway, also processes long
dsRNA. We observed 21 nt siRNAs from CaLCuV in the
triple mutant lacking DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4 (Figure 4C)
and DCL1-dependent processing of certain CaMV dsRNAs
to 21 nt siRNAs (Figure 3). For CaLCuV, DCL1-mediated
processing of viral dsRNA is inefficient, because presumed
intermediates accumulate in addition to 21 nt siRNAs in
infected d2d3d4 plants. We hypothesize that DCL1 evolved
to excise miRNA/miRNA* duplexes from hairpins, and
lacks the processivity required to efficiently digest long
dsRNA. Thus, one would expect DCL1 to be out-competed
by DCL4 for siRNA production.
As mentioned above, DCL1-dependent viral siRNAs are
not sufficient to mediate establishment of total DNA-VIGS
in newly emerging leaves. This distinction from DCL4
products may be functionally important, because miRNAs
produced by DCL1 are thought to act in a cell-autonomous
manner to regulate plant development. Since involvement
of DCL1 in endogenous siRNA production was recently
reported (51,52), it would be interesting to test whether all
such DCL1-dependent sRNAs act locally to the cells that
produce them.
Figure 7. Model for VIGS and anti-viral defense based on RNA silencing. Two adjoining plant cells are shown schematically. The initially infected cell (left)
contains high titers of DNA or RNA virus. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) arises from viral genomes independently of known silencing-related host RNA
polymerases. Arrows connecting dsRNA to DCL enzymes represent the relative contribution of each DCL to viral siRNA biogenesis. For the DNA virus, every
DCL digests the dsRNA into distinct size classes of siRNAs, with DCL3, DCL4 and DCL2 being favored (in that order). For RNA viruses, DCL4 is most
important, with DCL2 and DCL3 compensating DCL4-deficiency (e.g. due to mutation or viral suppression). The 21 nt DCL4 product is potentially the signal
required for VIGS spread. Both infectious nucleic acids and viral siRNAs move into the right-hand cell. However, the viral titer remains low, because DCL4 and
RDR6 amplify incoming siRNA signal and digest viral transcripts. In this manner, VIGS would spread into meristematic tissues from which viruses are normally
excluded. Viral siRNAs are stabilized by HEN1-mediated methylation.

dsRNA accumulation during DNA virus infection
While RNA viruses are obliged to produce sense and
antisense copies of their genome to replicate, only sense
transcripts are required for replication of DNA viruses. In
contrast to RNA viruses, DNA viruses do not encode an
RDR that could theoretically complement host deficiencies
for silencing-related RDRs. We show that both gemini- and
pararetrovirus infections give rise to sense and antisense tran-
scripts, which might form dsRNA precursors for viral
siRNAs. To account for their production without POL IV and
RDR activities we propose that POL II-driven transcription
on circular viral genomes could produce overlapping sense/
antisense transcripts. Indeed, bidirectional POL II promoters
in geminiviruses normally generate converging left- and
rightward transcripts (53,54). Thus, viral transcripts could
extend beyond their overlapping polyadenylation signals
prior to cleavage and polyadenylation. Degradation products
of read-through transcripts have been detected for the gemi-
niviral promoter region (54). No bi-directional transcription
has been reported for pararetroviruses, but we speculate that
the strong CaMV enhancer of the 35S and 19S RNA
promoters (55) can also drive POL II transcription in the
antisense direction. Bidirectional transcription driven by
the CaMV 35S core promoter was documented for a reporter
system in Arabidopsis (56).
Numerous recent reports indicate that large parts of animal
and plant genomes are transcribed in both orientations (57).
Although the biological significance of antisense transcription
is still unclear, it could serve as a genome surveillance
mechanism to silence endogenous DNA repeats and multiple
circular minichromosomes generated by DNA virus infection.
A specific role for DCL4 and RDR6 in virus induced
gene silencing
Using the CaLCuV::Chl vector, we demonstrate that
establishment and/or maintenance of extensive VIGS in
newly growing tissues requires DCL4, HEN1 and RDR6.
DCL1, DCL2 and DCL3 present in combinations or individu-
ally are sufficient to support VIGS-mediated knockdown of
ChlI transcript in the absence of DCL4, but not sufficient to
establish the indicative chlorata phenotype in newly emerging
leaves.
Our model to explain these observations (Figure 7) is that
DCL4-dependent 21 nt ChlI siRNAs of viral origin spread
into the shoot apical meristem, from which viruses are
normally excluded, to trigger ChlI silencing in newly formed
structures. Although Chl-VIGS in leaves formed before
inoculation is associated with accumulation of three size
classes of viral siRNAs, individual size classes are sufficient
for ChlI mRNA knock-down. Indeed, strong accumulation
of DCL2-dependent 22 nt siRNAs is correlated with reduced
ChlI transcript levels in the d3d4 mutant. Similar results were
obtained for DCL3-dependent 24 nt siRNA accumulation in
d2d4, and for DCL1-dependent 21 nt siRNA accumulation
in d2d3d4. Nonetheless, extensive VIGS did not occur in
emerging leaves of these mutant plants deficient in DCL4
activity. Therefore, we suggest that DCL4-dependent 21 nt
siRNAs are transported to the shoot apical meristem where
they act as primers for RDR6 coupled to DCL4 in a signal
amplification loop (Figure 7) and guide RISC-mediated
degradation of target mRNAs. Both processes would require
methylation of the 21 nt siRNAs mediated by HEN1. Alterna-
tively, DCL4 and RDR6 might act only in the meristem to
receive and amplify a silencing signal.
Dunoyer et al. (24) concluded that cell-to-cell spread of
silencing triggered by inverted-repeat transgenes requires
DCL4 and is correlated with the accumulation of 21 nt but
not 24 nt siRNAs. They proposed that primary 21 nt siRNAs
are short-range silencing signals and that long-range silencing
signals are secondary 21 nt siRNAs generated by RDR6-
mediated amplification. Our findings support this hypothesis,
extending it to the spread of VIGS. This would suggest a
mechanism for the exclusion of RNA viruses from the
shoot apical meristem. Earlier work established a role for
RDR6 in this exclusion (26).
Compensation between DCL4-, DCL3- and DCL2-
dependent viral siRNAs
The most abundant class of siRNAs derived from CaLCuV
and CaMV is 24 nt long. Knocking out DCL3 eliminated
24 nt viral siRNAs without affecting viral DNA levels
or VIGS. This is probably because DCL4 and DCL2 products
(21 and 22 nt siRNAs) can mediate RNAi-like silencing
in Arabidopsis (24,31). However, CaLCuV::Chl infec-
tion of the double mutant d2d4 still resulted in ChlI transcript
knock-down, although mainly 24 nt viral ChlI siRNAs
remained. Potentially, DCL3-dependent siRNAs are sufficient
to target transcripts for degradation. This idea is reinforced by
the higher accumulation of ORMV genomic RNA in d2d3d4
than in d2d4. Additionally, the 24 nt species might target the
ChlI genomic DNA coding region, resulting in transcriptional
silencing.
Our results implicate DCL2 in production of 22 nt viral
siRNAs. These species accumulate in wt but not dcl2 plants
infected with both DNA viruses studied here. Based on the
increased accumulation of DCL2-dependent 22 nt siRNA in
dcl3, dcl4 and d3d4, DCL2 appears to gain access to
substrates normally processed by others DCLs. An antiviral
role of DCL2 was suggested by Xie et al. (29) based on
increased susceptibility of dcl2 plants to the RNA carmovirus
TCV, which correlates with the absence of TCV-derived siR-
NAs at the early stage of infection. Nonetheless, infection
with RNA viruses including CMV, TuMV (29) and ORMV
(this study) did not result in differences of viral titers or
siRNA accumulation in dcl2 or other mutants, except dcl4
(this study). We did notice, however, that DCL2-dependent
22 nt ORMV siRNAs accumulate in dcl4.
Based on their analyses of RNA viruses, Deleris et al. (30)
and Bouche et al. (31) concluded that DCL4 plays a key role
in anti-viral defense and RNA-VIGS but, when DCL4 is
mutated or inhibited by viral suppression, DCL2 takes over
this role. Our results for the RNA tobamovirus confirm
such a hierarchical action of DCL4 and DCL2 and further
show that DCL3 can also limit viral RNA accumulation.
Viral strategies of silencing suppression
RNA viruses might circumvent complex DCL redundancies
by suppressing RNA silencing downstream, at the shared
HEN1 step. We show that ORMV infection interferes with
HEN1-mediated methylation of viral siRNAs and endogenous

sRNAs, including miRNAs and ta-siRNAs, but not 24 nt
ra-siRNAs [this work and (19)]. Furthermore, miRNA*
and ta-siRNA* strands over-accumulate during ORMV
infection. The tobamovirus factor responsible for interference
with HEN1 remains to be identified. Mechanistically, one
of the viral proteins might bind sRNA duplexes, as was
demonstrated for several viral suppressors (35,36), or inacti-
vate HEN1 directly through a protein-protein interaction.
Unmethylated sRNA duplexes appear to undergo partial
degradation at their 2 nt overhangs that results in accumula-
tion of shorter-sized sRNAs of both viral and endogenous
origin. Additionally, they are also subject to 30-end oligo-
uridylation observed at least for the miR173/miR173* duplex
(Figure 6C). In both cases, assembly of RISC and the spread
of silencing might be compromised. The proposed RISC
assembly defect is supported by Baumberger and Baulcombe
(7) who found that siRNAs derived from three RNA viruses
(including another tobamovirus) are not associated with the
RISC slicer component AGO1. It would be interesting to
test whether other viruses from the AGO1 study interfere
with HEN1.
When expressed as transgenes in Arabidopsis, silencing
suppressors including potyviral HC-Pro, tombusviral p19
and closteroviral p21, known to bind miRNA and siRNA
duplexes in vitro (35), increase accumulation of miRNA*
strands (38) and prevent miRNA methylation by HEN1
(58). If these suppressors also interfere with HEN1 activity
during viral infection, then targeting HEN1 would be a
general silencing suppression strategy.
Additionally, our results suggest that the pararetrovirus
CaMV has evolved a suppressor that stabilizes dsRNA prod-
ucts of RDR6. Indeed, several abundant long dsRNA precur-
sors of ta-siRNAs accumulate in CaMV-infected plants.
Potentially, the putative suppressor impairs the processing
of these long dsRNAs by DCL4. Suppression of DCL4 in
CaMV-infected tissues would be consistent with our result
that the major fraction of 21 nt CaMV siRNAs depends on
DCL1; during CaLCuV and ORMV infection, DCL4 per-
forms this function instead. No silencing suppressor encoded
by plant pararetroviruses has been reported so far. Our find-
ings provide the basis for identifying this factor and for using
CaMV as a tool to study ta-siRNA biogenesis.
The silencing suppression strategies we propose for CaMV
and ORMV do not appear to be exploited by CaLCuV.
DCL4- and HEN1-dependent production of methylated
21 nt viral siRNAs is not impaired in CaLCuV infected Ara-
bidopsis. Geminiviruses encode at least two types of silencing
suppressor proteins, AC2 and AC4 (59,60). The latter specif-
ically binds single-stranded 21 nt sRNA in vitro and miRNA
in vivo (60). Since VIGS initiated by CaLCuV::Chl spreads
efficiently into emerging leaves via the action of DCL4,
HEN1 and RDR6, geminivirus suppressors of silencing
might act downstream of methylated 21 nt siRNA production.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
By testing a similar panel of Arabidopsis mutants as used
in Deleris et al. (30) and Bouche et al. (31) for three RNA
viruses, we found that two DNA viruses trigger essentially
the same battery of siRNA responses as RNA viruses.
A notable difference, however, is that DNA virus infection
results in a strong accumulation of DCL3-dependent 24 nt
siRNAs, irrespective of the viral region probed. In contrast,
the equivalent size-class of RNA virus-derived species is
detectable only in mutants lacking DCL4 and DCL2 (30,
31 and this work, for ORMV), with the exception of a recom-
binant RNA virus TRV, which produced 24 nt species in wild
type plants (30). This distinction probably reflects the funda-
mentally different lifecycle of DNA viruses, which includes a
nuclear phase.
Furthermore, our work demonstrates that all four DCL
activities produce specific size-classes of DNA virus-derived
siRNAs that contribute to the targeting of homologous ChlI
mRNA to varying degrees. Surprisingly, mutations in
silencing-related genes did not result in hypersusceptibility
to ORMV or DNA virus infection. This is in contrast to the
work of Bouche et al., who reported enhanced symptoms in
CMV-infected plants of their triple mutant dcl2 dcl3 dcl4
line (31). We conclude that DCL pathway redundancies, as
well as viral suppression of silencing in wt plants, hide
broader deficiency phenotypes for infection with the viruses
used in our study.
