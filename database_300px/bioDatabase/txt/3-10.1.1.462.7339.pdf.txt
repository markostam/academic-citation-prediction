To improve the probability of detecting unintended side effects during maize gene manipulations by
bombardment, proteomics was used as an analytical tool complementary to the existing safety
assessment techniques. Since seed proteome is highly dynamic, depending on the species variability
and environmental influence, we analyzed the proteomic profiles of one transgenic maize variety (event
MON 810) in two subsequent generations (T05 and T06) with their respective isogenic controls (WT05
and WT06). Thus, by comparing the proteomic profiles of WT05 with WT06 we could determine the
environmental effects, while the comparison between WT06 and T06 seeds from plants grown under
controlled conditions enabled us to investigate the effects of DNAmanipulation. Finally, by comparison
of T05 with T06 seed proteomes, it was possible to get some indications about similarities and
differences between the adaptations of transgenic and isogenic plants to the same strictly controlled
growth environment. Approximately 100 total proteins resulted differentially modulated in the
expression level as a consequence of the environmental influence (WT06 vs WT05), whereas 43 proteins
resulted up- or down-regulated in transgenic seeds with respect to their controls (T06 vs WT06), which
could be specifically related to the insertion of a single gene into a maize genome by particle
bombardment. Transgenic seeds responded differentially to the same environment as compared to
their respective isogenic controls, as a result of the genome rearrangement derived from gene insertion.
To conclude, an exhaustive differential proteomic analysis allows to determine similarities and
differences between traditional food and new products (substantial equivalence), and a case-by-case
assessment of the new food should be carried out in order to have a wide knowledge of its features.

Introduction
The introduction of exogenous DNA sequences into the plant
genome for GMO production is commercially carried out by
either Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (i.e., infecting
plant cells with a disarmed pathogenic organism like Agrobac-
terium tumefaciens containing the transgene) or particle bom-
bardment (i.e., bombardment of cells with metal particles
carrying the transgene). In both cases, the process is random,
leading to physical disruption in the genome (e.g., insertional
mutation) or gene regulation (pleiotropic effect) and possible
inactivation of endogenous genes.1 Activation of silent genes
and formation of fusion proteins by transcriptional read-
through processes are also possible,2 although these may be
in part minimized during the process of transgenic product
development.3 In addition, the transcriptional products of the
introduced gene(s) (and possibly the modified biochemical
pathway based on them) may interact with the regulation of
other genes or biochemical pathways. A major concern is the
possible occurrence of unintended effects caused, for example,
by the site of transgene integration (e.g., interruption of
important open reading frames or regulatory sequences), which
could result in modified metabolism, novel fusion proteins, or
other pleiotropic effects that could compromise the product
safety.4,5 This includes the production of new allergens or
toxins. Thus, although people has been consuming genetically
modified (GM) crops for many years, there is interest in
assessing their safety with the aim of addressing both the
intended and the unintended toxic or nutritionally harmful side
effects resulting from the cultivation and consumption of
products from GM crops.6,7
The comparison between GM and non-GM crops usually
comprises agronomic/phenotypic features, feed performance
studies and crop composition. Molecular profiling may facilitate
a more complete, holistic comparative analysis. This approach
involves several technologies, like DNA microarrays, proteom-
ics, mRNA profiling and metabolomic profiling, which are now
available as complementary tools for the safety assessment of

GM crops.4,8 The combination of these nontargeted approaches
is considered to facilitate a more comprehensive approach than
the targeted methods and, thus, to provide additional op-
portunities for identifying unintended effects.
The proteome is the entire complement of a genome and
the result of genetic expression, ribosomal synthesis, and
proteolytic degradation.9 Proteins are of special interest for the
safety assessment because they could be toxins (e.g., phyto-
hemagglutinin), antinutrients (e.g., protease inhibitors) and
allergens, or they may be involved in their synthesis. Moreover,
contrary to the genome, which is constant for an organism,
the proteome is highly dynamic and depends on cell cycle,
environmental influences, and tissue/cell type. Nevertheless it
is the direct product of genome transcription and translation;
therefore, if a genetic modification affects the genome of a plant
by changing its metabolic pathways or producing new proteins,
the resulting proteome will be altered. Thus, side by side to
genomic, trascriptomic and metabolomic analysis of GM crops,
a proteomic investigation represents a valuable analytical tool
complementary to the existing safety assessment techniques,10
improving the probability of detecting unintended side effects.
The present study addresses the feasibility of proteomics in
identifying unintended or intended changes in commercial GM
maize caused by genetic engineering by comparing the trans-
genic seed proteome with the wild-type line. Moreover, since
it is well-known that gene expression, and consequently the
seed proteome, may be influenced by environmental condi-
tions and variety, we have discriminated the recombinant DNA
effects from those related to the environment by cross-
comparisons between two consecutive generations of one
stabilized transgenic maize line with their isogenic controls
(WT06 vs WT05; T06 vs T05; T05 vs WT05; T06 vs WT06).
So far, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) combined
with mass spectrometry (MS) is still the most widely used
approach for comparing plant proteomes in the attempt to
identify differentially expressed proteins;11 thus, it was used
in the present study. Our aim was to achieve a better under-
standing of the side effects generated by a single gene insertion
(in this case, the sequence coding for the endotoxin CryIA(b)
of Bacillus thuringiensis, Bt) on the expression profile of all the
grain proteins, that is, to verify whether also nonspecific
alterations of the maize genome can occur upon transforma-
tion. The Bt toxin is a protein toxic to insect pests, produced
by the soil bacterium B. thuringiensis, which is transferred to
plants to confer the ability to produce the insect toxin by its
own. Some Bt maize varieties produce Bt toxin mainly inside
the stalk, some mostly in the roots, while others express it in
all parts of the plant. Thus, the GM maize seed proteome is of
particular interest, because it is an important source for
nutrients and, therefore, an essential part of the human diet.
Material and Methods
Chemicals and Samples. All the chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Acrylamide/Bis solution (40%, 37.5:1), the
Versa Doc Imaging System (model 3000) and the 17-cm long
nonlinear immobilized pH gradients (IPG) 3–10 were obtained
from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Glycine, sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea, thiourea, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)
phosphine (TCEP), 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide and CHAPS were
from Fluka. Bromophenol blue, carrier ampholytes, and agarose
were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden).
HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN) (Merck), Milli-Q water (Milli-
pore, Bedford, MA), and formic acid (FA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
were used for the preparation of mobile phases.
Seed Collection and Plant Growth. The samples of maize
seed used in this study were derived from the transgenic
commercial Bt hybrid line 33P67 (event MON810 from Pioneer
Hi-Bred International, Inc., Johnston, IA) and its respective
control isoline 33P66. For our investigation, two subsequent
generations of both lines were employed (i.e., WT05, WT06,
where WT stands for “wild-type” and T05, T06 where T
indicates “transgenic”). Commercial seeds (WT05, T05) were
provided by Pioneer-Hi Bred Spain SL in 2005, whereas plants
derived from the WT05 and T05 seeds were grown in Italy in
2006 side-by-side in environmentally controlled growth cham-
bers, adjacent but separated, in order to obtain WT06 and T06
grains influenced by the same environmental effects. Plants
were cultivated at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity with 14 h
of light (50–100 µmol m-2 s-1). It is important to note that the
stability of the genome is guaranteed by the producer Company
through multiple generations of crossing; therefore, the two
subsequent generations here used presented uniformity in
genotype.
Protein Extraction and Sample Preparation for 2D Elec-
trophoresis. To reduce the biological variance and obtain an
“average” sample, grains harvested from eight randomly se-
lected maize plants for control (WT05, WT06) and transgenic
(T05, T06) lines were pooled and ground with liquid nitrogen
in a mortar. Afterward, protein extraction was carried out
according to either Damerval et al.12 or Mechin et al.13 In the
first case, an acetone solution containing 10% trichloroacetic
acid and 0.07% -mercaptoethanol was used (V (mL)/w (g) )
3.33), while the second extraction procedure was based on a
strongly solubilizing mixture (R2D2 buffer) containing chao-
tropes (5 M urea and 2 M thiourea), detergents (2% CHAPS
and 2% SB3–10), reducing agents (20 mM DTT and 5 mM
TCEP) and 0.5% Ampholine pH 3–10. Moreover, direct solu-
bilization with the typical “lysis buffer” for IEF containing 7 M
urea, 2 M thiourea, 3% CHAPS, 0.5% Ampholine pH 3–10 and
5 mM TCEP was used. With the Damerval’s procedure, 0.3 g
of flour were dissolved in 1 mL of extraction buffer, while with
both R2D2 and lysis buffer, the buffer volume to sample weight
ratio was approximately 30 mL/g. Protein extraction was
performed by vortexing for 1 h at room temperature; after that,
the mixtures were centrifuged (20 000g at room temperature)
and the supernatants were recovered. In the case of Damerval’s
method, proteins were allowed to precipitate for 1 h at –20 °C;
after that, they were centrifuged at 20 000g for 15 min at 4 °C.
The pellet was washed twice with cold acetone containing
0.07% -mercaptoethanol, and afterward, it was solubilized
either in R2D2 buffer or lysis buffer (final buffer volume to flour
weight ratio was approximately 30 mL/g), which are compatible
with the subsequent IEF analytical step. Therefore, four dif-
ferent protein extraction procedures were assessed: (i) Damer-
val’s protocol + solubilization in R2D2 buffer; (ii) Damerval’s
protocol+ solubilization in lysis buffer; (iii) direct solubilization
in R2D2 buffer; and (iv) direct solubilization in lysis buffer. At
the end of protein solubilization, each sample was subjected
to reduction and alkylation with 5 mM fresh TCEP and 150 mM
2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, after which protein concentrations
were determined by means of the RC-DC Protein Assay (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA).
2D-Electrophoresis Conditions. Four large-size maps (18 ×
20 cm) were prepared for both control and transgenic maize
lines, using 17-cm long nonlinear IPGs pH 3–10. Approximately

800 µg of total proteins dissolved in 400 µL was loaded on each
strip by active in-gel rehydration: the strips were allowed to
rehydrate for 1 h in the separation vessel, after which a
potential of 100 V was applied for 7 h. At the end of the
rehydration step, the focusing process started immediately,
with a linear voltage ramp up to 1000 V in 5 h, followed by 5 h
at 1000 V constant, a new ramp from 1000 to 10 000 V in 1 h,
and finally 10 000 V constant until reaching a total product of
80 000 Vh. Subsequently, the strips were immediately equili-
brated for 25 min in slow agitation with a Tris-HCl solution
(192 mM), pH 8.8, containing 2% SDS, 20% glycerol and 6 M
urea. The strips were then attached to the top of the second-
dimension gels by means of 0.5% agarose melted in cathode
buffer (0.1% SDS in Tris-Glycine, pH 8.3). The second dimen-
sion was performed on Tris-HCl 8–18% T gradient polyacry-
lamide gels by applying the following current program: 5 mA/
gel for 1 h, 10 mA/gel for 13 h and 20 mA/gel until the dye
front (bromophenol blue added in the agarose solution)
reached the bottom end of the gel. Finally, the proteins were
revealed by Sypro Ruby staining after 1-h protein fixation in a
solution made of 40%methanol, 7% acetic acid and 53% water.
Destaining was performed with the same fixing solution for 1 h
followed by 3 h in water. Image digitization was carried out
with the Versa-Doc imaging system model 3000 (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA).
Gel Analysis. To have statistically significant data, four
replica maps were prepared for each sample. Cross-compari-
sons among the different samples were performed using the
software PDQuest version 8.0 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Statistic
analysis was performed with the Student’s t test (99% confi-
dence interval), while only 2-fold or higher quantitative varia-
tions were taken into consideration for further analyses.
Protein Categorization. Gene Ontology (GO) lists were
downloaded from TAIR Web site (http://www.arabidopsis.org/
tools/bulk/go/index.jsp): each protein was classified with
respect to its cellular component, biological process, and
molecular function using GO annotation. When no GO an-
notation was available, proteins were annotated manually
based on literature searches and closely related homologues.
In-Gel Digestion. Significantly modulated (2-fold or more)
protein spots were carefully cut out from Sypro Ruby stained
gels and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion according to
Shevchenko and colleagues14 with minor modifications. The
gel pieces were swollen in a digestion buffer containing 50 mM
NH4HCO3 and 12.5 ng/µL of trypsin (modified porcine trypsin,
sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI) in an ice bath. After
30 min, the supernatant was removed and discarded, 20 µL of
50 mM NH4HCO3 was added to the gel pieces, and digestion
was allowed to proceed at 37 °C overnight. The supernatant
containing tryptic peptides was dried by vacuum centrifugation.
Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, the peptide mixtures were
redissolved in 10 µL of 5% FA (Formic Acid).
Protein Identification by MS/MS. Peptide mixtures were
separated using a nanoflow-HPLC system (Ultimate; Switchos;
Famos; LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). A sample
volume of 10 µL was loaded by the autosampler onto a
homemade 2 cm fused silica precolumn (75 µm i.d.; 375 µm
o.d.; Reprosil C18-AQ, 3 µm (Ammerbuch-Entringen, DE)) at a
flow rate of 2 µL/min. Sequential elution of peptides was
accomplished using a flow rate of 200 nL/min and a linear
gradient from solution A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid)
to 50% of solution B (98% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid)
in 40 min over the precolumn in-line with a homemade 10–15
cm resolving column (75 µm i.d.; 375 µm o.d.; Reprosil C18-
AQ, 3 µm (Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany)).
Peptides were eluted directly into a High Capacity ion Trap
(model HCTplus, Bruker-Daltonik, Germany). Capillary voltage
was 1.5–2 kV and a dry gas flow rate of 10 L/min was used
with a temperature of 230 °C. The scan range used was from
300 to 1800 m/z. Protein identification was performed by
searching in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
nonredundant database (NCBInr) using the Mascot program
(http://www.matrixscience.com). The following parameters
were adopted for database searches: complete carbamidom-
ethylation of cysteines and partial oxidation of methionines,
peptide mass tolerance (1.2 Da, fragment mass tolerance (0.9
Da, missed cleavages 2. For positive identification, the score
of the result of (-10 Log(P)) had to be over the significance
threshold level (P < 0.05).
Even though high MASCOT scores are obtained with values
greater than 60, when proteins were identified with only one
peptide, a combination of automated database search and
manual interpretation of peptide fragmentation spectra was
used to validate protein assignments. In this manual verifica-
tion, the mass error, the presence of fragment ion series, and
the expected prevalence of C-terminus containing (Y-type ions)
in the high mass range were all taken into account. Moreover,
replicate measurements have confirmed the identity of these
protein hits.
Results
In our investigation, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(2DE) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) was used as a
profiling technique in order to detect new protein products
generated during nonspecific gene insertion into maize seeds
by particle bombardment. One GM (event MON 810) maize
seed variety 33P67, commonly used in animal feed, was
subjected to comparative seed proteome analysis using the
isogenic line 33P66 as reference. By Southern blotting, only one
copy of the exogenous gene was found in the examined
transgenic seeds (data not shown), confirming that transgenic
and its relative isogenic control differed only in the presence
of the transgene, as also assessed by the producer Company.
Since an important factor to be taken into account when
evaluating the unintended effects of genetic modification is the
natural variability existing among maize species15 and the
environmental influence, we started comparing the proteomic
profiles of the same variety (isogenic control) in its WT05
generation (WT05 seeds) and WT06 progenies. This enabled
us to eliminate any variation related to maize variety and to
determine and quantify the environmental effect on seed
proteomic profiles. On the other hand, any difference detect-
able in the protein expression levels between WT06 and T06
seeds, originating from plants grown side-by-side in an envi-
ronmentally controlled growth chamber, can be strictly related
to the genome alteration as a consequence of particle bom-
bardment. Finally, by means of two parallel comparisons
between T05 versus T06 proteomes and WT05 versus WT06
proteomes, it was also possible to evaluate how transgenic
plants, showing a rearranged genome as a result of the insertion
of only one extra gene, responded in different ways to the same
environmental conditions with respect to their isogenic con-
trols. In Figure 1, a scheme of the workflow is shown.
For generating high-quality 2D maps, different protein
extraction methods were tested: (i) direct extraction using R2D2
buffer; (ii) direct extraction using lysis buffer; (iii) the extraction

proposed by Damerval et al.12 followed by solubilization in
R2D2; and (iv) the extraction described by Damerval followed
by solubilization in lysis buffer. All the protein extracts obtained
with the four different protocols were assayed for protein
concentrations and four small-size maps were created by
loading equal amounts of protein (non linear IPGs pH 3–10,
8–18% T polyacrylamide gels). As no appreciable differences
could be observed among the four procedures in terms of map
quality (results not shown), direct solubilization in IEF buffer
was chosen for the analysis, in the attempt to keep the
extraction protocol as simple as possible and prevent possible
sample loss and/or artifacts occurrence due to excessive
manipulations.
Environmental Effects: Comparison of the Parental Lines
(WT05 and T05) with Their Own Progenies (WT06 and T06,
Respectively). We started by comparing the proteomic profiles
of WT05 seeds with WT06 progenies coming from plants grown
in different locations. In fact, in this event, there are no
differences in the genome and the differential spots can be
related to the environmental influence. This is also the case of
T05 line and its progeny T06, as the two generations present
the same genomic set but were grown under different envi-
ronmental conditions. Figure 2 shows two representative maps
of the samples WT05 and WT06, while Figure 3 displays two
maps concerning the samples T05 and T06, with the differen-
tially expressed spots highlighted with symbols and standard
spot protein (SSP) numbers. Some gel regions are zoomed and
displayed next to the principal images. It can be appreciated
that there are both qualitative (newly induced or totally
repressed spots) and quantitative (increased or decreased by
at least 2-fold) changes caused by the different environments
used to grow the two organisms. As concerns the couple of
samples WT05/WT06, PDQuest analysis revealed that a total
of 100 spots (about 30% of the total matched across all the
replica 2D maps) presented significantly different expression
levels in WT06 as compared to WT05. In particular, 38 spots
were found to be down-regulated (i.e,, WT06 to WT05 ratio
<0.5), 19 were up-regulated (ratio >2), 26 were newly ex-
pressed, while 17 were completely repressed. In the case of the
transgenic samples (T05/T06), a total of 78 spots resulted to
be differentially expressed, with 14 spots newly induced, 14
spots totally repressed, 23 spots up-regulated and 27 spots
down-regulated in the sample T06 with respect to T05. Each
of these comparisons, by itself, reveals the effects of the growth
environment on the seed protein composition, as the two
organisms that gave WT05 and WT06 seeds were grown in
different places. But if we analyze the results of the two
comparisons, we observe how two different genomes respond
to the same environmental condition (WT06 and T06 were
collected from plants grown in the same strictly controlled
conditions), but starting from different initial circumstances
chosen as references (WT05 and T05 seeds were collected from
plants grown in different environments). Thus, what we
observed is the combined effect of genome and environment
on the final seed proteomes. This explains why the two groups
of differentially expressed spots present such relevant differ-
ences (see Figures 2 and 3). Nevertheless, various protein spots
result to be in common to the two groups, and in particular
there are 4 commonly induced spots both in WT06 and T06
with respect to their parents (out of 26 and 14 total newly
expressed spots in WT06 and T06, respectively), 3 commonly
repressed spots (out of 17 and 14), 3 spots positively modulated
(out of 19 and 23) and 12 spots down-regulated (out of 38 and
27). Thus, although a proper comparison between the two
experiments cannot be done due to the presence of excessive
variables, it is possible to conclude that the environment has
a strong effect on seed protein profiles, thus leading to some
common features in two organisms with different genomic sets
and that start from different conditions.
Combined Effects of Genetic Manipulation and Enviro-
nment: Comparison of WT05 and T05 Seed Proteomes. AsWT05
and T05 seeds were collected from plants grown in slightly
different environmental conditions, one should expect that
possible differences in protein profiles were due to the com-
bined action of environment and genome. However, the
combination of the two factors would not necessarily lead to
the arithmetic sum of the differences caused by the single
factors, because each protein could be modulated either in
accordance (thus resulting in a difference major than those
caused by the single factors) or in opposite ways (thus possibly
nullifying the single effects) by the environmental and genomic
factors. In this case, in fact, only 27 protein spots resulted to
be differentially expressed in T05 with respect to WT05, with 7
spots newly induced, 6 spots positively modulated, 3 spots
repressed and 11 spots down-regulated. The fact that so little
differences occur between these two samples with respect to
the previous comparisons (100 and 78 differentially expressed
protein spots in WT06 vs WT05 and T06 vs T05, respectively)
might be explained by hypothesizing moderate effects of the
gene insertion procedure and of the slightly different growth
environments on the final seed proteome. If this was true or,
to be more precise, if the growth environment had an effect
on the seed proteome much greater than that of single gene
insertion by particle bombardment, by comparing T06 and
WT06 seeds, we should observe the effects of the sole genetic
manipulation, that should affect a limited number of proteins
as compared to those modulated by great environmental
changes.
Effects of Single Gene Insertion on Total Protein Profile:
Comparison of WT06 and T06 Seeds. To detect only unin-
tended side effects introduced during maize gene manipula-
tions, the two ecotypes WT05 and T05 were grown side-by-
side in an environmentally controlled growth chamber (but in
physically separated spaces, so as to prevent cross-pollination),
after which their seeds (WT06 and T06) were collected and
studied. In this way, the resulting differences in proteomic
profile should reflect the effects of DNA manipulation only,
since the influence of variety and environment would be
eliminated.

Figure 4 shows the two maps concerning the samples WT06
and T06. It can be seen that there are some clear qualitative
and quantitative differences, although they are much less than
those observed in the comparisons concerning the environ-
mental effects. On the other hand, the number of modulated
spots is similar to that found in the previous comparison
between the two parental lines. This seems to confirm the
hypothesis that the environment affects protein expression
more than gene manipulation by particle bombardment (in
terms of total number of protein spots affected). However, it
is also evident that the insertion of a single gene does not result
in a unique newly expressed protein, but rather in many
differently expressed genes with respect to the control. This
could be due to the fact that, when the transgene enters the
nucleus, many genetic loci are randomly affected by the
insertion procedure. In our specific case, the transformation
event resulted in a total of 43 differently expressed protein spots
in T06 with respect to WT06. In particular, 14 spots were found
to be down-regulated (i.e., T06 to WT06 ratio <0.5), 13 were
up-regulated (ratio >2), 7 were newly expressed while 9 were
completely repressed in the transgenic line. The spots of
interest appear to be scattered in the entire map, with no
particular restriction of molecular mass and isoelectric point.
Although the particular identities of such proteins should not
be of great importance in understanding or discussing the
phenomenon here presented, given that changes in the expres-
sion levels should be totally accidental, nevertheless, some of
the spots were cut out of the gel, digested with trypsin and

analyzed by internal peptide sequencing, using mainly RP-
HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. In Table 1 the identities of the successfully
identified proteins are listed, together with the standard spot
protein number (SSP), the identification parameters, and the
indication of their GO annotation (cellular component, biologi-
cal process, and molecular function). Moreover, a supplemental
table with peptide sequences is provided in the Supporting
Information.
Interestingly, a newly expressed spot (SSP 6711) correspond-
ing to 50 kDa gamma zein, a well-known allergenic protein,16
has been detected. Moreover, as a major concern, a number
of seed storage proteins (such as globulins and vicilin-like
embryo storage proteins) exhibited truncated forms having
molecular masses significantly lower than the native ones (e.g.,
SSP 7307, 2313, 8112, 1405, 2407, 5112, 2311, 5226, see Table
1). In agreement wit our data, Anderson et al.,17 when analyzing
various wheat lines, found that mass modifications occurred
in the major storage proteins of wheat, even though less
frequently than charge modifications. In our study, more
vertical than horizontal position shifts were observed. A pos-
sible explanation for this observation may be that mutations
leading to protein molecular mass changes are more frequent
or that vertical position shifts are easier to detect than
horizontal position shifts due to a higher resolution power in
this direction.
Finally, neither new nor chimeric proteins have been re-
vealed, as well as none of the protein products deriving from
the marker gene inserted (Bt toxin) could be identified in our
Figure 3. Comparison of T05 and T06 seed proteomes by 2-DE. The image displays two representative maps of T05 and T06 samples
out of a total of 8 maps. Significantly modulated spots in T06 as compared to T05 are indicated by symbols: triangles, induced in T06;
squares, repressed in T06; crosses, up-regulated in T06; ovals, down-regulated in T06. Dotted squares in the principal images indicate
zoomed regions displayed on the right (examples of spots induced, repressed and positively or negatively modulated). Nonlinear IPGs
pH 3–10 and 8–18% T polyacrylamide gels, for the first and second dimension, respectively, were used.

2D gels. It is presumed that the expression of the marker genes
is below the limit of detection (LOD) of the method here
employed. The same was observed by Corpillo and co-work-
ers,18 who were only able to detect the product of their marker
gene (nptII) by highly sensitive immuno-detection.
Discussion
The increasing presence of transgenic plant derivatives in a
wide range of animal and human consumables has provoked
in western Europe a strong demand for appropriate detection
methods to evaluate the existence of transgenic elements. Up
to now, despite the fact that confidence in the safety and
reliability of crop species depends significantly on their genetic
integrity, the frequency of transformation-induced mutations
and their importance as potential biohazards are poorly
understood. In the attempt to increase the chance of detecting
unintended effects deriving from transformation events, profil-
ing techniques such as proteomics are currently tested as
analytical tools complementary to the existing safety assess-
ment methods. Several studies have demonstrated the capacity
of 2-DE of characterizing and distinguishing varieties and
genotypes and even of identifying single mutations with
multiple effects (for reviews, see refs 19 and 20). Proteomics
has also the potential of precisely quantifying the possible
allergens present in a sample, and of detecting possible post-
translational modifications.
Figure 4. Comparison of WT06 and T06 seed proteomes by 2-DE. The image displays two representative maps of WT06 and T06
samples out of a total of 8 maps. Significantly modulated spots in T06 as compared to WT06 are indicated by symbols: triangles,
induced in T06; squares, repressed in T06; crosses, up-regulated in T06; ovals, down-regulated in T06. Dotted squares in the principal
images indicate zoomed regions displayed on the right (examples of spots induced, repressed and positively or negatively modulated).
SSP numbers refer to proteins listed in Table 1. Nonlinear IPGs pH 3–10 and 8–18% T polyacrylamide gels, for the first and second
dimension, respectively, were used.

1858 Journal of Proteome Research • Vol. 7, No. 5, 2008
In our investigation, transgenic maize seeds (T05) and their
isogenic controls (WT05) were grown side-by-side in an
environmentally controlled chamber and new seeds from these
plants, transgenic (T06) and relative controls (WT06), were
harvested. Thus, by cross-comparing the proteomic profiles of
these seeds, we were able to eliminate the natural variability
existing among maize species as well as the environmental
effects and, therefore, to determine in an unequivocal way the
possible effects related to genome modification as a conse-
quence of particle bombardment. Clearly the differentially
regulated proteins identified in the examined transgenic seeds
are specifically related to that sample, considering that particle
bombardment affects the seed genome randomly, thus making
accurate case by case assessments highly desirable. Data
revealed that the environment affects protein expression (in
terms of total number of protein spots) more than gene
manipulation by particle bombardment. Moreover, transgenic
plants reacted differentially to the same environmental condi-
tions compared to their isogenic counterpart, supporting the
hypothesis that they had a strongly rearranged genome after
particle bombardment.
The fact that quite a high number of protein spots was found
to be significantly modulated in the examined transgenic line
with respect to the parental one is in contrast with the data
collected by other researchers, who reported that only a few
proteins had been affected by the genetic manipulation, and
where the process of transformation did not seem to cause
insertional or pleiotropic changes into the seed proteome.18,21
In these studies, differences in spot quantity between trans-
genic and nontransgenic lines fell in the range of natural
variation or were part of the intended effects. They did not find
any protein changes due to genetic modification either. In our
opinion, the discrepancy may be attributed partly to the fact
that, in those cases, genome transformation was performed by
Agrobacterium instead of by particle bombardment, which is
a more “destructive” technique, partly to sample preparation.
The former explanation agrees with what expected: while with
A. tumefaciens, the insertion sites tend to have simpler struc-
tures, but with extensive chromosomal rearrangements, with
the particle bombardment approach, the variability seems to
be associated with deletion and extensive scrambling of
inserted and chromosomal DNA.22 The clearest evidence
implicating A. tumefaciens infection as a mutagenic event
comes from large-scale T-DNA tagging experiments,23,24 while
it is not known yet whether particle bombardment results in
chromosomal mutations, and those introduced at other ran-
dom locations, commonly called genome wide mutations. In
agreement with these observations, the experimental results
reported by Arencibia et al.25 and by Bao et al.26 indicated that
transgenic rice produced by A. tumefaciens treatment is
characterized by fewer genomic changes than those produced
with particle bombardment or cell electroporation. In this
regard, so far only a handful of studies has provided detailed
data on the chromosomal mutations resulting from particle
bombardment insertion,27–30 but no large-scale study had been
conducted on the transgene insertion patterns obtained with
particle bombardment. However, it appears that transgene
integration resulting from such a technique is usually ac-
companied by substantial disruption of the plant DNA and by
the insertion of superfluous DNA (bacterial chromosomal DNA
adjacent to a transgene and/or sequences close to the func-
tional gene sequence).22 Associated rearrangements can inter-
fere with the expression of genes containing homologous or
similar sequences.31,32 A naturally occurring instance of this
phenomenon has been reported for the nontransgenic rice low-
glutelin-content mutation, where a deletion resulted in the
transcription of a neighboring member of the glutelin gene
family, but was thought to have caused the silencing of the
entire gene family.33
In our investigation, a significant number of proteins were
differentially regulated both by environment and by insertion
of a new gene, allowing one to suppose that, when differences
in spot quantity between transgenic and nontransgenic lines
fell in the range of natural variation, that could be due to a
poor 2D map quality or specifically related to the introduced
gene. Interestingly, MS/MS identification of modulated spots
revealed that the proteins involved belong to several different
functional categories, but no new or chimeric proteins unique
to individual GM lines were observed. Similar results have been
reported for transgenic rice plants (O. sativa), where artificially
induced ectopic overexpression of a single gene (YK1) in rice
cells affected the expression of unrelated proteins and me-
tabolites,34 whereas in another transgenic rice, a considerable
fraction of the storage proteins turned out to be strongly under-
expressed (or even completely silenced).35 As concerns these
proteins, our findings demonstrated the natural presence of
truncated forms although their expression levels appeared to
be largely modulated after gene introduction. Since a cocktail
of protease inhibitors was used during protein extraction, the
phenomenon cannot be attributed to proteolytic activity,
whereas it is well-known that naturally occurring gene muta-
tions could affect the net charge (isoelectric point) and/or
molecular mass of the resulting protein and, therefore, the
protein pattern in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). A
point mutation (base-pair substitution) of the DNA, for ex-
ample, can result in (i) missense mutation,36 (ii) nonsense
mutation leading to protein elongation or truncation, (iii) loss
of phosphorylation or glycosylation sites, and (iv) alteration of
the degradation stability of the resulting protein. Although
further investigations are needed, quantitative variations here
detected for the seed storage proteins may be a result of
changes in the amino acid sequence (in particular, change of
degradation stability) enhanced by the new gene insertion in
GM seeds. On the other hand, independent analyses evidenced
that previously undetected insertion-site mutations actually
occurred in various commercialized products, among which
is Maize YieldGard (event Mon810).27 The latter was found to
contain also one truncated copy of each one of the two co-
delivered plasmids “interspersed with six small scrambled
fragments of transgene and genomic DNA”, as well as probable
additional rearrangements that had not been investigated
before.28 Even though the mutations found in many studies
were numerous, the analytical techniques used may underes-
timate the true numbers because they are likely to miss most
point mutations and small deletions, which instead could be
revealed by proteomics.
However, it should be kept in mind that the detection of
changes in protein profiles does not present a safety issue per
se ; the relevance of such changes for food safety should be
assessed (also in the context of the natural variation not
investigated here) by subsequent elucidation of the nature of
the proteins affected.37
Concluding Remarks
From our data it can be elicited that environment plays the
main influence on proteomic profiles of transgenic seeds, but

also that particle bombardment by itself induces additional
genome alterations which cause a different protein expression.
Moreover, a different response of transgenic organisms to
environmental changes occurred as a consequence of a genome
rearrangement in transgenic plants upon particle bombard-
ment. In this context, it should be noted that the occurrence
of unintended effects is not unique to the application of
recombinant DNA techniques. It is an inherent and general
phenomenon that occurs frequently in traditional breeding, for
example, due to hybridization (potato breeding lines with novel,
toxic glycoalkaloids38), natural genetic recombination, natural
chromosomal rearrangements (translocations and inversions),
activity of transposable elements in plant genomes, cell fusion,
or chemical and radiation induced mutations.2,10 Thus it is not
surprising that in vitro DNA manipulations, as performed for
GM organisms, may statistically induce more unintended
effects than natural recombination. However, the aim of the
safety assessment of novel foods, including those produced by
GM technologies, is to demonstrate that the novel food is as
safe as its traditional counterpart (where one exists), thus, being
totally free from any additional or new risks to consumer’s
health. Thus, a combination of targeted and nontargeted
methods of analysis (to be chosen on a case-by-case basis) is
likely to be the best way for evaluating the safety of both GM
and conventionally bred crops, and for choosing the transgenic
seeds having the less negative alterations. In this regard,
proteomic profiling by 2-DE is a promising tool for screening
purposes, and although the number of proteins that can be
analyzed by 2-DE is still limited with respect to the number of
proteins predicted to be present in a plant proteome, it remains
the most widely used tool for high-resolution protein separation
and quantification. Like other profiling methods, proteomic
screening is not yet a routine practice when assessing the safety
of GM products, but it has the potential of reducing uncertainty
by providing many more data on crop composition than those
obtained with targeted analysis alone. It could be stated that,
where genomic analysis cannot reveal inadvertent modifica-
tions, proteomics could be a powerful tool. An exhaustive
differential proteomic analysis allows the determination of
similarities and differences between the existing food and the
new products (substantial equivalence), and a case-by-case
assessment of the new food should be always carried out.5
Obviously, much remains to be discovered about genome-wide
and insertion-site mutations, but the lack of information,
especially for crop plants and particle bombardment, means
that plant transformation requires a careful investigation.
