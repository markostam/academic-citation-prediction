Abstract
It is now widely recognized that the packaging of genomic DNA together with core histones, linker histones, and
other functional proteins into chromatin profoundly influences nuclear processes such as transcription,
replication, repair and recombination. How chromatin structure modulates the expression and maintenance of
knowledge encoded in eukaryotic genomes, and how these processes take place within the context of a highly
complex and compacted genomic chromatin environment remains a major unresolved question in biology. Here
we review recent advances in our understanding of how nucleosome and chromatin structure may have to adapt
to promote these vital functions.
Introduction
Virtually all studies of processes that require access
to eukaryotic DNA have to take into account its
packaging with a roughly equal mass of proteins to
form large macromolecular assemblages, collectively
termed chromatin. Histones, by forming nucleo-
somes, are responsible for the first level of structural
organization (Luger et al. 1997). Hundreds of
thousands of nucleosomes are further compacted into
hierarchical structures of increasing complexity, yet
largely unknown architecture (Luger & Hansen
2005). It has become clear that any mechanism that
has the potential to alter the level of compaction
must have an inherent role in regulating DNA
accessibility.
The nucleosome core particle (NCP) is the univer-
sally repeating unit in chromatin with a molecular
weight of 210 kDa. High-resolution crystal structures
of the NCP from different organisms (Luger et al.
1997, White et al. 2001, Chantalat et al. 2003,
Tsunaka et al. 2005), or containing histone variants
(Suto et al. 2000, Chakravarthy et al. 2005) and
mutants (Muthurajan et al. 2004), have been deter-
mined. These structures reveal an octameric histone
core around which 147 base pairs of DNA are
wrapped in 1.65 superhelical turns (Figure 1). The
histone octamer itself is composed of two copies
each of the four histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and
H4 (see Luger & Richmond 1998a, 1998b, for
reviews of nucleosome structure). The massive
distortion of the DNA is brought about by the tight
interaction between the rigid framework of the
histone proteins with the DNA at fourteen indepen-
dent DNA-binding locations (Luger & Richmond
1998a). With respect to nucleosome and chromatin
dynamics, several aspects of nucleosome structure
are particularly noteworthy. First, the nucleosome
exhibits a modular assembly in which the two
H2AYH2B dimers (shown in yellow/red in Figure 1)
can be removed while interaction between the DNA
and the (H3YH4)2 tetramer is maintained (Akey &
Luger 2003). This reflects in-vivo and in-vitro
assembly (and perhaps also disassembly) pathways.

Second, rather drastic changes in the amino acid
sequence of histones (for example, as seen in histone
variants) are for the most part accommodated without
significant changes in nucleosome structure and
stability (Chakravarthy et al. 2004). Third, the
nucleosomal surface (which is to a large part defined
by the histone octamer), is a highly contoured
landscape with a very distinctive charge distribution
(Chakravarthy et al. 2004) (Figure 2). It is this
surface that is implicated in nucleosomeYnucleosome
contacts to promote higher-order structure formation.
Fourth, all crystal structures of mono-nucleosomes
reported to date have been determined with particles
reconstituted onto 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA.
The ends of the DNA are engaged in base-stacking
interactions that are vital for crystal packing (Figure
1). Thus, it is possible that the penultimate 10Y20
base pairs of DNA, as viewed in the crystal structure,
may actually be more variable in their conformation
in the context of long nucleosomal arrays or higher-
order structure.
The histones within the nucleosome have evolved
to accomplish two conflicting yet vital tasks: first, the
õ2 m of eukaryotic DNA have to be packaged within
the confines of the nucleus, preventing knots and
tangles and protecting the genome from physical
damage. Second, the information that is encoded
within the DNA needs to be accessed at appropriate
times, and this is to a large part regulated by local
changes in nucleosome and chromatin structure by
complex mechanisms that are only now emerging.
The concept that chromatin and nucleosomes are
inherently dynamic and highly malleable is not
entirely new (see, for example, Glotov et al. 1982,
Pennings et al. 1991) but does go against the intuitive
knowledge that an assembly in which DNA is
tethered to a protein spool via õ240 direct and
indirect contacts along its entire length (Davey et al.
2002) is unlikely to undergo spontaneous rearrange-
ments. Histones have evolved to highly constrain
DNA to achieve approximately five-fold compaction
at the first level and to promote the formation of
higher-order structure; yet, a variety of pathways
ensure highly regulated access to the packaged DNA
(Table 1).
DNA accessibility is regulated by several
mechanisms
Several mechanisms exist to make nucleosomal
DNA more accessible to the cellular machinery: the
transient dissociation and re-binding of the ends
of nucleosomal DNA; nucleosome sliding and
Fremodelling_ (spontaneous or catalysed); and changes
in chromatin higher-order structure (Figure 3). All of
these are affected directly by modifications in the
amino acid sequence of histones (either by post-
translational modifications, or by the introduction of
histone variants). Additionally, remodelling factors,
histone chaperones, and chromatin-binding proteins all
contribute in a combinatorial manner to the structural
changes that are necessary to allow access to the DNA
template.
Transient site-exposure by dissociation and
re-binding (breathing) of the ends of nucleosomal
DNA
Transient site-exposure by dissociation and re-bind-
ing (breathing) of the ends of nucleosomal DNA
(Figure 3A; first proposed by Widom and coworkers:
Polach & Widom 1995, Anderson & Widom 2000,
Li & Widom 2004) has been studied mostly in mono-
nucleosomes; however, it is likely to occur at least to
a certain extent under in-vivo conditions. It provides
an explanation for the relatively higher affinity of a
transcription factor for its binding site near the
nucleosomal entry and exit point, and for the
observed co-operative binding of eukaryotic regula-
tory proteins to nucleosomal target sites. It is
conceivable that DNA breathing also facilitates the
invasion of nucleosomal DNA by RNA polymerases.
We have recently shown that accessibility of tran-

Dynamic nucleosomes 9
scription factor binding sites that are near the
nucleosomal dyad may also be regulated by this
phenomenon (Figure 3A, middle panel; White &
Luger 2004). From a structural viewpoint, it is likely
that the nature of proteinYDNA interactions (for
example, by the introduction of a histone H3 variant
or by posttranslational modifications) at the penulti-
mate one or two attachment points affects the
dynamic equilibrium between the partially bound
and partially unbound state. This equilibrium is also
likely to be shifted towards the unbound state by the
transient removal of H2AYH2B dimers by histone
chaperones (Figure 3A, bottom panel).
Nucleosome sliding
Nucleosome sliding is a phenomenon that has
unfortunately been misnamed: it is not the nucleo-
some that slides (this would be impossible, since the
nucleosome actually includes the DNA) but rather
the position of the histone octamer with respect to the
DNA is altered; thus, a more appropriate name would
be histone octamer sliding (Figure 3B). Irrespective
of nomenclature, this process frees up DNA sequen-
ces that were previously bound by the histone
octamer. Under certain in-vitro conditions, nucleo-
some sliding occurs spontaneously in a temperature-
dependent manner (Pennings et al. 1991). The
temperatures required for sliding in defined model
systems allow for a comparison of the relative
stability of histoneYDNA interactions in nucleosomes
reconstituted with histone mutants or histone variants
(Flaus et al. 2004). While it is likely that spontaneous
nucleosome sliding occurs in vivo at least to some
extent, it is also promoted by large and highly
complex ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling
machines (recently reviewed in Smith & Peterson
2005), and by histone chaperones (Park et al. 2005).
Remodelling of chromatin and nucleosomes
The concept of Fremodelling_ of chromatin and
nucleosomes in the true sense of the word has gone
out of fashion in recent years as the nucleosome
sliding activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remod-
elling factor has taken centre stage. The term
Fremodelling_ was originally coined to explain the
effects of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling
factors on defined nucleosomal substrates, such as
changes in DNase footprinting and changes in
DNAYprotein contacts (Peterson & Tamkun 1995).
It was suggested that the path of the DNA on the
histone octamer was changed in an undefined man-
ner, and that the very nature of histoneYDNA
interactions was altered, resulting in increased tran-
scription levels. To date, it is unclear whether this is
only observed under relatively restricted in-vitro
conditions, or whether it is a physiologically relevant
outcome of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling.
Changes in chromatin higher-order structure
Most of the phenomena discussed above have been
studied mainly on mono-nucleosomes or on defined
nucleosomal arrays. It is unclear whether and how
they take place in the context of various levels of
chromatin higher-order structure. Thus, it is likely
that changes in chromatin higher-order structure need
to precede many, if not all of the steps listed above.
In and of itself, any change in the degree of
compaction potentially has the most pronounced
effect on DNA accessibility (Figure 3C). Until
recently, not very much was known about the
molecular details of higher-order structure beyond
the nucleosome, and therefore accounts of changes in
the degree of compaction have lacked a molecular
basis. Recent breakthroughs in elucidating the struc-
ture of a tetra-nucleosome give hope that we will
eventually be able to understand the different levels
of chromatin higher-order structure and the mecha-
nisms that promote their interconversion (Dorigo
et al. 2004, Schalch et al. 2005).
Post-translational modifications of histones
Post-translational modifications of histones affect
chromatin structure at various levels. Numerous
review articles address the ever-growing number of
combinations of post-translational histone modifica-
tions and the cross-talk between the involved
enzymatic activities (see Cosgrove & Wolberger
2005, for a recent review). The long-standing view
10 K. Luger
that the flexible histone tails are the main targets of
post-translational modifications has recently been
revised, and we now know of a multitude of residues
within the structured portions of the histones that are
targets for modifying enzymes (Freitas et al. 2004).
There are now about 150 known histone modifica-
tions but the numbers are expected to increase at a
steady rate.
Post-translational modifications of histones appear
to be involved in nearly all aspects of DNA biology,
and an exhaustive review would clearly be beyond
the scope of this article. However, two points are
important to note. First, all of the post-translational
modifications known to date are reversible. The last
bastion of irreversible histone modification, the
methylation of lysines, was recently found to be
reversed by the action of a demethylase (Shi et al.
2004, and reviewed in Wysocka et al. 2005). The
enzymes that are responsible for attachment and
removal of post-translational modifications are often
present at the same time. Thus, the ensemble of
modifications at any given time and location is
likely to undergo constant dynamic change. Second,
histone modifications quite dramatically alter the
character and reactivity of the particular amino acid.
This is most obviously true for the Fbulky_ modifica-
tions such as ADP ribosylation, ubiquitylation, and
sumoylation; but also for acetylation and methylation
(monoYdi, and Ytrimethylation) of lysines, which
generates strange amino acids indeed.
Histone tails
The precise mechanism by which any combination
of histone modifications results in the observed
effects on transcription and repair has remained
elusive. An obvious, but perhaps somewhat sim-
plistic hypothesis is that changes in the charge of
the histone tails alter their ability to bind and
constrain nucleosomal DNA. Earlier evidence has
suggested that histone tails do regulate access to
nucleosomal DNA (Lee et al. 1993), although their
effect on DNA breathing is predicted to be weak
(Polach et al. 2000, Mutskov et al. 1998). Circum-
stantial evidence from our own lab indicates that
histone tails do contribute to a certain extent to the
binding of the DNA ends, and their removal appears
to lower the energy barrier for repositioning of the
DNA with respect to the histone octamer (Gottesfeld
et al. 2001, Edayathumangalam & Luger manuscript
in preparation). It is likely that these effects will be
modulated by the presence of post-translational
modifications within the histone tails. However, it is
important to note that all the experiments cited above
were done in the context of a mononucleosome. It is
quite possible that the histone tails assume their true
function(s) only in the context of chromatin higher-
order structure, or at the very least in a polynucleoso-
mal environment.
Another commonly held view is that the histone
tails with their varying degree of modifications
contribute to the recruitment of specific protein
factors that Fread the histone code,_ with various
outcomes for DNA accessibility. For example,
heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a structural com-
ponent of silent (highly compacted) chromatin at
telomeres and centromeres, requires methylation at
lysine 9 of histone H3 (Jacobs & Khorasanizadeh
2002, and references therein); similarly, the interac-
tion of Sir3 with chromatin requires its own set of
histone tail modifications (reviewed in Millar et al.
2004). There are many more such examples, amply
supported by structural studies that provide a basis
for our understanding of selectivity.
Post-translational modifications, specifically in the
structured regions of the four core histones, may also
directly affect DNA accessibility by altering pro-
teinYDNA interactions. Several of the residues that
were recently found to be modified are involved in
interaction with the DNA, and we have shown earlier
that subtle changes at a single proteinYDNA interface
near the nucleosomal dyad can alter the in-vitro
sliding properties of nucleosomes by disrupting three
to five of the total 120 hydrogen bonds between
histones and DNA (Muthurajan et al. 2003, Flaus &
Owen-Hughes 2003).
Lastly, post-translational modifications of histone
tails and surface residues have the potential to alter
nucleosomeYnucleosome interactions. The formation
of higher-order structures, by definition, requires the
close packing of nucleosomal surfaces, and post-
translational modifications are expected to alter the
surface shape and charge of nucleosomes. Addition-
ally, the surface of the histone octamer within the
nucleosome is likely to act as a binding platform for
histone tails (Dorigo et al. 2003, 2004, Gordon et al.
2005) or other protein factors; again, interactions
may be altered depending on the set of existing
Dynamic nucleosomes 11
modifications on either histone tails or structured
regions of the histone proteins.
Crystallographic studies have shown that stacking
of nucleosomes is achieved by a close packing of the
surfaces mainly defined by the histone octamer, and
that several energetically favourable modes of inter-
action are possible (White et al. 2001).
Histone variants: subtle and not-so-subtle effects on
nucleosome and chromatin structure
Substitution of one or more of the core histones with
the corresponding histone variant has the potential to
exert considerable influence on the structure and
function of nucleosomes and chromatin (reviewed in
Chakravarthy et al. 2004). Histone variants are
distinct non-allelic forms of major-type histones
whose expression pattern is not restricted to S-phase.
They are found in most eukaryotic organisms, and
are expressed in all tissue types. Histone variants
exhibit moderate to significant degrees of sequence
homology with their corresponding major-type
counterparts: H2A.X (82%) and H3.3 (õ96%) are
the least divergent of all histone variants; they dif-
fer in only a few amino acids from their replication-
dependent counterparts. H2A.Z (õ60%), macroH2A
(õ65%), H2A.Bbd (40%), and CenpA which has a
93 amino acid domain that is 62% identical to H3
are increasingly divergent in their histone moiety
from H2A and H3, respectively. As is the case with
histones in general, the structured regions of the
histones (encompassing histone folds and exten-
sions) are more conserved than the histone tails. In
many cases, histone variants are even more con-
served than their highly conserved major-type
paralogues (Sullivan et al. 2002), indicating that
they all have evolved to fulfil important functions
that cannot be accomplished by major-type H2A and
H3.
The replacement of histones H2A or H3 with their
corresponding variants can have several outcomes on
chromatin structure. First, subtle structural variations
that result from sequence differences have been
described in two instances where the crystal structure
of variant-containing nucleosomes has been solved
(Suto et al. 2000, Chakravarthy et al. 2005). DNA
binding and stability of variant-containing nucleo-
somes may be altered, as found for nucleosomes
containing H2A.Z (Abbott et al. 2001, Park et al.
2004) and H2A.Bbd (Bao et al. 2004, Gautier et al.
2004). In vivo, this may result in facilitated or
decreased histone eviction during transcription pro-
cesses. Evidence for this has recently been presented
for yeast H2A.Z (Zhang et al. 2005). Second,
nucleosome sliding (Flaus et al. 2004) or ATP-
dependent chromatin remodelling may be affected
(Angelov et al. 2000, Santisteban et al. 2000). Third,
the nucleosomal surface may be altered significantly
(Chakravarthy et al. 2004), with profound implica-
tions for nucleosomeYnucleosome interactions, as
shown for H2A.Z (Fan et al. 2004b). Third, the
availability of sites for post-translational modifica-
tions within the tails are altered (perhaps most
drastically for H2A.Bbd; Bao et al. 2004), but also
for other histone variants, most notable for H2A.X)
and this may confer profound changes on chromatin
structure that are more or less independent of
nucleosome structure.
ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factors:
many machines, many products
Many comprehensive reviews have been published
on the mechanisms by which ATP-dependent
chromatin remodelling machines non-covalently
alter nucleosome structure (for example, Fan et al.
2004a, Smith & Peterson 2005). It has become clear
that different chromatin remodelling factors generate
different Fremodelled_ substrates, and that these
differences can be ascribed to the type of ATPase
present in the complex (Fan et al. 2004a). The
observed outcomes also appear to depend to a certain
extent on the model system that is used to study these
activities. Given the multitude of different remodel-
ling complexes and the variety of experimental
systems, it is not surprising that there is evidence
for the promotion of nucleosome sliding, histone
exchange, histone eviction, and changes in higher-
order structure. Just as with many histone modifi-
cations, the link between chromatin remodelling
and transcription regulation has been firmly estab-
lished; however, mechanistic details remain to be
filled in.
Histone chaperones join the dance
In the cell, histones are usually found in complex
with a diverse group of histone-binding proteins,
12 K. Luger
the so-called histone chaperones (Akey & Luger
2003). These are chaperones in the true sense of the
word, since they prevent improper interactions (for
example, non-native interactions between histones
and DNA, or between histones and other proteins),
and promote proper ones that result in the formation
of the nucleosome. Their predominant role was
thought to be in nucleosome assembly; however,
recent data implies that they have a role in regulating
DNA accessibility in the absence of DNA replica-
tion. For example, yeast nucleosome assembly
protein 1 (yNAP-1) is capable of removing histone
H2AYH2B dimers from folded nucleosomes, and,
depending on availability, replaces them with canon-
ical or variant dimers in vitro (Bruno et al. 2004,
Park et al. 2005). yNAP-1 has also been shown to be
a component of the remodelling complex Swr1 that
is responsible for the exchange of the H2A variant
H2A.Z into yeast chromatin (Mizuguchi et al. 2004).
The transient removal of H2AYH2B dimers from
mononucleosomes also results in nucleosome sliding
(Park et al. 2005) and promotes DNA breathing (Park
et al. unpublished observations).
It remains to be seen how general a phenomenon
this is. For example, do histone chaperones other
than yNAP-1 also promote nucleosome sliding? Is
this activity relevant in vivo? Can NAP-1-mediated
histone exchange and sliding also be observed in
nucleosomal arrays? The observation that H2AYH2B
dimers (and, to a certain extent, also (H3YH4)2
tetramers) appear to be in rapid exchange in most
regions of compacted chromatin (Jackson 1990,
Kimura & Cook 2001) and that histone variants are
incorporated in replication-independent assembly
pathways (Ahmad & Henikoff 2002) is certainly
consistent with the notion that histone chaperones
play an important role in promoting chromatin
fluidity in vivo.
Nucleosome-binding proteins
An increasing number of non-histone proteins are
known to directly bind to nucleosomes, with con-
sequences on nucleosome and chromatin structure and
dynamics. These include the highly abundant linker
histones and high-mobility group proteins, architec-
tural proteins, and an increasing number of transcrip-
tion factors. A common emerging theme is that many
of these factors are only transiently associated with
chromatin (see, for example, Nagaich et al. 2004,
Agresti et al. 2005). Surprisingly, this holds true
even for histone H1 which appears to exchange
rapidly in euchromatin as well as in heterochromatin
(Misteli et al. 2000, Lever et al. 2000).
H1 is referred to as the Flinker histone_ due to
its association with the DNA that links two neigh-
bouring nucleosomes in an array (linker DNA;
Hansen 2002). One linker histone is associated with
nearly every nucleosome in mammalian cells. H1
promotes the organization of chromatin into the 30 nm
filament and increases the repeat length of nucleo-
somes in vitro. In addition to a structural role, H1
subtypes and variants also have gene-specific effects
on transcription (Thomas 1999, Lee et al. 2004), and
impinge on cell cycle regulation (Khochbin 2001).
The mechanism by which H1 exerts these functions
remains unclear, and the location of H1 in the
filament, its role in filament formation, and the
structure of the 30-nm filament itself have all been
controversial.
Some studies suggest that H1 organizes linker
DNA in a stem-like organization towards the nucle-
osome (Bednar et al. 1998, Toth et al. 2001),
however, other models also exist (reviewed in
Travers 1999). The general location of H1 near the
entry and exit point of nucleosomal DNA, and the
fact that it organizes linker DNA imply that H1
affects the breathing of DNA ends. In vitro, the
binding of H1 clearly has an inhibitory effect on
nucleosome sliding (Ragab & Travers 2003) and on
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (Hill &
Imbalzano 2000). Finally, linker histone binding to
nucleosomal sites stabilizes folded chromatin fibers,
but does not direct their formation (Georgel &
Hansen 2001).
A review of chromatin architectural proteins with
clear effects on chromatin higher-order structure is
presented in this issue (McBryant et al. 2006).
Additionally, the three families of high-mobility
group proteins or HMGs (after histones, the second
most abundant chromatin proteins with distinct
effects on chromatin structure; Bianchi & Agresti
2005) are worth mentioning. HMGNs (formerly
HMG14/17) are among the few nuclear proteins
known to specifically recognize the generic structure
of the nucleosome (Bustin 1999). Their binding has
no effect on nucleosome remodelling or on the
compaction of defined nucleosomal arrays in vitro
Dynamic nucleosomes 13
(Hill et al. 2005); however, earlier reports describe
that they unfold chromatin higher-order structure by
competing with linker histones, a characteristic that
seems to be common to all three groups of HMG
proteins (Catez et al. 2004).
Chromatin modifying activities are recruited to
chromatin regions of interest by transcriptional
activators and repressors. This requires the ability
of at least some of these regulatory factors to rec-
ognize their binding site in the structural context of a
nucleosome. Despite the identification of an increas-
ing number of regulatory factors that are capable of
targeting chromatin, the molecular details of such
interactions have been largely uncharacterized. Not
surprisingly, transcription factor binding to the NCP
is affected greatly by the rotational and translational
position of the binding site with respect to the histone
octamer. Binding sites that face inwards on the DNA
superhelix are occluded from solvent by the tight
interaction with histone proteins, thus providing an
obvious explanation for the dependence on rota-
tional position (Gottesfeld et al. 2001). Binding
sites that are located towards the end of nucleosomal
DNA are usually bound with higher affinity than
those located near the nucleosomal dyad (e.g. Li
et al. 1994). This has been explained by the
phenomenon of transient exposure of binding sites
by partial dissociation of terminal regions of DNA
from the histone octamer (see above). It has also
been suggested that partial dissociation of the
histone octamer (for example, dissociation of a
H2A/H2B dimer) would have to occur before a
transcription factor would be able to bind to
nucleosomal DNA (Figure 3; Spangenberg et al.
1998), a process which may be facilitated by ATP-
dependent chromatin-remodelling factors (e.g. Bruno
et al. 2003) or histone chaperones (Chen et al. 1994,
Ito et al. 2000, Bao et al. 2004). Finally, the flexible
histone tails are likely to be involved in the
regulation of nucleosomal DNA accessibility (for
example, Vitolo et al. 2000, and see above). Thus,
transcription factor binding to nucleosomes can have
an effect on nucleosome sliding and positioning (e.g.
McPherson et al. 1993), DNA breathing by capturing
the DNA in the unbound state (White & Luger 2004),
and chromatin remodelling, the latter most likely
through the recruitment of ATP-dependent chromatin
remodelling factors (see, for example, Tsukiyama
et al. 1994, Cirillo et al. 2002).
Conclusions and outlook
It has become clear that the many cellular activities
that impinge upon chromatin structure operate via
multiple and complex mechanisms. Mounting evi-
dence demonstrates that ATP-dependent chromatin
remodelling factors, histone-chaperones, histone
modifying enzymes, and nucleosome-binding pro-
teins affect different levels of chromatin organization
in a highly orchestrated and concerted manner. It is
highly unlikely that, for example, every promoter is
made accessible via a unified order of events; rather,
each and every incidence of regulated DNA accessi-
bility will have to be studied independently to
identify the important players and order of events
that are necessary for the regulation of DNA
accessibility. An additional uncertainty is the struc-
ture of the actual substrate itself. For a complete
understanding of regulated DNA accessibility at any
given site, we need to understand, at molecular
detail, the structure of the underlying chromatin.
