Abstract
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) have shown
chemopreventive effects in both preclinical and clinical
studies; however, the precise molecular mechanism governing
this response remains unclear. We used DNA microarray
techniques to search for genes whose expression is induced by
the NSAID indomethacin in human gastric carcinoma (AGS)
cells. Among identified genes, we focused on those related to
tight junction function (claudin-4 , claudin-1 , and occludin),
particularly claudin-4 . Induction of claudin-4 by indometha-
cin was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. NSAIDs,
other than indomethacin (diclofenac and celecoxib), also
induced claudin-4. All of the tested NSAIDs increased the
intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Other drugs that increased
the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (thapsigargin and ion-
omycin) also induced claudin-4. Furthermore, an intracellular
Ca2+ chelator [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,NV,NV-tetra-
acetic acid] inhibited the indomethacin-dependent induction
of claudin-4. These results strongly suggest that induction of
claudin-4 by indomethacin is mediated through an increase in
the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Overexpression of clau-
din-4 in AGS cells did not affect cell growth or the induction of
apoptosis by indomethacin. On the other hand, addition of
indomethacin or overexpression of claudin-4 inhibited cell
migration. Colony formation in soft agar was also inhibited.
Suppression of claudin-4 expression by small interfering RNA
restored the migration activity of AGS cells in the presence of
indomethacin. Based on these results, we consider that the
induction of claudin-4 and other tight junction–related genes
by NSAIDs may be involved in the chemopreventive effect of
NSAIDs through the suppression of anchorage-independent
growth and cell migration. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(5): 1868-76)
Introduction
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the most
widely used therapeutic agents in the treatment of pain,
inflammation, and fever (1). Recent epidemiologic studies clearly
show that NSAID use is associated with a reduced risk of cancer,
and preclinical and clinical studies have shown that some NSAIDs
are effective for the treatment and prevention of cancer. This effect
is particularly well documented in relation to colon and rectal
cancer. Recent studies have also shown that NSAID use reduces
the risk of stomach cancer (2, 3). Several different effects of
NSAIDs on cancer cells, such as stimulation of apoptosis, cell
growth suppression, inhibition of angiogenesis, and inhibition of
metastasis, have been proposed to play important roles in NSAID-
mediated chemoprevention (4, 5). However, the precise molecular
mechanisms governing these effects of NSAIDs have not been
elucidated.
The anti-inflammatory action of NSAIDs is mediated through its
inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). COX is an enzyme essential for
the synthesis of prostaglandins, which have a strong propensity for
inducing inflammation. Prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), inhibit apoptosis and stimulate cell growth, angiogenesis,
and metastasis (6–8). Furthermore, overexpression of COX-2
(a subtype of COX) has been reported in various tumor cells and
tissues (9, 10). Therefore, the inhibition of COX by NSAIDs was
thought previously to be the sole explanation for their chemo-
preventive effect. However, several lines of evidence suggest that
chemoprevention by NSAIDs also involves COX-independent
mechanisms. Sulindac sulfone, a derivative of the NSAID sulindac,
does not inhibit COX activity and has been shown to display
antitumor activity in vivo as well as induce apoptosis and inhibit
cell growth in tumor cells in vitro (11, 12). Moreover, the induction
by NSAIDs of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth in COX-
null fibroblasts and tumor cells in which COX expression was
absent have been reported (13, 14). Therefore, it is important that
the COX-independent mechanisms for chemoprevention by
NSAIDs are elucidated to develop more effective NSAIDs.
Tight junctions are the most apical intercellular structure in
epithelial and endothelial cells and create a physiologic barrier
separating the apical and basolateral spaces; in other words, they
create a paracellular permeability barrier. Tight junctions contain
the transmembrane proteins occludin and claudin, which are
connected to the cytoskeleton via zonula occludens (ZO-1; ref. 15).
Several studies have shown a correlation between a reduction in
tight junction function and tumor progression. A loss of tight
junction structure is frequently observed in epithelium-derived
cancers, whereas some tumor-promoting agents are known to
disrupt tight junctions (16, 17). Furthermore, overexpression of
tight junction–related proteins (such as claudin-1, claudin-4, and
occludin) in cancer cells has been reported to induce apoptosis and
suppress the invasive potential of these cells (18, 19).
NSAIDs affect the expression of several genes in a COX-
independent manner. For example, NSAIDs induce NAG-1, a
transforming growth factor-h superfamily member protein, which
is involved in the induction of apoptosis by NSAIDs (20).
We reported recently that NSAIDs induce CCAAT/enhancer
binding protein homologous transcription factor, which is involved

in the induction of apoptosis by endoplasmic reticulum stressors.
By using a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous tran-
scription factor–deficient mouse, we showed that this induction is
essential for NSAID-induced apoptosis (21). Therefore, systematic
screening of genes whose expression is induced by NSAIDs is
important for understanding the COX-independent mechanism of
chemoprevention by NSAIDs. In this study, we searched for genes in
human gastric carcinoma (AGS) cells whose expression is induced
by indomethacin. We found that claudin-4, claudin-1, and occludin
were induced in these cells in the presence of indomethacin. We
propose that the induction of claudin-4 is mediated by an increase
in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Moreover, by using claudin-
4-overexpressing cells and small interfering RNA (siRNA), we show
that claudin-4 is involved in the NSAID-mediated suppression of
anchorage-independent growth and cell migration.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Media. Ham’s F-12 and RPMI 1640 were purchased
from Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Fetal bovine serum was
purchased from Life Technologies (Tokyo, Japan). 1,2-Bis(2-aminophe-
noxy)ethane-N ,N ,NV,NV-tetraacetic acid was purchased from Dojindo Co.
(Tokyo, Japan). Thapsigargin, ionomycin, G418, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, diclofenac, and cycloheximide were
purchased from Sigma Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Indomethacin, N-acetylcysteine,
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were from Wako Co. (Tokyo, Japan).
Celecoxib was purchased from LKT Laboratories, Inc. (St. Paul, MN).
Antibodies against claudin-4 and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).
Cell Culture and Overexpression of Claudin-4. AGS cells were cultured
in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Other cell types
(MKN-45, KATO-III, Caco-2, and HCT-15) were cultured in RPMI 1640
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (2  105 per well in a 24-well plate)
were cultured for 24 hours and used in the experiments. Cell viability was
determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-
mide method as described previously (22).
A full-length human claudin-4 cDNA was PCR amplified from the cDNA of
AGS cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Transfection of AGS cells with plasmids was carried out using Lipofect-
AMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
stable transfectants expressing claudin-4 were selected by immunoblotting
analysis. Positive clones were maintained in the presence of 300 Ag/mL G418.
DNA Microarray Analysis. Total RNA was extracted from cells treated
with 0.3mmol/L indomethacin for 4 hours or nontreated cells using a RNeasy
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Samples (10 Ag RNA) were labeled with cyanine 3– or cyanine 5–conjugated
dUTP with the use of an Agilent cDNA labeling kit. The fluorescent-labeled
cDNAs were mixed and hybridized simultaneously to Agilent cDNA
microarray human I. The microarray was scanned with a DNA Microarray
Scanner (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) using laser excitation at 532 and 635 nm
wavelengths for the cyanine 3 and cyanine 5 labels, respectively. The raw pixel
intensity images were analyzed using the Feature Extraction and Analysis
Software version 7.5 (Agilent). After pixel intensity determination and
background subtraction, the ratio of the intensity of the treated cells to the
intensity of the control was calculated following normalization.
Reverse Transcription. Total RNA was extracted from cells using a
RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Samples (10 Ag RNA)
were reverse transcribed using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amer-
sham, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
traditional reverse transcription–coupled PCR (RT-PCR), synthesized cDNA
was amplified by PCR [Takara (Shiga, Japan) PCR Thermal Cycler] using
KOD Plus Polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and reaction products were
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For real-time RT-PCR, synthesized
cDNA was applied to real-time RT-PCR (ABI PRISM 7700) using SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (ABI) and analyzed with ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence
Detection Software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time
cycle conditions were 2 minutes at 50jC followed by 10 minutes at 90jC
and then for 45 cycles at 95jC for 30 seconds and 63jC for 60 seconds.
Specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction
products and by inclusion of template-free or reverse transcriptase–free
controls. To normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction,
GAPDH or actin genes were used as an internal standard.
Primer Design. Primers were designed using the Primer3 Web site
(http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi). Primers are
listed as gene name, forward primer, reverse primer. For RT-PCR: claudin-

GCTCTAGATTACACGTAGTTGCTGGCAGC.
Immunoblotting and Northern Blotting Analyses. Whole cell extracts
were prepared as described previously (23). The protein concentration of
samples was determined by the Bradford method. Samples were applied to
12% SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to electrophoresis, and proteins were
then immunoblotted with respective antibodies.
Total RNA was extracted from the cells using a RNeasy kit according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. Samples (5 Ag RNA) were separated by
agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis in the presence of 6.3% formaldehyde and
blotted onto nylon membranes. DNA probes for claudin-4 were amplified by
PCR and labeled with [a-32P]dCTP (6,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) using the
Rediprime II DNA Labeling System (Amersham) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After hybridization and washing, membranes
were analyzed with BAS2000A (Fujix, Kanagawa, Japan).
Measurement of the Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration, [Ca2+ ]i. The
intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, was monitored according to
manufacturer’s protocols (24). Cells were washed with assay buffer
containing 115 mmol/L NaCl, 5.4 mmol/L KCl, 1.8 mmol/L CaCl2,
0.8 mmol/L MgCl2, 20 mmol/L HEPES, and 13.8 mmol/L glucose. Cells
were then incubated with 4 Amol/L fluo-3/AM in the assay buffer
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.04% Pluronic F127, and 2 mmol/L
probenecid for 40 minutes at 37jC. After washing twice with the assay
buffer, cells were suspended in assay buffer containing 2 mmol/L
probenecid. Fluo-3 fluorescence of cells in a water-jacketed cuvette (1.6
 106 cells per cuvette) was measured with a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) F-4500
spectrofluorophotometer by recording excitation signals at 490 nm and the
emission signal at 530 nm at 1-second intervals. Maximum and minimum
fluorescence values (Fmax and Fmin) were obtained by adding 10 mol/L
ionomycin and 10 mol/L ionomycin plus 5 mmol/L EGTA (in Ca2+-free
medium), respectively. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to the following
equation: [Ca2+]i = Kd (FFmin) / (FmaxF), where Kd is the apparent
dissociation constant (400 nmol/L) of the fluorescence dye-Ca2+ complex
(24).
Cell Migration Assays. In vitro wound healing assays were used to assess
cell migration as described previously (25). Confluent AGS cells on a 24-well
plate were used. Two linear wounds were scratched with a p200 pipette tip.
The cell-free area was measured before and after 24 hours of incubation
(healing step) using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).
Soft Agar Assay. Soft agar assay was done as described previously (26).
Cells (2  104 per dish) were suspended in 0.5 mL of 0.3% Noble agar (Difco,
Detroit, MI) supplemented with complete culture medium. This suspension
was layered over 0.5 mL of a 0.8% agar medium base layer in 35 mm culture
dishes (Iwaki, Chiba, Japan). After 10 days, cells were stained with crystal
violet and colonies were counted.
siRNA Targeting of Claudin-4. Synthetic siRNAs were purchased from
Qiagen. The target DNA sequence of claudin-4 is CCCGCACAGACAAGCCT-
TACT and siRNA 5V-CGCACAGACAAGCCUUACUUU-3V and 5V-AGUAAGG-
CUUGUCUGUGCGGG-3Vwere used as annealed oligonucleotides. AGS cells
were transfected with siRNA using RNAiFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical Analysis. All values are expressed as mean F SE. One-way
ANOVA followed by Scheffe’s multiple comparison test was used for
evaluation of differences between the groups. The Student’s t test for
unpaired results was done for the evaluation of differences between two
groups, which were considered to be significant for values of P < 0.05.
Results
DNA Microarray Analysis for Gene Expression in the
Presence of Indomethacin. We used the DNA microarray
technique and AGS cells to identify genes whose expression is
altered by indomethacin. AGS cells were treated with 0.3 mmol/L
indomethacin for 4 hours before microarray analysis. As shown in
Fig. 1A , this treatment did not affect cell viability. We did microarray
analysis four times ( four hybridizations) and selected genes that
were induced by indomethacin based on the criteria that the
induction was observed in all four hybridizations and that the mean
value ( fold change) of four hybridizations was >2.0. As shown in
Table 1, 34 genes were identified. Induction of some of these genes,
such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein h and prostate differenti-
ation factor (NAG-1), by NSAIDs in other cancer cell types has been
reported previously (20, 27). Among these genes, we focused our
attention on genes related to tight junction function (claudin-1 ,
claudin-4 , and occludin), particularly on claudin-4 , because the
induction was relatively clear, its expression in gastric mucosal cells
has been confirmed previously (28), and a recent report showed that
overexpression of claudin-4 suppressed anchorage-independent
growth and the invasive potential of pancreatic cancer cells (19).
Nineteen genes were identified whose expression was repressed by
the indomethacin treatment (data not shown).
Changes in the indomethacin-induced expression of these genes
were then verified by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1B , the induction of
claudin-1, claudin-4, and occludin was confirmed. Results of the
Figure 1. Induction of tight junction–related genes by NSAIDs. AGS (A -D and G ) or MKN-45, KATO-III, Caco-2, and HCT-15 (E -G) cells were incubated with
indicated concentrations of NSAIDs for 4 hours (A-C ) or 24 hours (D -F ). Results for cells cultured without NSAIDs (G). Cell viability was determined by the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE (A ). Total RNA was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR by
use of a specific primer for each gene. GAPDH (G3PDH ; B) or actin (G) was used as a control. Reaction products were analyzed by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis
(B and G ). Total RNA samples were analyzed by Northern blotting experiments using a specific DNA probe for claudin-4. Bands of rRNA (28S) stained with
ethidium bromide (C). Whole cell extracts (2.5 Ag protein) were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against claudin-4 or actin (D -F ).

real-time RT-PCR experiments used to determine the extent of the
induction yielded fold changes in copy number of 2.3, 3.0, and 1.5
for claudin-1, claudin-4, and occludin mRNA, respectively, in
response to treatment of cells for 4 hours with 0.3 mmol/L
indomethacin. In addition, the induction by indomethacin of
claudin-4 mRNA or claudin-4 protein was confirmed using
Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1C ) and immunoblot analysis
(Fig. 1D), respectively.
We then examined whether the induction of claudin-4 by
indomethacin is specific to AGS cells or is a general property also
observed in other cell types. We used MKN-45 and KATO-III cells
(derived from gastric cancer tissue) and Caco-2 and HCT-15 cells
(derived from colon cancer tissue) to test this effect. As shown in
Fig. 1E , indomethacin induced claudin-4 in each of the cell lines
tested, with the concentration of indomethacin required for the
induction being similar for each cell line.
Diclofenac, another NSAID, also induced claudin-4 in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Some NSAIDs are specific in their
effect on COX, which exists in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2.
Celecoxib, a COX-2-specific NSAID, induced claudin-4 not only in
AGS cells (Fig. 1D) but also in the other cell lines tested (Fig. 1F).
These results suggest that NSAIDs induce claudin-4 irrespective of
whether they are specific for COX-2. It has been reported that
both COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA are expressed in AGS, MKN-45,
and Caco-2 cells, whereas COX-2 mRNA expression is very low in
KATO-III and HCT-15 cells (29–33). COX-1 mRNA expression was
confirmed by RT-PCR in each of the cell lines tested, whereas
COX-2 mRNA expression was detected only in AGS, MKN-45, and
Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1G). Therefore, COX-2-specific NSAIDs (in this
case, celecoxib) induce claudin-4 not only in COX-2-expressing
cells but also in cells lacking COX-2 expression. Furthermore,
whereas indomethacin inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 at a
concentration of <1 nmol/L (34), the induction of claudin-4
required higher concentrations (Fig. 1). These findings strongly
suggest that NSAIDs induce claudin-4 independently of COX-
inhibition.
Mechanism for Induction of Claudin-4 by Indomethacin. For
further confirmation that NSAIDs induce claudin-4 independently
of COX-inhibition, we examined the effect of PGE2, a major
prostaglandin in the gastric mucosa, on the induction of claudin-4

Induction of Claudin-4 by NSAIDs

by indomethacin. PGE2 (0.1-10 Amol/L) did not affect the level of
claudin-4 in the presence and absence of indomethacin (Fig. 2A).
We determined previously the level of PGE2 in the culture medium
of AGS cells to be f10 nmol/L (23). Therefore, inhibition of PGE2
synthesis by indomethacin does not seem to be involved in the
induction of claudin-4 by indomethacin.
Recent studies suggest that indomethacin and other NSAIDs act
as agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g
(35). To test the contribution of this activity to the induction of
claudin-4 by indomethacin, we examined the effect of a peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-g antagonist (GW9662) on the
induction of claudin-4 by indomethacin. As shown in Fig. 2B ,
GW9662 did not inhibit but rather slightly heightened the
induction of claudin-4 by indomethacin. The different concen-
trations of GW9662 tested did not affect cell viability (data not
shown), but based on data from a previous report, these
concentrations are considered sufficient to inhibit agonist binding
to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (36). Therefore,
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g does not seem to be
associated with the induction of claudin-4 by indomethacin.
It has been reported that some NSAIDs increase reactive oxygen
species production (37). To test the contribution of reactive oxygen
species to the induction of claudin-4 by indomethacin, we examined
the effects of the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and SOD. As shown in
Fig. 2C and D, neither N-acetylcysteine nor SOD affected claudin-4
expression in either the presence or the absence of indomethacin.
Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway—one
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways—has been reported
to stimulate the expression of claudin-4. Although some NSAIDs have
been reported to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
pathway (19, 38), an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(PD98059) did not affect the expression of claudin-4 in either the
presence or the absence of indomethacin (Fig. 2E). N-acetylcysteine,
SOD, and PD98059 did not affect cell viability at the concentrations
used (data not shown). These results suggest that neither reactive
oxygen species nor extracellular signal-regulated kinase is responsible
for the induction of claudin-4 by indomethacin.
Some NSAIDs have been reported to increase the intracellular
Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i (39, 40). In this study, we tested whether
an increase in [Ca2+]i by NSAIDs is responsible for the induction of
claudin-4. Firstly, we confirmed that a NSAID-induced increase in
[Ca2+]i occurred under the same conditions as those in which the
induction of claudin-4 in AGS cells was observed. As shown in
Fig. 3A , all NSAIDs tested (indomethacin, diclofenac, and celecoxib)
increased [Ca2+]i at the same NSAID concentrations that caused
the induction of claudin-4.
Some drugs that are known to increase [Ca2+]i were examined
for their capacity to induce claudin-4 expression. The actions of
thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic retic-
ulum Ca2+ ATPase, and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin were thus
tested on AGS cells. As shown in Fig. 3A-C , in addition to
increasing [Ca2+]i, both thapsigargin and ionomycin induced
claudin-4 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, an intracel-
lular Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,NV,NV-
tetraacetic acid, was found to inhibit the induction of claudin-4
not only by ionomycin but also by indomethacin (Fig. 3D). 1,2-
Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,NV,NV-tetraacetic acid did not
affect cell viability at the concentration used in these experiments
(data not shown). These results strongly suggest that induction of
claudin-4 by indomethacin is mediated via an increase in [Ca2+]i.
Role of Claudin-4 Induction in the In vitro Antitumor Action
of NSAIDs. As described in Introduction, various mechanisms
have been proposed for the chemopreventive action of NSAIDs;
these include the inhibition of cell growth, stimulation of

of indicated concentrations of PGE2 (A), GW9662 (B ), N -acetylcysteine (NAC ; C), SOD (D ), or PD98059 (E). Levels of claudin-4 and actin were estimated
by immunoblotting experiments as described in Fig. 1. One unit of SOD was evaluated based on its inhibitory effect on the reduction of cytochrome c as described

apoptosis, and inhibition of metastasis. Here, we examined the
contribution that NSAID induction of claudin-4 makes to the
antitumor effect of NSAIDs in vitro . We constructed stable
transfectants of AGS cells that continuously overexpress claudin-
4 and selected four clones (clones 1, 6, 7, and 11) in which the
level of expression of claudin-4 varied (clone 7 > clone 11 >
clone 1 > clone 6; Fig. 4A).
Figure 4B shows the cell growth curve for each clone. The
growth of cells from each clone was indistinguishable from that of
the mock transfectant control, demonstrating that overexpression
of claudin-4 did not affect the growth of AGS cells. Therefore,
induction of claudin-4 by NSAIDs does not seem to be involved in
the inhibition of cell growth by NSAIDs.
We also examined the effect of overexpression of claudin-4 on
the induction of apoptosis. In the absence of indomethacin, the
cell viability of each clone, as determined by the trypan blue
exclusion test, was close to 100%, showing that expression of
claudin-4 does not affect cell viability. As shown in Fig. 4C , the
dose-response curve for the decrease in cell viability by
indomethacin was indistinguishable between each of the clau-
din-4-overexpressing clones and the mock transfectant control.
Further, we confirmed that the cell death (Fig. 4C) was mediated
by apoptosis as evidenced by apoptotic DNA fragmentation,
activation of caspase-3, and chromatin condensation (data not
shown). The results presented in Fig. 4C show that claudin-4
overexpression does not affect the indomethacin-induced cell
apoptosis. Therefore, the induction of claudin-4 by NSAIDs does
not seem to be involved in NSAID-mediated apoptosis.
The anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells, which can
be measured by colony formation in soft agar, is important for
tumor progression. NSAIDs are known to inhibit colony
formation of some cancer cells in soft agar (13); recently, it
Figure 3. Involvement of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the
induction of claudin-4 by NSAIDs. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration,

in Materials and Methods. Indomethacin (0.3 mmol/L), celecoxib
(0.02 mmol/L), diclofenac (0.1 mmol/L), thapsigargin (5 nmol/L), or
ionomycin (0.5 Amol/L) were added to fluo-3/AM-loaded cells at
indicated concentrations, and the time course of changes to fluo-3
fluorescence was monitored (A). AGS cells were incubated with
indicated concentrations of thapsigargin (B) or ionomycin (C ) for 24
hours. AGS cells were incubated with 0.3 mmol/L indomethacin (IND )
or 2 Amol/L ionomycin (ION ) in the presence of indicated
concentrations of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N ,N ,N V,N V-

of claudin-4 and actin were estimated by immunoblotting experiments
as described in Fig. 1 (B-D ).

was reported that overexpression of claudin-4 in pancreatic
cancer cells inhibited colony formation in soft agar (19). In this
study, we examined the effect of claudin-4 overexpression and
the presence of indomethacin on the anchorage-independent
growth of AGS cells. We first examined the colony-forming
ability of each of the claudin-4-overexpressing clones in soft
agar. All clones showed less activity for colony formation in soft
agar than the mock transfectant control (Fig. 4D), which is
consistent with previous results obtained using pancreatic cancer
cells (19). We compared the extent of inhibition of colony
formation in soft agar with the degree of claudin-4 overproduc-
tion in these clones and found a close correlation between the
two (Fig. 4A and D).
We also examined the effect of indomethacin on colony
formation of AGS cells in soft agar. Because a long incubation
period (10 days) was required for this assay, relatively low
concentrations of indomethacin were used. As shown in Fig. 4E ,
indomethacin (100 Amol/L) significantly decreased the colony-
forming ability of AGS cells in soft agar. Real-time RT-PCR
experiments confirmed that claudin-4 mRNA expression in AGS
cells was induced at the concentration of indomethacin used
(Fig. 4F). These results suggest that the induction of claudin-4 is
involved in the indomethacin-dependent inhibition of AGS cell
colony formation in soft agar.
The migration activity of tumor cells is also very important
for tumor progression. We examined the relationship between
expression of claudin-4 and migration activity in AGS cells.
Wound healing assays were carried out in which the cell-free
area was measured at the time a wound was made and
then 24 hours later. Because neither claudin-4 overexpression
nor addition of NSAIDs affected the growth of AGS cells (Fig. 4B ;
data not shown), a smaller cell-free area is indicative of
a higher activity for cell migration. As shown in Fig. 5A ,
claudin-4-overexpresing cells (clone 7) showed less cell migration
activity than the mock transfectant control. Furthermore,
transfection of siRNA for claudin-4 stimulated the migration
activity of AGS cells even in the absence of indomethacin (Fig.
5B). We confirmed that the transfection almost completely
inhibited the expression of claudin-4 in AGS cells (Fig. 5C).
These results suggest that the migration activity of AGS cells
decreases as claudin-4 expression increases.
As shown in Fig. 5B , indomethacin inhibited the activity of AGS
cells for cell migration and this inhibitory effect was almost
completely suppressed by the transfection of siRNA for claudin-4.
We confirmed that transfection of siRNA almost completely

inhibited the induction of claudin-4 by indomethacin (Fig. 5C).
Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that inhibition
of cell migration by indomethacin is mediated through the
induction of claudin-4.
Discussion
We have shown here that some tight junction–related genes,
especially claudin-4 , are induced by NSAIDs. Although NSAIDs
and tight junctions are closely associated in relation to cancer
progression, this is the first time that a connection between
NSAIDs and tight junctions has been shown at the molecular
level.
It is known that various factors disrupt or stimulate the function
of tight junctions. For example, tumor necrosis factor-a, trans-
forming growth factor-a, and interleukin-1 disrupt tight junctions,
whereas transforming growth factor-h, interleukin-10, and PGE2
are known to stimulate the function of tight junctions (41).
However, the effect of these factors on the expression of
components of tight junctions (such as claudin-4) has not been
examined to the same extent. It seems that the alteration of tight
junction function is not always correlated with an alteration in the
expression of tight junction components. For example, we have
found that PGE2, which is known to stimulate the function of tight
junctions, does not induce claudin-4. Because the expression of
claudin-4 affects various aspects of cancer progression (see below),
we consider that the effect of cancer-promoting agents or
anticancer drugs on claudin-4 expression should be examined
more extensively.
As for a mechanism of claudin-4 induction by NSAIDs, we
postulate that it is mediated by an increase in [Ca2+]i based on
the following observations: (a) NSAIDs increased [Ca2+]i and
induced claudin-4 simultaneously, (b) thapsigargin and ionomycin
increased [Ca2+]i and induced claudin-4, and (c) the intracellular
Ca2+ chelator [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N ,N ,NV,NV-tetraacetic
acid] attenuated the indomethacin-dependent induction of clau-
din-4. As for the mechanism for the increase in [Ca2+]i by NSAIDs,
both inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+
ATPase (endoplasmic reticulum–located Ca2+ pump that is
responsible for accumulation of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum)
and stimulation of the influx of extracellular Ca2+ have been
proposed (40). We found recently that all of the NSAIDs tested
permeabilize the membranes of both erythrocytes and liposomes
(42). This activity of NSAIDs was found to be closely related to their
ability to increase [Ca2+]i, suggesting that NSAIDs permeabilize
membranes and stimulate the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (42).
NSAIDs seem to achieve their chemopreventive effect via
several mechanisms, such as stimulation of apoptosis, cell growth
suppression, inhibition of angiogenesis, and inhibition of
metastasis (4, 5). In this study, we examined the contribution
of claudin-4 induction to the antitumor activity of NSAIDs
in vitro . Experiments using claudin-4-overproducing AGS cells
and siRNA for claudin-4 suggested that NSAID-induced claudin-4
is involved in the NSAID-dependent suppression of anchorage-
independent tumor growth and tumor cell migration but not in
stimulation of apoptosis and cell growth suppression. As for cell
migration, this is the first evidence showing not only that
NSAIDs inhibit of cancer cell migration but also that claudin-4 is
involved in cell migration. It was reported recently that
overexpression of claudin-4 suppressed the invasive potential of
pancreatic cancer cells (19); therefore, if NSAIDs also induce
claudin-4 in vivo , then suppression of the invasive potential of
tumor cells by NSAID-induced claudin-4 may be one of the
mechanisms involved in the inhibition of metastasis by NSAIDs. It
is also possible that the induction of claudin-4 by
NSAIDs contributes to their antitumor activity through other
mechanisms. Tight junctions act as a barrier for diffusion of
molecules that include nutrients and growth factors. It is well
known that the constitutive accessibility of nutrients and growth
factors is very important for tumor progression. Therefore, if
NSAIDs also induce claudin-4 in vivo , then the supply of
nutrients and growth factors to a tumor may be retarded or
inhibited, thereby suppressing tumor progression.
