Abstract
RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcription of most eukaryotic genes, but, despite exhaustive
analysis, little is known about how it transcribes natural templates in vivo. We studied polymerase dynamics
in living Chinese hamster ovary cells using an established line that expresses the largest (catalytic) subunit of
the polymerase (RPB1) tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Genetic complementation has
shown this tagged polymerase to be fully functional. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) reveals
the existence of at least three kinetic populations of tagged polymerase: a large rapidly-exchanging
population, a small fraction resistant to 5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) but sensitive
to a different inhibitor of transcription (i.e. heat shock), and a third fraction sensitive to both inhibitors.
Quantitative immunoblotting shows the largest fraction to be the inactive hypophosphorylated form of
the polymerase (i.e. IIA). Results are consistent with the second (DRB-insensitive but heat-shock-sensitive)
fraction being bound but not engaged, while the third (sensitive to both DRB and heat shock) is the
elongating hyperphosphorylated form (i.e. IIO).
Introduction
RNA polymerase II transcribes most eukaryotic
genes. Although systematic analysis has given us
detailed information on how this enzyme with
12 conserved subunits initiates, elongates, and
terminates on naked DNA templates in vitro
(Lee & Young 2000, Woychik & Hampsey 2002,
Shilatifard et al. 2003, Asturias 2004), little
is yet known about how it transcribes natural
templates in vivo. In order to study polymerase
dynamics in living cells, we developed a cell line
that expresses the largest (catalytic) subunit,
RPB1, tagged with the green ﬂuorescent protein
(GFP). This autoﬂuorescent protein is widely
used to tag proteins so they can be localized
easily (Tsien 1998). Application of techniques
like FRAP (ﬂuorescent recovery after photo-
bleaching) and FLIP (ﬂuorescence loss in photo-
bleaching) then allows measurement of diffusion

coefﬁcients, rates of exchange of the tagged pro-
tein between different cellular compartments, and
the proportions of mobile and immobile fractions
(Houtsmuller & Vermeulen 2001, Lippincott-
Schwartz et al. 2001, Phair & Misteli 2001). For
example, we and others have used these techni-
ques to analyse the kinetics of RNA poly-
merases I and II in vivo (Becker et al. 2002,
Dundr et al. 2002, Kimura et al. 2002).
Our cell line, C23, is derived from tsTM4, a tem-
perature-sensitive mutant of the Chinese hamster
ovary cell, CHO-K1. The mutation in tsTM4,
which grows at 34C but not at 39C, has been
mapped to RPB1 (Tsuji et al. 1990, Sugaya et al.
1997). The gene encoding wild-type human RPB1
was fused with another encoding GFP, and the
construct expressed in tsTM4; the resulting GFP-
tagged polymerase (GFP-pol) complemented the
defect at the restrictive temperature (39C), and so
enabled normal growth (Sugaya et al. 2000). This
indicates the tagged polymerase is functional at
39C, as C23 cells depend on it for survival. How-
ever, C23 also contains the original temperature-
sensitive (endogenous) enzyme that is used in
conjunction with the GFP-pol at 34C.
We went on to analyse the kinetics of the tagged
polymerase in living C23 cells using both FRAP
and FLIP (Kimura et al. 2002). We expected
to ¢nd at least three fractions ^ a large pool of
enzyme able to di¡use freely, a small fraction
incorporated into the pre-initiation complex, and a
third that was elongating and so temporarily
immobilized on the template; the second fraction
would probably be bound only temporarily, while
the third would be bound for the time taken to
make a transcript and it would be sensitive to inhi-
bitors of transcriptional elongation. However,
FRAP data could be ¢tted assuming there were
only two kinetic fractions, with *75% moving
rapidly and *25% being transiently immobile
(association t1/2 *20min). FLIP data were also
consistent with the existence of two populations
but were not analysed in detail, as the time
between successive bleaches was too short to per-
mit equilibration. Therefore, we concluded parsi-
moniously that the rapidly moving and transiently
immobile populations were freely di¡using and
engaged fractions, respectively. Identi¢cation
of the transiently immobile fraction as the eng-
aged one was supported by the ¢nding that
5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole
(DRB) ^ a transcriptional inhibitor that blocks the
transition from initiation to elongation (Chodosh
et al. 1989, Marshall & Price 1992, Yamaguchi et
al. 1998) ^ reduced its size. Moreover, the half-life
of the elongating fraction in wild-type cells ^
which could be measured by labelling with [3H]uri-
dine ^ was *14min and so roughly similar to that
of the transiently immobile fraction.
We have now used FLIP to re-examine the kinet-
ics of the GFP-pol in C23 cells. As before, we
concentrate on changes occurring over the minutes
required to complete a transcription cycle (i.e.
including initiation, elongation, termination).
[Determining whether GFP-pol di¡uses as a core
enzyme of *500 kDa or larger complex of 1000^
2000kDa (Lee & Young, 2000) requires analysis
over fractions of a second and the development of
£uorescent standards of appropriate size.] Results
are consistent with the existence of three (or more)
populations: a large ‘free’ (rapidly-di¡using) one, a
small fraction resistant toDRB but sensitive to a dif-
ferent inhibitor of transcription (i.e. heat shock), and
the ‘engaged’ fractionsensitive toboth inhibitors.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
C23 cells, a clonal derivative of tsTM4 cells expre-
ssing the largest subunit of polymerase II (RPB1)
tagged with GFP under the control of the cyto-
megalovirus promoter (Sugaya et al. 2000), were
grown at 39C in Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen
Ltd, Paisley, UK) plus 10% fetal calf serum.
FLIP
Cells were grown in glass-bottomed microwell
dishes (Mat Tek, MA) for 40–48 h to 50% con-
ﬂuence. The standard FLIP experiment in Figure 1
was performed as described by Kimura et al.
(2002) using a Radiance 2000 confocal micro-
scope (488-nm-laser line; 25-mW argon laser at
4% power; 4 zoom; scan speed 600 lines/s; det-
ection using LP500 ﬁlter and pinhole setting 4;
image size 51.5 mm; BioRad Laboratories, Hemel
Hampstead, UK) ﬁtted on a TE300 microscope
(Nikon UK Limited, Kingston upon Thames,
136 M. Hieda et al.
Surrey, UK) and a 60  PlanApo objective
(numerical aperture 1.4). Cells were imaged at
39C on the microscope stage. A ﬁeld with two
cells was selected, imaged every *0.43 s for 30
images, and the bottom half of one nucleus
bleached with 100% laser power as the ﬁeld was
scanned every 0.43 s for another 130 s. The inten-
sity of the unbleached half of the bleached
nucleus was measured and normalized relative to
the unbleached nucleus (Phair & Misteli 2000).
Then, the relative intensity is given by:
½IðtÞ  BðtÞ=½KIðtÞ  BðtÞ
½Ið0Þ  Bð0Þ=½KIð0Þ  Bð0Þ
where I(t) is the average intensity of the unbleached
region of interest at time t, I(0) is the average
prebleach intensity of the region of interest aver-
aged over *15 s, KI(0) and KI(t) are the average
nuclear intensities of a neighbouring cell in the
same ﬁeld of view prior to bleaching and at time t,
respectively, and B(0) and B(t) are the average back-
ground ﬂuorescence outside cells in the same ﬁeld
prior to bleaching and at time t, respectively. The
alternative procedure (Figure 2, curves 4, 5) used
the laser at 2.5% power, 7 zoom, scan speed 500
lines/s, Kalman ﬁlter 7, pinhole setting 8, and data
was collected every 15 s to allow complete equili-
bration of mobile proteins. As a result, each experi-
ment involved repeats of 7 imaging/bleaching
scans (over 3.58 s) and 11.42 s without illumina-
tion; the Kalman ﬁlter combined the 7 scans into
one to provide images.
In some cases, 100mmol/L 5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-
ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) was added for
25min before FLIP, so the total time in DRB until
the last image was collected ranged from 25^57min.
The extent of transcriptional inhibition by the drug
was monitored by immuno£uorescence. Cells were
grown in DRB for 25 or 60min (the minimum and
maximum exposures) and ¢xed; 2.5mmol/L Br-U
was added 10min prior to ¢xation, and the resulting
Br-RNA indirectly immunolabelled (below). Treat-
ment with DRB for 25 and 60min reduced nucleo-
plasmic labelling (measured as below using >100
cells) to 34 12 and 16 5% of untreated controls,
respectively (not shown). As cells in the FLIP experi-
ment in Figure 2 were analysed in this time interval,
and as *8% residual activity is due to polymerase
III (Pombo et al. 1999), between 74 and 92% poly-
merase IIwould be inhibited.
In other cases, cells were heat shocked. The glass-
bottomed microwell dish was surrounded in waxy
¢lm, immersed in a water bath for 15min at 45C,
and incubated on the microscope stage at 45C for
up to another 20min during FLIP (total time at
45C was always<35min). This treatment also inhi-
bits most polymerase II activity; thus, in experiments
like the one illustrated inFigure 1C, the relative inten-
sities of nucleoplasmic labelling (average of >30
nuclei) at the four times were 100, 51 27, 12 5,
and 92 48, respectively (not shown). As the max-
imum exposure of cells in the FLIP experiment in
Figure 2 was 35min, and as*8% residual activity is
due to polymerase III (Pombo et al. 1999), all but 4%
polymerase II would then be inhibited. This value is
close to the 92%maximal inhibition seenwithDRB.
Data were analysed using kinetic models
based on standard principles of chemical kine-
tics (Phair & Misteli 2001, Dundr et al. 2002)
and ‘BerkeleyMadonna’ (http://www.berkeleyma
donna.com) and ‘MATLAB’ software (http://www.
mathworks.com). However, unconstrained optimi-
zation of parameters for various 3-population
ordinary di¡erential equation models yielded simi-
lar least-squares best ¢ts (not shown), such that we
were unable to discriminate conclusively between
them. For example, in one model a ‘free’ popula-
tion bound reversibly, and some of the resulting
‘bound’ fraction entered an ‘engaged’ or ‘elongat-
ing’ pool that returned to the ‘free’ pool on termi-
nation. In another, a ‘free’ population exchanged
directly with either an ‘engaged’ fraction or a
‘bound’ one (which could only pass to the
‘engaged’ fraction through the ‘free’ pool). We
believe that discriminating between such models
will require the acquisition of more and better
data, and the extension of the models to include
a more detailed description of the binding and
elongation processes, possibly considering the
duration of elongation in terms of delay di¡er-
ential equations.
Br-U incorporation
Cells were grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes
for 48 h. For heat shock treatment (Figure 1C),
the dishes were surrounded in waxy ﬁlm,
immersed in a water bath for various times (as
above), 2.5mmol/L Br-U added, and the cells
grown for 10min; after ﬁxation (20min; 20C)
RNA polymerase II in living cells 137
with 250mmol/L Hepes, 4% paraformaldehyde,
Br-RNA was indirectly immunolabelled using
a mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1/100
dilution of clone IU-4; Caltag laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) and donkey anti-mouse IgG
antibodies conjugated with Cy3 (1/200 dilution;
Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc, Bar Harbor, ME)
and images collected on the confocal microscope
(Pombo et al. 1999).
Numbers of GFP-pol/cell
The number of molecules of RNA polymerase II
in C23 cells growing at 39C was determined by
quantitative immunoblotting by reference to the
known number (i.e. 320 000) in a HeLa cell
grown at 37C (Kimura et al. 1999). All immu-
noblotting procedures were conducted at room
temperature unless stated otherwise. Cells in a
culture dish were lysed by adding a 2 concentrate
of the SDS-containing sample buffer used for
electrophoresis, sonicated (10–20 s using level 10
with the microprobe on the Soniprep 150; Sanyo
Gallenkamp PLC, Leicester, UK), heated at
98C for 5min, and proteins from 103 to 5 104
cells resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
After blotting on to nitrocellulose (Kimura et al.
1999), hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated forms of
the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II were
detected using a monoclonal antibody (clone
7C2; Besse et al. 1995), a donkey anti-mouse IgG
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson
Immunoresearch) and the peroxidase substrate
kit (AEC, Vector Laboratories Inc, Burlingame,
CA). Digital images were analysed using ‘Photo-
shop’ (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose,
CA), and the relative amounts of each band
determined by interpolation from the intensities
(measured in the linear range in the same blot)
seen for the corresponding bands given by differ-
ent dilutions of known numbers of HeLa cells.
Results
FLIP reveals two or more populations
We ﬁrst repeated the FLIP experiments per-
formed by Kimura et al. (2002), and obtained
similar results. A ﬁeld containing two nuclei was

(A) Example. Images of typical equatorial confocal sections
were collected before and after half of the lower nucleus
(contained in the white rectangle) was imaged/bleached every
0.43 s for 120 s. The upper nucleus is used as a reference, and
the signal to the right of the bleached area is an artifact. Bar:
10 mm. (B) Results (relative intensitySD; cell number 17).
Curve 1: untreated cells. Curve 2: cells treated with 100mmol/L
DRB for 25–55min before and 130 s during bleaching. Curve
3: cells heat-shocked at 45	C for 25–35min before and 130 s
during bleaching. Inset: The kinetics of curve 1 are consistent
with there being two (or more) populations that enter the
bleaching zone with different kinetics: here, three are shown.
One (‘free’) diffuses rapidly, the second (‘bound’) is attached
temporarily to some nuclear structure but is transcriptionally
inactive, while the third (‘engaged’) dissociates slowly from the
template. DRB would release the ‘engaged’ fraction to increase
the size of the ‘free’ fraction, and heat shock would release
both ‘bound’ and ‘engaged’ fractions. (C) Br-U incorporation
falls during heat shock and recovers thereafter. Cells were
heat-shocked (45	C) for 0, 10 or 35min, or heat shocked for
35min and regrown for 4.5 h (‘35 þ 4.5 h at 39	C’), and fixed;
in each case, 2.5mmol/L Br-U was added 10min prior to
fixation and the resulting Br-RNA indirectly immunolabelled
with Cy3 before equatorial sections were collected using a
confocal microscope. Bar: 10mm.

selected, and raster scanned repeatedly with the
laser as images were collected on a confocal
microscope (Figure 1A). The laser power was
varied during scanning. A low power sufﬁcient
for imaging was used for most of each scan, but
then the power was increased 25 for bleaching
as the laser scanned through a rectangle contain-
ing the bottom half of the lower nucleus. Unfor-
tunately, the power ﬂuctuations degrade the
image to the right of the rectangle. This process
was repeated every *0.43 s for 120 s until most
ﬂuorescence disappeared from the top half of the
bottom nucleus. The intensity in the unbleached
half of the nucleus was then expressed relative
to its original (unbleached) intensity, and the value
further corrected for the slight effects of bleaching
during imaging (using the reduction in ﬂuor-
escence seen in the other unbleached nucleus).
We can envisage several di¡erent results of such
bleaching. If all GFP-pol were freely di¡usible,
bleaching the bottom half should progressively
reduce the (relative) intensity in the top half to
zero because unbleached molecules can di¡use into
the target area and be bleached; this is the result
obtained in control cells expressing GFP (Kimura
et al. 2002). At the other extreme, all GFP-pol
might be immobile, and then the relative intensity
remains at unity because immobile molecules in
the top half can never enter the bleaching zone;
this is the result obtained with ¢xed cells (Kimura
et al. 2002). The results lie between these extremes,
and are consistent with the existence of two (or
more) populations. The larger population would
be able to di¡use rapidly into the bleaching zone,
while the smaller one leaves the top half of the
nucleus more slowly (Figure 1B, curve 1). The ¢rst
of these two populations would be equivalent to
the one labelled ‘free’ in the inset in Figure 1B,
while the second would contain both the ‘bound’
and ‘engaged’ populations. [These terms are used
operationally. Thus, the ‘free’ population includes
molecules able to translocate rapidly between the
two halves of the nucleus. They may bind to ^ and
dissociate rapidly from ^ chromatin and/or other
nuclear structures as they do so, and they may also
be part of a large di¡using complex. The ‘bound’
fraction may include molecules attached tempora-
rily to DNA (perhaps in a pre-initiation complex
or ‘sca¡old’; Yudkovsky et al. 2000) or some other
nuclear substructure (perhaps in some store).]
Kimura et al. (2002) suggest the second popula-
tion is mainly composed of the engaged fraction
(which would include both ‘elongating’ and ‘paused’
ternary complexes), and this was supported by
an additional experiment using the inhibitor of
Figure 2. GFP-pol kinetics analysed using an alternative FLIP
procedure. The procedure was as in Figure 1A&B except that
a 25.7-fold higher laser power was used and imaging/bleaching
took place 37.5-fold less frequently (i.e. every 15 s). (A) Data
obtained during the first 2min (curve 4). Curve 1 is redrawn
from Figure 1B. (B) Complete data set for 22min for untreated
cells (curve 4), or cells treated with 100mmol/L DRB for 25–57

curves 4 and 5 are consistent with the existence of at least 3
and 2 populations indicated by the straight lines, respectively.
RNA polymerase II in living cells 139
transcriptional elongation, DRB (Chodosh et al.
1989, Marshall et al. 1992, Yamaguchi et al.
1998). This drug inhibits P-TEFb kinase and so
hyper phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal
domain (CTD) of RPB1; such hyperpho-
sphorylation is characteristic of the active elongat-
ing enzyme. We also repeated these experiments
using exposures of <60min to minimize side
e¡ects. As the drug progressively inhibits more
and more transcription during the experiment, we
monitored the extent of inhibition at di¡erent
times; the shortest DRB treatment used reduced
transcription by polymerase II to *26% of
untreated controls, and the longest to *8%
(Materials and methods). Such treatments with
DRB ensured the relative intensity fell further
(Figure 1B, curve 2; see also Kimura et al. 2002);
presumably, any ‘bound’ and/or ‘engaged’ poly-
merases become soluble and so part of the freely-
di¡using fraction.
The simplest explanation of all these results is
that there are two kinetic fractions, one ‘free’ and
the other DRB-sensitive and ‘engaged’. As curve 2
in Figure 1B does not decay to zero (at least in the
time analysed), it could be assumed that DRB
does not inhibit all transcription by polymerase II
(as is the case) and/or some polymerase remains
engaged on very long transcription units. How-
ever, results are also consistent with other more
complicated interpretations, including the possibi-
lity that a third DRB-insensitive fraction exists
(labelled ‘bound’ in Figure 1B, inset). We now pre-
sent data consistent with this more complicated
interpretation using a di¡erent inhibitor, and an
alternative FLIP procedure.
Heat shock destabilizes most polymerase
Growth at 45C inhibits transcription (Lindquist
1986, Lis & Wu 1993). As photobleaching experi-
ments necessarily extend over a period of time
(in our case 25–37min) during which the heat
shock progressively inhibits more and more tran-
scription, we chose a protocol that inhibited
transcription to roughly the same extent as DRB
so results could be compared. The longest expo-
sures to DRB and 45C reduce transcription by
polymerase II (measured by immunoﬂuorescence
after a brief pulse of Br-U) to *8 and 4% of
untreated controls, respectively (Figure 1C;
Materials and methods). After the thermal shock
before and during FLIP, the relative intensity in
the unbleached area fell almost to zero (Figure
1B, curve 3). This provides formal proof that
heat shock leads to essentially the complete dis-
engagement of the polymerase from the template
so it becomes freely diffusible. The effects of this
heat treatment were reversible, as the transcrip-
tion rate recovers to *92% of untreated controls
after growth at the normal temperature for 4.5 h
(Figure 1C; Materials and methods).
DRB and heat shock inhibit RNA polymerase
II in di¡erent ways; the e¡ects on the relative inten-
sity are also di¡erent (Figure 1B, compare curves 2
and 3). This di¡erence suggests there might be at
least three kinetic fractions (Figure 1B, inset) ^ (1)
‘free’ (di¡usible), (2) ‘bound’ (sensitive to heat
shock but not DRB), and (3) ‘engaged’ (sensitive
to both heat shock and DRB). Then, DRB would
release only the ‘engaged’ fraction, while heat
shock would release both ‘bound’ and ‘engaged’
fractions.
An alternative FLIP procedure reveals multiple
kinetic fractions
Kimura et al. (2002) did not analyse curves like
those in Figure 1 in detail because the interval
between successive bleaches was too short to
allow equilibration of the mobile fraction
throughout the nucleus. Therefore, we lengthened
38-fold the interval between bleaches (i.e. from
0.43 to 15 s) to allow more time for this fraction
to equilibrate. We also increased the bleaching
power 26-fold to compensate in part for the less-
frequent bleaching, and extended the duration of
the experiment ten-fold (i.e. to >20min). This
‘alternative’ FLIP procedure yields curve 4 in
Figure 2A,B. Comparison of the original and
‘alternative’ procedures (curves 1 and 4 in Figure
2A) shows that the relative intensity given by the
‘alternative’ initially falls less rapidly; this is expec-
ted as the accumulated laser power used for
bleaching is less. However, the two curves con-
verge once the mobile GFP-pol is bleached. As
essentially all the ‘free’ fraction is eliminated using
the ‘alternative’ procedure by about 2min, analy-
sis of the kinetics of the other fraction(s) is
facilitated. After bleaching for 20min, the relative
intensity falls to 5% (Figure 2B, curve 4). As
140 M. Hieda et al.
before, pretreatment with DRB ensured the rela-
tive intensity fell further and more rapidly (Figure
2B, curve 5); presumably, most ‘engaged’ poly-
merases become soluble and so part of the freely-
diffusing fraction.
If there were three populations in untreated cells
that exchanged with very di¡erent kinetics (i.e.
‘free’, ‘bound’, and ‘engaged’), we might expect to
¢t a semilogarithmic plot of the data in curve 4
(Figure 2) with three straight lines (as in Figure
2C, curve 4); and ^ if DRB-treatment eliminated
one of these populations ^ we would expect to ¢t
the data with only two (as in Figure 2C, curve 5).
However, ¢ts, though adequate, were imperfect.
Nevertheless, results are consistent with the idea
that there are (at least) three populations, with one
being insensitive to DRB but sensitive to heat
shock.
Numbers of molecules in the different fractions
We next correlated the number of molecules of the
different forms of the polymerase in the cell with the
relative sizes of the different kinetic fractions. Mole-
cular numbers were determined by quantitative
immunoblotting (Kimura et al. 1999) using an anti-
body that recognizes the hyper- and hypophos-
phorylated forms of the C-terminal domain (CTD)
of RPB1 (i.e. IIO and IIA; Besse et al. 1995). HeLa
and the parental CHO-K1 cells contain IIO and IIA,
while C23 also contains hypo- and hyperphos-
phorylated GFP-pol (i.e. GFP-pol IIA and GFP-pol
IIO). When C23 is grown at 39
C, it contains little
endogenous and temperature-sensitive IIO (Figure 3).
We then related the fractions of the different forms
to the known numbers of the polymerase in an
equivalent number of HeLa cells (Figure 3; Table I).
Figure 3. The numbers of molecules of the largest (catalytic) subunit of RNA polymerase II in HeLa, C23, and CHO-K1 cells
determined by quantitative immunoblotting. Proteins from 3
 104 cells (lanes 1, 7), and doubling dilutions (lanes 2–6, 8–12) were
resolved on a gel, and the largest subunit detected by immunoblotting using the 7C2 antibody that recognizes both hyper- (IIO) and
hypo- (IIA) phosphorylated forms of the CTD.
Table I. The numbers of the different forms of the largest (catalytic) subunit of RNA polymerase II.

GFP-IIA 250000
Numbers were obtained by quantitative immunoblotting using images like that in Figure 3 (average of 3 experiments), assuming there are
320000 molecules in a HeLa cell (Kimura et al. 1999). HeLa and CHO-K1 were grown at 37	C, while C23 was grown at 39	C. a: similar
results were obtained by Jackson et al. (1998).
RNA polymerase II in living cells 141
Although C23 contains more than twice the total
number of molecules as the parental CHO-K1, num-
bers of the hyperphosphorylated form are similar
(compare GFP-IIO in C23 to IIO in CHO-K1 in
Table I). This is to be expected: CHO-K1 and C23
have similar sizes and grow at similar rates (Sugaya
et al. 2000), and it is mainly these forms that are
active (Dahmus 1996, Buratowski 2003). Con-
versely, the (inactive) hypophosphorylated form
constitutes *71% of the total GFP-pol (Table I)
compared with the *75% GFP-pol that constitutes
the rapidly exchanging (‘free’) fraction determined
by FRAP (Kimura et al. 2002). As expected, then,
the ‘free’ population is hypophosphorylated and

Discussion
One question arises in any study involving GFP
tagging: to what extent does the tagged protein
behave like its natural counterpart? The best way
of ensuring normal function is to replace the
endogenous gene with a hybrid gene encoding
the tagged protein, and show that the resulting
cells grow normally; this is rarely done in mam-
malian cells as precise gene replacement is so dif-
ﬁcult. An alternative is to utilize a mutant, and
demonstrate by genetic complementation that the
hybrid gene can restore normal function; this is
also rarely done as there are so few mutants. As
a result, most studies utilize ‘transient’ transfec-
tions that give populations of variably expressing
cells and then it is difﬁcult to prove that the tag-
ged protein functions normally. Here, we used a
clonal line expressing the largest (catalytic) sub-
unit of RNA polymerase II (i.e. RPB1) tagged
with GFP in addition to the exogenous genes,
but this leads to overexpression (Figure 3; Table
I). However, we did demonstrate complementa-
tion using the appropriate (temperature-sensitive)
mutant, so it must be the tagged molecule that
keeps this clone alive (Sugaya et al. 2000). More-
over, a signiﬁcant fraction of the GFP-pol (but
little of its endogenous temperature-sensitive
counterpart) is hyperphosphorylated (Figure 3)
and resistant to sarkosyl (Kimura et al. 2002),
two characteristics of the active enzyme (Dahmus
1996, Buratowski 2003). Even so, the diffusional
dynamics of the GFP-tagged protein must differ
from the endogenous protein, as it is inevitably
28 kDa larger – the size of the GFP tag. For this
and other reasons (Introduction), we concentrate
here on changes occurring over the minutes
required to complete a transcription cycle (i.e.
including initiation, elongation and termination)
and not on the changes occurring at shorter
times where diffusional kinetics dominate.
Our results con¢rm and extend those of Kimura
et al. (2002) and Becker et al. (2002). The former
expected to ¢nd at least three kinetic fractions of
GFP-pol: a large pool of enzyme able to di¡use
freely, a small fraction incorporated into the pre-
initiation complex, and a third that was elongating
and so temporarily immobilized on the template.
However, data could be ¢tted assuming there were
only two, with *75% moving rapidly and *25%
being transiently immobile; they concluded parsi-
moniously that the former was freely di¡using,
and the latter was elongating as it could be
released with DRB. We now use a di¡erent inhi-
bitor ^ a brief thermal shock (Lindquist 1986, Lis
& Wu 1993) ^ and ¢nd that it has a di¡erent e¡ect
from DRB (even though conditions were chosen
so that it inhibits transcription to the same extent).
Heat shock leads to almost complete disengage-
ment of the polymerase (Figure 1B, compare
curves 1 and 3), formally con¢rming results
obtained less directly (e.g. Gilmour & Lis 1985).
[We assume DRB and heat shock decrease the
engaged fraction by inhibiting early steps in the
transcription cycle, rather than speeding up later
steps like elongation and termination.] Data were
consistent with there being at least three kinetic
fractions ^ the rapidly-di¡using (‘free’) one, plus a
second sensitive to heat shock but not DRB, and a
third sensitive to both heat shock and DRB
(Figure 1B). Use of an alternative FLIP procedure
also revealed multiple kinetic fractions (Figure 2C).
How do these fractions relate to those known to
biochemists? The largest fraction is clearly inac-
tive; it exchanges rapidly (and so cannot be
engaged), and FRAP shows that it constitutes
*75% of the total (Kimura et al. 2002) which com-
pares with the*71% found as GFP-IIA by quanti-
tative immunoblotting (Table I). [Most of form
IIA is known to be inactive (Dahmus 1996).] Unfor-
tunately, it is di⁄cult to be sure about the other
two fractions, which are de¢ned through the
action of such unspeci¢c inhibitors, DRB and heat

shock. Nevertheless, one simple interpretation is
that one, which is DRB-insensitive but heat-shock
sensitive, is bound but not engaged, while the
other, which is sensitive to both DRB and heat
shock, is elongating.
In order to gain more insight into the transcrip-
tion cycle and amount of polymerase in the di¡er-
ent fractions, data were analysed using models
based on the principles of chemical kinetics (Mate-
rials and methods). Unfortunately, di¡erent mod-
els yielded kinetics that, using best-¢t values of the
model parameters, were consistent with much of
our data, and it was di⁄cult to discriminate
between them. We believe that suitable models will
necessarily have to be more complicated, and so
will require more and better data than we have at
present to enable us to discriminate between them.
These models will probably initially have to
include many di¡erent populations, so that we can
investigate whether some can be eliminated. These
populations include those that are exchanging with
the cytoplasm, freely-di¡using throughout nuclei,
bound transiently but non-productively (e.g. to
chromatin or inactive stores; Carrero et al. 2003),
bound at promoters, contained in pre-initiation
complexes, elongating, paused (Law et al. 1998),
and terminating. They may also have to involve
delay di¡erential equations to account for the dura-
tion of elongation, possibly with a suitable distribu-
tion of delay times to re£ect the widely di¡ering
lengths of transcription units found in mammalian
genomes.
Previous results using ¢xed cells have demon-
strated that nascent transcripts are concentrated
in discrete nucleoplasmic sites or ‘factories’ (Cook
1999). Why, then, are these factories not visible in
images like those in Figure 1A, especially when
most of the obscuring pool of free polymerases
has been removed by photobleaching? There are
probably two interrelated reasons. First, a typical
factory contains only *8 active polymerase mole-
cules, and it is di⁄cult to image so few GFP
molecules in a living cell. Second, the confocal
microscope has a resolution (at best) of *700 nm
in the z axis. Although individual factories
are seen in cryosections of *100 nm, they are too
numerous to be resolved in sections of *700 nm.
Therefore, imaging factories in living cells
awaits technical improvements in sensitivity and
resolution.
