STRONG LAWS FOR WEIGHTED
SUMS OF I.I.D. RANDOM VARIABLES
Guang-hui Cai
Abstract. Strong laws are established for linear statistics that
are weighted sums of a random sample. We show extensions of the
Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund strong laws under certain moment condi-
tions on both the weights and the distribution. The result obtained
extends and sharpens the result of Sung ([12]).
1. Introduction
Let {X,Xi, i ≥ 1} be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and
{ani, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, n ≥ 1} be a triangular array of constants. Through-
out this paper, we assume that φ(x) is a positive increasing function on
(0,∞) satisfying
φ(x) ↑ ∞ and φ(Cx) = O(φ(x)), ∀C > 0.(1)
We also assume that EX = 0 and E[φ(|X|)] <∞.
Many useful linear statistics based on a random sample are weighted
sums of i.i.d. random variables. Examples include least-squares esti-
mators, nonparametric regression function estimators and jackknife es-
timates, among others. In this respect, studies of strong laws for these
weighted sums have demonstrated significant progress in probability the-
ory with applications in mathematical statistics. Let {X,Xi, i ≥ 1} be
a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and {ani, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, n ≥ 1} be a
triangular array of constants. The almost sure (a.s.) limiting behavior
of weighted sums
∑n
i=1 aniXi was studied by many authors (see, Sung
[12], Sung [11], Bai and Cheng [1], Choi and Sung [2], Cuzick [4], Li et
al, 1995, Wu [3]). Recently Sung [12] proved the following strong laws
of large numbers (see Theorem A and Theorem B).

Theorem A. Let {X,Xi, i ≥ 1} be a sequence of i.i.d. random vari-
ables satisfying EX = 0 and E[φ(|X|)] < ∞. Assume that the inverse
function ψ(x) of φ(x) satisfies

Let {ani, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, n ≥ 1} be a triangular array of constants such that

Theorem B. Let {X,Xi, i ≥ 1} be a sequence of i.i.d. random
variables satisfying EX = 0, EX2 < ∞ and E[φ(|X|)] < ∞. Let
{ani, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, n ≥ 1} be a triangular array of constants such that
(i) max1≤i≤n |ani| = O( 1ψ(n)),
(ii)
∑n
i=1 a

ni = O(

n∑

aniXi → 0 a.s.
As for negatively associated (NA) random variables, Joag [7] gave the
following definition.
Definitions 2.2 ([7]). A finite family of random variables {Xi, 1 ≤
i ≤ n} is said to be negatively associated (NA) if for every pair of disjoint
subsets T1 and T2 of {1, 2, . . . , n}, we have
Cov(f1(Xi, i ∈ T1), f2(Xj , j ∈ T2)) ≤ 0,
whenever f1 and f2 are coordinatewise increasing and the covariance
exists. An infinite family is negatively associated if every finite subfamily
is negatively associated.
The main purpose of this paper is to establish the Marcinkiewicz-
Zygmund strong laws for linear statistics of i.i.d. sequences and NA
sequences of random variables. The results obtained (see Theorem 2.1,
Theorem 2.2, Corollary 2.1 and Corollary 2.2) extends and sharpens the
result of Sung [12].

2. The Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund strong laws
Throughout this paper, C will represent a positive constant though
its value may change from one appearance to the next, and an = O(bn)
will mean an ≤ Cbn, and an ¿ bn will mean an = O(bn). Let ψ(x) be
the inverse function of φ(x). Since φ(x) ↑ ∞, it follows that ψ(x) ↑ ∞.
For easy notation, we let φ(0) = 0 and ψ(0) = 0.
In order to prove our results, we need the following lemmas and
the concept of complete convergence. As for complete convergence, let
{X,Xn, n ≥ 1} be a sequence of independent identically distribution
random variables (i.i.d) random variables and denote Sn =
∑n
i=1Xi.
The Hsu-Robbins-Erdo¨s law of large numbers (Hsu and Robbins [6];
Erdo¨s [5]) states that
∀ε > 0,
∞∑
n=1
P (|Sn| > εn) <∞
is equivalent to EX = 0 and EX2 <∞.
This is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and has been
intensively investigated by many authors in the past decades. We can see
in Petrov [8], Chow [3] and Stout [10]. There have been many extensions
in various directions for Hsu-Robbins-Erdo¨s law of large numbers.
Lemma 2.1 (Petrov [8]). Let {Xi, i ≥ 1} be a sequence of i.i.d.
random variables, EXi = 0, E|Xi|p < ∞ for some p ≥ 2 and for every
i ≥ 1. Then there exists C = C(p), such that

Lemma 2.2 (Sung [12]). Assume that the inverse function ψ(x) of
φ(x) satisfies (2). If E[φ(|X|)] <∞, then the followings hold.

If E[φ(|X|)] <∞, then

Proof. The proof of Lemma 2.3 is similar to the proof of Lemma
2.2.
Lemma 2.4 (Shao [9]). Let {Xi, i ≥ 1} be a sequence of negatively
associated mean zero random variables with E|Xi|p <∞. Then for any
p ≥ 2, there exists C=C(p) such that

Theorem 2.1. Let {X,Xi, i ≥ 1} be a sequence of i.i.d. random
variables satisfying EX = 0, EX2 < ∞ and E[φ(|X|)] < ∞. Let Tn =

By Lemma 2.3 and Kronecker Lemma, then

From (8), then (6) is true.
From (5) and (6), it follows that for n large enough
P ( max

|Tj | > ε) ≤

P (|Xj | > ψ(n)) + P ( max

Hence we need only to prove that

From the fact that E[φ(|X|)] <∞, it follows easily that
I =

P (|X| > ψ(n))

Now we complete the prove of Theorem 2.1.

Hence

Then we have

Now we complete the prove of Corollary 2.1.
Theorem 2.2. Let {X,Xi, i ≥ 1} be a sequence of NA random
variables satisfying EX = 0, EX2 < ∞ and E[φ(|X|)] < ∞. Let Tn =

Proof. The proof of Theorem 2.2 is similar to the proof of Theorem
2.1.
Corollary 2.2. Under the conditions of Theorem 2.2, then
